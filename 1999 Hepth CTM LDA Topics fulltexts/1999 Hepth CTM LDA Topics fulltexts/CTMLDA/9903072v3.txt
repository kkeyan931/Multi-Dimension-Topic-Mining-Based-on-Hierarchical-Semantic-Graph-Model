abstract

we consider the simplest bosonictype s-matrix which is usually regarded as un-
physical due to the complex values of the nite volume ground state energy. while
a standard quantum eld theory interpretation of such a scattering theory is pre-
cluded, we argue that the physical situation described by this smatrix is of a
massive ising model perturbed by a particular set of irrelevant operators. the
presence of these operators drastically aects the stability of the original vacuum
of the massive ising model and its ultraviolet properties.

1 introduction

in recent years, remarkable progress has been witnessed in the study of the scaling region
nearby the xed points of the renormalization group (rg) of 2-d statistical models.
such progress has been possible thanks to new ideas related to the smatrix theory [1, 2]
and there is now a welldened program to analyse ocritical statistical models.
in
short, this usually consists in implementing the following steps: (a) a deformation of
a conformal field theory (cft) describing the critical point by means of a relevant
integrable operator which drives the model away from criticality; (b) a consequent de-
termination of the exact spectrum of the massive or massless excitations and the elastic
smatrix scattering amplitudes thereof; (c) and nally, a reconstruction of the ocritical
correlators by means of the form factor approach also accompanied by an analysis of
the nite size behaviour of the theory by means of the thermodynamics bethe ansatz
(tba). the scattering theory of the ising model in a magnetic eld [2] together with
the calculation of its correlators [3] provide an explicit example of a statistical model
solved away from criticality along the line of the above program. solutions for many
other ocritical models have also been found (see for instance [3-19]). hereinafter the
statistical models solved according to an smatrix program will be simply referred as
bootstrap models.

all known boostrap models greatly dier from each other by the nature of their spec-
trum, for the total number of particles and for the detailed structure of their scattering
amplitudes. however, looking at them as a whole, they share an important feature, which
consists in the fermionic nature of their scattering amplitudes. namely, the s-matrix in-
volving two identical particles takes the value 1 at the threshold of their s-channel, i.e.
saa(0) = 1 (for the notation see below). this condition was proved to be quite im-
portant in the further study of their oshell behaviour. in the thermodynamics bethe
ansatz calculations, for instance, fermionictype s-matrices lead to welldened integral
equations which  in all known models  provide real solutions for the ground state en-
ergy, in perfect agreement with the cft prediction [14, 15]. on the other hand, in the
form factor approach, fermionic smatrices give rise to spectral series of the correlation
functions with fast convergent properties (see for instance, [3, 9, 10, 11, 12]).

among the set of known solved models the peculiar absence of examples relative to
an smatrix of bosonictype, i.e. an s-matrix which satises the condition saa(0) = 1,
is indeed intriguing. what is the reason? while a widespread suspicion is that such
s-matrices are unphysical1, a full understanding of their features and also of their inter-

1 it is worth mentioning that in an example based on the algebraic bethe ansatz [23], which is a
dierent approach to that of this paper, it was shown that the physical vacuum of the theory could only
be constructed if the particles were of fermionic type.

pretation are still missing.

deeply related to the absence of models with a bosonictype smatrix, there is also
the question about the role played in the scattering theory by the socalled cdd factors.
it is well known that they give rise to ambiguity in the smatrix of a bootstrap system
and it seems therefore quite striking that all consistent boostrap models have managed
to successfully resolve this ambiguity.

the aim of this paper is to address some of the above questions. in particular, we
will draw some conclusions about the interpretation of the physical aspects which occur
in an integrable theory based on a bosonictype s-matrix. we will consider the simplest
nontrivial scattering theory of this kind, consisting of one selfconjugate particle a of
mass m, with the twoparticle s-matrix given by

saa() = 

sinh   i sin a
sinh  + i sin a  fa() .

(1.1)

unless explicitly stated, a is a real parameter which, for the invariance of the smatrix
under a  1  a, can be taken in the interval [0, 1/2]. in eq. (1.1)   1  2, where
i is the rapidity variable of each particle entering its relativistic dispersion relation
ei = m cosh i, pi = m sinh i. since the mandelstam variable s is given by s = (p1 +
p2)2 = 2m2(1 + cosh ), the threshold in this channel is reached when  = 0 and for the
s-matrix (1.1) we have

saa(0) =( 1

if a 6= 0 ;
1 if a = 0 ,

(1.2)

i.e. a bosonictype s-matrix except when a = 0. notice that the asymptotical behaviour
of this smatrix is given by lim s() = 1. as it will become clear in the next
section, the smatrix (1.1) can also be equivalently regarded as a pure cdd factor
added to an initial fermionictype smatrix.

a word of caution.

in the following we will often use the terminology qft to
denote briey and concisely a hypotetical theory underlying the scattering processes.
the terminology does not automatically mean that this underlying theory is a consistent
quantum field theory, the peculiar features of which are precisely the object of analysis.
the paper is organised as follows. in section 2 we briey discuss the cdd factors
and their relation with a perturbed cft. in section 3 we discuss the diculties which
the bosonictype smatrix (1.1) pose both in the tba analysis and in the form factor
approach  diculties which prevents its interpretation in terms of a standard quantum
eld theory. section 4 is devoted to an interpretation of the bosonictype smatrix (1.1)
as the one coming from the critical ising model perturbed by a combination of relevant
and irrelevant operators. we will argue that this combination induces an instability in
the ground state of the theory, in agreement with the results of the tba analysis for the
bosonictype smatrix (1.1). finally our conclusions are summarised in section 5.

2 cdd factors and deformations of cft

to analyse the scaling region around a critical point described by a cft, one usually
considers the deformation of the conformal action acf t by means of one of its relevant
operators (x)

a = acf t + z (x)d2x .

(2.1)

the resulting action  which describes a rg ow from the original cft to another xed
point  gives rise in the minkowski space to the scattering processes among the massless
or massive excitations present away from the critical point [2]. important simplications
occur when the action (2.1) denes an integrable quantum eld theory: in this case, in
fact, all the scattering processes are purely elastic and can be expressed in terms of the
two-particle scattering amplitudes sab(). on a general basis, these amplitudes satisfy
the unitarity and crossing symmetry conditions2

sab()sab() = 1 ;
sab() = sab(i  ) .

(2.2)

possible bound states which occur in the scattering processes are promoted to asymptotic
states so that the amplitudes satisfy the additional bootstrap equations

scd() = sbd(  iua
ab is the location of the simple pole in sab() which identies the

bc)sad( + iub

ac) ,

(2.3)

where u    u and iuc
bound state ac in the scattering channel aaab  aaab.

the solution of the above equations presents the wellknown ambiguity relative to
the cdd factors. let sab() be a set of functions with a minimum number of poles which
solve both eqs. (2.2) and (2.3). another solution of the rst equations (2.2) can easily
be obtained by multiplying each amplitude sab() by the socalled cdd factors, i.e. an
arbitrary product of functions fa() dened in eq. (1.1), sab()  cab() sab(), where
cab() = qnab
in fact, each fa() automatically satises eqs. (2.2) and hence
their product. additional constraints on such cdd factors may come from the bootstrap
equations (2.3), which they also have to satisfy. since the cdd factors do not introduce
extra poles in the physical sheet 0  im   , the conclusion is that the knowledge of
the structure of the bound states alone cannot uniquely x the scattering theory. this
ambiguity is however not harmless since scattering theories which dier by cdd factors
have a distinct physical content, in particular a dierent ultraviolet behaviour3.

fai().

ai

2for simplicity we consider here theories with a massive non-degenerate spectrum of self-conjugate

particles.

3a well known example is provided by the ane toda field theories [17, 18] which share the same

structure of bound states of some deformed cft but have dierent central charges [15].

3

how can we interpret smatrices which dier by cdd factors in terms of an under-
lying action? first of all, the cdd factors do not spoil  by construction  the integrable
nature of the original smatrix, simply because they only add extra phaseshifts to the
original elastic scattering amplitudes. moreover, they also do not alter the structure of
the bound states  an infrared property of theory , because they do not introduce extra
poles in the smatrix. since they mainly inuence the ultraviolet behaviour, it seems
natural to assume that smatrices related to one another by cdd factors are associated
to integrable actions which, in the vicinity of a xed point, may dier for insertion of
irrelevant scalar operators4 i(x)

a = acf t + z (x) d2x + iz i(x) d2x .

(2.4)

these irrelevant operators should preserve the set of conserved currents (or part of it) of
the original action (2.1) and they should also share the same symmetry properties of the
relevant operator (x). their presence has however several consequences. in fact,from a
rg geometric point of view the irrelevant operators i(x) are associated to rg trajectories
which ow into the xed point, whereas the relevant operators are associated to those
rg trajectories which depart from it. hence, the simultaneous presence of relevant and
irrelevant operators gives rise to a rg trajectory which will pass very closely to the xed
point in question but without stopping at it (figure 1). in its vicinity, its action can
be parameterised as in (2.4). however, in contrast with the qft dened by the action
(2.1), the action given by eq. (2.4) does not automatically ensure the consistency of the
relative quantum eld theory in the entire rg space of the couplings, i.e. on all possible
distance scales. obviously, there are some preliminary steps in order to give a meaning
to the expression (2.4).

first of all, the irrelevant operators initially present in (2.4) will be accompanied by
an innite number of counterterms, so that the nal form of the action of the theory will
be actually given by the one of (2.4) together with this innite tower of higher irrelevant
operators. this status of art however is not catastrophic as it may appear since the theory
can still remain predictive in view of the fact that all counterterms can be constrained by
the request of integrability [20, 21]. a real source of problem is another one. in fact, in
contrast to those theories which are obtained by perturbing a cft by means of relevant
operators, where their ultraviolet behaviour is completly under control and ruled in fact
by the initially cft, the ultraviolet behaviour of those quantum eld theories dened
as in (2.4) will be, instead, apriori unknown. since at the short distances the eective

4 it is worth mentioning that the same line of reasoning has been successfully applied in the context
of boundary quantum field theories, with the cdd factors entering the reection scattering matrix
put in correspondance with the irrelevant boundary deformations of the theory, see [19].

coupling constants of the irrelevant operators become extremely large, it should not be
a surprise to nd out that one may dene a consistent quantum eld theory in this
regime only for special sign of the leading irrelevant coupling5. this condition is realised,
for instance, for the roaming trajectory of the toda field theories [22] which in each
neighborhood of the xed points it passes, may be regarded as a rg ow induced by
a combination of the relevant operator  = 1,3 and the irrelevant operator  = 3,1,
for an appropriate set of the couplings [24]. on the contrary, another choice of the sign
of the couplings nearby the critical points may induce an ultraviolet instability of the
ground state of the theory at certain scale  which will spoil a quantum eld theory
interpretation for distance scales r  . as we will see, this seems to be the scenario
associated to the smatrix (1.1).

3 diculties with the bosonictype smatrix

a deceptively simple smatrix aected by a cdd ambiguity is obtained by multiplying
a scattering amplitude saa() by 1 (which may be considered as a particular fa term,
2 +i()). if the original scattering theory does not have any bound states,
i.e. lim f 1
i.e.
if there are no constraints coming from the nonlinear bootstrap equations (2.3),
there is evidently no obstacle to this multiplication. consequently, by means of this
cdd factor we can swap from a fermionictype smatrix to a bosonic one and viceversa.
this is the case, for instance of the smatrix of the sinh-gordon model, which is given
by ssh = fb(), where b is a function of the coupling constant of the model [5]. the
result of this multiplication is in fact the bosonictype smatrix (1.1). for this reason,
the model associated to the smatrix (1.1) may be referred to as minus sinh-gordon
model (mshg).

there is, however, another way of looking at the smatrix (1.1). it may be seen, in
fact, as the one obtained by multiplying s = 1 by a cdd factor fa(). s = 1 is the
smatrix of the thermal ising model [4] and therefore the analysis of this bosonictype
smatrix may be pursued along the considerations presented in the previous section,
as will be done in section 4.
in the meantime, let us investigate what is the nature
of the problems which are posed by the bosonictype smatrix (1.1), regardless of its
interpretation. we will initially study its nite size and ultraviolet behaviour by means

5there is a simple and even trivial analogy of this situation with other quantum eld theory problems:

let us consider for instance the hamiltonian of massive boson h = 1
add the interaction 6. assume that the solution of the theory at  = 0 is exactly known. although
a perturbation theory can be formally applied for any sign of the new coupling , it is obvious that
the new hamiltonian will dene a consistent theory only for positive values of this coupling since for 
negative, no matter how small it may be, there is no longer a stable vacuum.

3.1 thermodynamical properties

there is a simple way to see that the theory dened by the s-matrix (1.2) presents some
problematic aspects from the point of view of a quantum eld theory. let us compute
in fact the free energy f (mr) of such a theory on a cylinder of length l and radius r
(with l  r) by means of the tba approach [13, 14]. as usual, r1 can be interpreted
as the temperature of the onedimensional system living on an innite line, r1 = t .
as it is wellknown, once the free energy f (mr) has been computed, the ground state
casimir energy e0(mr)  parameterised in terms of the eective central charge c(mr)
as

(3.1)

(3.2)

will be given by

e0(mr)  

e0(mr) = f (mr) .


6r

c(mr) ,

in the tba approach, the free energy f (mr) is initially expressed in terms of the

functional

f (, (r)) = e((r)) 

1
rs(, (r))  n ((r)) .

the energy term is given by

e((r)) =z m cosh  (r)() d ,

the entropy term, in the bosonic case, is given by

s(, (r)) =z d(cid:2)( + (r)) log( + (r))   log   (r) log (r)(cid:3) ,

and the particle number is expressed as

n ((r)) =z (r)() d .

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

in the above formulas, (r)() is the density of occupied states (roots) of rapidity 
whereas () is the total density of states (roots and holes),  = (r) + (h). they are
related each other by the integral equation

let us assume that the functional (3.3) admits a minimum with respect to the distribu-
tions () and (r)(), with eq. (3.7) acting as a constraint. if this would be the case, the
partition function z(l, r) in the presence of a chemical potential  (z  er) and in the
limit l   can be computed in the saddle point approximation and expressed as

in terms of (), the distributions () and (r)() which provide the minimum for the
functional (3.3) are related each other by

(3.10)

the above discussion briey summarises the basic ideas of the thermodynamical
bethe ansatz approach. let us now analyse how they are actually implemented in the
case of our bosonic model, starting our analysis from the expression of the freeenergy
obtained in the saddle point approximation of the tba equations, i.e. from eqs. (3.8) and
(3.9). at zero chemical potential z = 1, no matter how small a may be (but never zero),
the numerical solution of the above equations shows the existence of a critical value of
the variable r, such that for r < rc(a), the free energy assumes complex values (figure
2). it is worth noting the novelty of this situation, which in fact does not occur in all
other known (fermionic) models, analysed in the past in terms of the tba equations (see,
for instance, [15]). how can we interpret the occurrence of this critical point in r and
the complex values assumed by the free energy for r < rc? what are the consequences
of this result? the answer to these questions may be expressed both in physical or in
purely mathematical terms.

the simplest physical answer is the following. since the tba equations provides the
full resummation of the virial expansion of z(l, r), r1
c (a) is then identied with the
radius of convergence of the corresponding series. the existence of this singularity indi-
cates a non-trivial ultraviolet behaviour of the theory, in particular, it denetly precludes
its standard interpretation in terms of a conformal field theory deformed by a relevant
operator6.

6 the problem with the ultraviolet behaviour of such theory can also be seen without having recourse

7

the singularity at r = rc(a) may be eectively regarded as a sort of boseeinstein
condensation phenomenon. to show this, rstly notice that the partition function (3.8)
admits an interpretation as that of a free bosonic gas of exitations |()i but with disper-
sion relations which depend on the temperature [13]. in particular, for the energy e()
of one of these excitations |()i we have e()  ()/r, where () is solution of the
integral equation (3.9). hence, in a way completely similar to the fermionic case anal-
ysed in [25], one can establish the equivalence between the partition function obtained in
eq. (3.8) and the one computed in terms of the following series

z(l, r) =



xn=0

zn h(n) . . . (1)|(1) . . . (n)ie((1)++(n)) ,

(3.11)

where the scalar product of the states is computed according to the commutation rules
of free bosonic particles, with a regularization given by

[(  )]2 

ml
2

cosh() (  ) .

(3.12)

in fact, for the partition function in (3.8) we have the following expansion in powers of
(ml)

z(l, r) = 1  (ml)f (r) +

(ml)2

2!

(f (r))2 +    (1)n (ml)n

on the other hand, computing the partition function by using the expression (3.11),

to numerical integration of the above equations. in fact, in consistent theories, the ultraviolet behaviour
is ruled by the socalled kink conguration of eq. (3.9) and the corresponding dilogarithmic functions.
in our case the plateau of the kink conguration, solution of algebraic equation pl = log(1  epl) is in
fact complex, pl = i

etc. hence, it is easy to see that the series (3.13) precisely coincides with that of eq. (3.16),
the only dierence being in the arrangement of the single terms: the terms proportional
to (ml) in all zn gives f (r) as their sum, whereas the sum of the terms proportional to
(ml)n appearing in all zn gives rise to the higher power (f (r))n.

in the light of these considerations, it is then natural to expect that the partition
function (3.8) will have a singularity at that value of the temperature r1
c (a) where
the energy of the excitation (at zero rapidity) vanishes (figure 3). when this happens,
the contribution coming from the average occupation number with e = 0 becomes as
important as the entire series, producing a singularity in the free energy which resembles
that of the usual boseeinstein condensation. one should not be surprised that such
eect occurs in this low dimensional system due to the entanglement of the energy e()
of its excitation with the temperature itself of the system. in conclusion, from the tba
analysis one infers that in our bosonictype model there is a scale of distance  = rc
below which there is a change in the ground state of the theory. obviously it is not
surprising to nd out that the evaluation of the series beyond its radius of convergence
provides complex values, although no direct physical meaning can be assigned to them.
from a purely mathematical point of view, the occurrence of complex values in f (r)
simply indicates the failure of the minimization procedure applied to evaluate the free
energy (3.3). namely, in our case, it is no longer true that the functional (3.3) admits
a minimum with respect to the (positive) real distributions () and (r)() for any
value of r. as a matter of fact, the real minima of the functional (3.3) disappear for
r  rc, becoming complex. hence the value of the functional (3.3) computed at its
minima, i.e. r f (r), takes for r < rc complex values whereas the functional f (, (r))
itself becomes instead unbounded from below for this range of r. this implies that the
saddle point procedure employed by the tba is no longer justied7. however, if we still
insist on enforcing the validity of the relationship (3.2) between the freeenergy and the
casimir energy of the theory, we should conclude that the divergence of the freeenergy
for r  rc implies the corresponding divergence of the central charge of the theory. as
7this circumstance is analysed in full detail in appendix a for simplied version of a tba system

based on a particular bosonic smatrix.

9

we will show in the next section, the same conclusion is also reached by using the form
factor approach.

3.2 form factors

let us now analyse the computation of the form factors associated to the smatrix (1.1).
as we will see, this calculation presents some new and distinct features with respects the
analogous calculation for fermionictype theories.

the denition of the form factors of a local hermitian scalar operator o is given as

usual by

f o(1, . . . , n) = h0|o|a(1), . . . , a(n)i .

(3.19)

these quantities satisfy a set of functional equations [6, 7]

which closely resemble those of the sinhgordon theory [26].

for scalar operators, the ff depend solely on the rapidity dierences ij = i  j.
as it is evident from the residue equation in (3.20), the chain of ff with even and odd
number of particles are decoupled from each other. for simplicity, in the sequel we will
consider only ff of even operators under the z2 symmetry of the model (i.e.
those
which have only nonvanishing ff on an even number of external states). they can be
correspondingly parameterised as

where xi = ei, hn is a normalization constant and fmin() is a function which satises
the equations

fmin()

= s() fmin() ,
fmin(i  ) = fmin(i + ) .

(3.22)

qn(x1, . . . , xn) are symmetric polynomials in the variables x1, . . . , xn of total degree

although at a formal level, the above formulas of the ff appear identical to those of the
sinhgordon model (except for the extra factor (n)
2 in the denominator), a substantial
dierence between the two models occurs in the properties of fmin(). as we will see,
this dierence has farreaching consequences.

(3.31)

the residue equation in (3.20) implies that the polynomials qn(x1, . . . , xn) in eq. (3.21),
satisfy the recursive equations

qn+2(x, x, x1, . . . , xn) = x3d(x, x1, . . . , xn) qn(x1, . . . , xn) ,

since d(x, x1, . . . , xn) contains four elementary symmetric polynomials and each of them
is linear in the individual variables xi, the partial degrees pn of the polynomials qn
satises the condition pn+2  4 + pn.

after these general considerations, let us now attempt to solve the above recursive
equations for a particular but signicant eld. namely, let us assume that there is an
operator in the theory which plays the role of the trace (x) of the stressenergy tensor
t(x). if such an operator exists, its form factors have some distinguished properties
which may be useful in their explicit determination. first of all, its normalization will
be given by

f (i) = ha()|(0)|a()i = 2m2 .

(3.35)

secondly, from the conservation law t(x) = 0, the polynomials qn(x1, . . . , xn) can
be factorised as qn(x1, . . . , xn) = 1n1pn(x1, . . . , xn). moreover, assuming that this
operator is even under the z2 symmetry of the model, its only nonvanishing ff will
be those with an even number of external particles. finally, the twopoint correlation

since at the large distance scale the theory is massive, we will have cir = 0, and the
above sumrule should provide a determination of the central charge cuv of the theory
in its ultraviolet regime. the rst approximation of the above sumrule is obtained by
the twoparticle contribution

(3.38)

with this information on the ff of (x), let us proceed in the computation of its rst
representatives. since in the limit a  0, our bosonictype smatrix reduces to the one
of thermal ising model  for which the only nonvanishing ff of (x) is the one relative
to the twoparticle state

we are forced to take as q2(x1, x2)

notice that by inserting the twoparticle ff in (3.38), the corresponding quantity is
an increasing function of the parameter a, which takes its minimum value c (2) = 1
2
at a = 0 (as in the thermal ising model) and reaches its maximum c (2) = 0.876... at
a = 1
2 (see figure 4). this increasing monotonic behaviour of c (2)(a) is in contrast with
the decreasing monotonic behaviour presented by the same quantity for fermionictype
theories (see for instance the sinh-gordon model [26]).

using now the factorised form q4(x1, . . . , x4) = 13p4(x1, . . . , x4) and the above

expression for q2(x1, x2), the recursive equation satised by p4(x1, . . . , x4) becomes

this arbitrariness in the fourparticle ff of (x) may be partially reduced by imposing an
additional condition on its ff, namely that they fulll the cluster equations [15, 28, 29]

(3.43)

by using the cluster properties of the elementary symmetric polynomials k, as deter-
mined in [15], together with the asymptotical behaviour eq. (3.29) of fmin(, a) and the
vacuum expectation value hi = m2
2 sin a, the cluster equation (3.43) provides the following
conditions on the constants a1 and a2

a1 = 1 , a2 = 4 .

(3.44)

however, the constant a3 cannot be xed in this way, since all terms proportional to it
in (3.42) are subleading in the above limit (3.43). this arbitrariness of the ff of (x),
which persists for higher ff, shows that in the mshg model the smatrix alone cannot
uniquely x the matrix elements of one of its signicant operators. this arbitrariness
in the ff of (x) should be contrasted with their unique determination in all known
examples of fermionictype smatrix10 (see, for instance [3, 9, 12, 26]).

concerning the ctheorem sum rule, some conclusions can be also drawn despite
the arbitrariness present in the ff of (x). namely, let us assume that the arbitrary
constants present at each stage of the recursive equations could be xed according to
some additional principle. what will then be the generic behaviour of the series (3.37)
entering the ctheorem? for the niteness of the value assumed by the ff at all particle
thresholds, an estimate of the integral (3.36) can be provided by only considering the
contributions at all thresholds. to do so, let us rst observe that the sum (3.37)  apart
from the prefactor 12/3 , is an integral of the square of each ff integrated on the
phasespace 2k() of 2k particle, dened as

2k() =z

(  e1      e2k) (p1 +    p2k) .

(3.45)

10it is easy to check that also higher form factors of z2 odd operators (as the one which creates the

particle a of the mshg model) cannot uniquely xed.

(3.46)

concerning the value of the f2k(1, . . . , 2k) at their threshold (ij = 0, for all i and
j), we can split it into two terms: the rst one is the product of h2k together with all
fmin(0), given by

an estimate of the ratio  =

values assumed by the elementary symmetric polynomials j at i = 0 (denoted by j)

k !  4k. at the threshold, in the space of symmetric polynomials of total
k =   2k
degree k(4k  1) and partial degree 2(2k  1), the term which is expected to dominate
in the limit k   is given by [(k)4k32k]  162k2 3
2 k, so that   16 and the ratio 
is therefore expected to be always larger than 1.

let us now apply the above considerations to the ctheorem sumrule. we will approx-
imate the integral (3.36) by using the mean theorem, applied in each interval between
all successive thresholds. apart from some constants, the series entering eq. (3.36) has
the following behaviour11

where

(3.49)

(3.50)

the nature of the series (3.49) is obviously controlled by the parameter x(a): since the
ratio f (a)
2 sin a entering x(a) is always larger than 1.6.. ( see figure 5) and  is expected to

11eq. (3.49) holds for a 6= 0. for a = 0, the ctheorem gives c = 1

15

be larger than 1, we conclude that, due to the nite value assumed by the ff at the higher
thresholds, the series (3.49) is always divergent. this divergence should be regarded as a
manifestation of the pathological aspect of the quantum eld theory associated to mshg
model in its ultraviolet region, as we already learnt by the tba approach.

4 irrelevant deformations of the ising model

with the above insights to the nature of the problems presented by the bosonictype s
matrix (1.1), let us come back to the considerations of section 2 with the aim to identify
an underlying action for such an smatrix. we will take the point of view in which fa()
in eq. (1.1) is seen as a cdd factor for the fermionic smatrix s = 1. the latter is
identied as the one of the thermal ising model. hence, we have to look for irrelevant
operators in this model which both preserve its original integrability and its z2 symmetry
such that the extra phaseshift which they induce matches with the cdd factor fa().
in fact, we
have the operators of the conformal family of the identity i (which includes the stress
energy tensor t), those of the conformal family of the energy eld e and nally those
of the magnetization eld . the operators of the even sector of this model, i.e. those
of identity and energy families, can be written in terms of local expressions of the chiral
(z) and antichiral (z) components of a majorana fermionic eld. in particular we
have e(z, z) = i (z)(z) and, for the analytic and antianalytic part of the stress energy
tensor, t (z) = 1

in the conformal ising model there are few operators we can play with:

2 :  : and t = 1

2 :    : .

the original fermionictype smatrix s = 1 originates from the cft action per-

turbed by the relevant operator of the energy eld

a = acf t + mz e(x)d2x .

in the euclidean space it may be written as

a =

1

2 z (  +   + 2im ) d2x .

(4.1)

(4.2)

let us analyse which operators we can add to this action in order to have an extra phase
shift in the smatrix. none of these operators can be of the magnetic eld family as they
would spoil both its z2 symmetry and its integrability [16, 31, 32]. they cannot be either
descendent elds of the energy eld, since they are all quadratic in the fermionic eld:
their insertion in the action (4.2) will not induce scattering processes among the fermion
particles but will only change their dispersion relations. hence, the rst irrelevant eld
which can be introduced in (4.1) in order to have extra scattering processes is t t . this

16

operator is in fact quartic in the fermion elds and the new action becomes

a =

1

2 z (cid:0)  +   + 2im (cid:1) d2x +

g

2m2 z     d2x +   

(4.3)

where g is a dimensionless constant. with the insertion of this operator, the theory is still
integrable at the lowest order [33] although a in (4.3) should be considered at this stage
as an eective action. the coupling constant g can be related to the parameter a entering
the smatrix (1.1) as follows. since the operator t t is expected to be eective at very
highenergy scales, this suggests matching the lowest order coming from the perturbation
theory of (4.3) with the smatrix (1.1), both computed in their highenergy limit. in
this kinematical regime the two particles involved in the scattering can be eectively seen
as left and right movers. their momenta p and q may be parameterised in terms of a
new rapidity variable  as p = me1, q = me2, so that the mandelstam variable s is
expressed in this limit as s = 2m2e12. the lowest order in g of the scattering amplitude
in this regime may be computed as in [20] with the result

s(s)  1 + 2ig

s
m2 +   

(4.4)

let us now compare this expression with the one from the expansion of the smatrix
(1.1) around the point 12 = . by setting 1/ sinh 12  e12 as a parameterization
around 12 = , the smatrix (1.1) may be written in the vicinity of this point as

s(12) =

s + i m2
sin a
s  i m2

sin a

 1 + 2i sin a

s
m2 +   

so that we have the identication

g  sin a  a

(4.5)

(4.6)

i.e. g is a positive quantity. it is important to note that the sign of the above coupling
constant is opposite of the one relative to the roaming model nearby the ising xed point
[20]. this dierence in the sign of the coupling relative to the rst irrelevant operator
seems therefore responsible for the quite distinct ultraviolet behaviour of the two theories:
the roaming model has in fact a smooth ultraviolet behaviour controlled by the nearest
tricritical ising point (with central charge c = 7
10 ) whereas the qft associated to our
bosonic smatrix develops instead an ultraviolet instability. this situation evidently
resembles the two dierent behaviours which originate from the change of sign in the
example of footnote 5.

let us nally add a few comments on the full hamiltonian of the theory. as discussed
in section 2, the action (4.3) will also contain higher derivative terms n  n , so

17

that in general we can write

g

the adimensional constants an can be in principle determined by the integrability con-
dition of the theory, i.e. by matching the expansion of the smatrix in power of s/m2
with the feynman graphs which originate from (4.8). for the presence of the innite
higher derivative terms in the action, the corresponding hamiltonian (with respect to the
ising xed point) will be then a nonlocal one. in the majorana basis12 denoted as before

kernel v (z), (z = mz), as

by(cid:0)(x, t), (x, t)(cid:1), it is convenient to write the hamiltonian in terms of a dimensionless
h =z :(cid:2)ix + i x  + 2im (cid:3) : dx+gm2z z :  : (x)v (xy) :  : (y)dxdy

(4.8)
in such way that the coupling constants of the higher derivative terms are nothing but
the higher moments of v (z). therefore, once the coecients an were known, the kernel
v (z) can be recovered in terms of an inverse mellin transformation. the advantage
of expressing the hamiltonian in this way is twofold. first of all, it shows that the
hamiltonian is actually renormalisable albeit obviously nonlocal. secondly, it provides
an easy argument to show that the nonlocal term is the one responsable for the instability

of the theory. this argument is based on the simple hypothesis that r v (z)dz > 0. let
us consider in fact the hamiltonian (4.8) in the hartreefock approximation and let us
dene an order parameter  = ih:  :i. for eld congurations which do not vary on
x, the value of the hamiltonian (4.8) for unit volume is given by

h
l

= m  gv2 ,

(4.9)

where v = r v (z)dz > 0. when g = 0, we can always subtract from h/l an innite

constant (due to the dirac sea of the fermion) such that we can restrict to the positive
values of  and the minimum of h/l is therefore obtained for  = 0. this subtraction
is equivalent to a selection of the vacuum state for the free theory. however, when we
switch on a positive value of g, the quantity h/l becomes once again unbounded from
below, so that there would be an instability of the vacuum originally selected by the free
theory. hence the above hypothesis permits to understand in an easy way the nature of
the problem posed by our bosonic smatrix, i.e. the instability of the vacuum state of
the underlying microscopic hamiltonian.

5 conclusions

in this paper we have discussed the physical properties of the simplest bosonictype s
matrix with the aim to clarify the nature of its pathological behaviour, in particular at
its shortdistance scales. the tba approach has shown that the diculties consist in an
instability of the vacuum state of the theory which occurs at a certain distance or energy
scale, i.e. in the failure of the usual saddle point approach to minimise the freeenergy.
this quantity in fact for r < rc becomes in our case unbounded from below. even in
the absence of the above method, the peculiar physical behaviour of the qft associated
to a bosonic smatrix may be inferred by the computation of its form factors. we have
seen in fact that even with some stringent constraints imposed on the matrix elements
they are intrinsically largely undetermined. moreover, the spectral series which originate
from them are generically divergent.

even after the thorough analysis of this paper, one could be still surprised that an
innocent 1 in front of an smatrix is the source of all the pathological features of
the qft associated to such an smatrix. the fact is that the smatrix, even for the
integrable models where it takes a particularly simple form, is still the nal result of an
innite resummation of all microscopic processes dictated by an hamiltonian. therefore
while it is in general relatively simple to decide whether or not an hamiltonian may
give rise to a consistent quantum theory  in terms of stability of the vacuum and the
relative excitations thereof  (once again, the simple example of footnote 5 is particularly
instructive), the model analysed in this paper shows on the contrary that it may be
in general algorithmically dicult to trace all this information back and to infer the
consistency of a theory starting from the end, i.e.
from the knowledge alone of the
smatrix.

several questions arise in relation to the observations of the previous sections. for
instance, it would be interesting to analyse the qft associated to more general cdd
factors and characterise those which have a smooth interpolation from the short to the
large distance scales, i.e. those ones which identify consistent qft. moreover, actions
which are initially obtained by a perturbation of irrelevant elds contain an innite series
of corrections due to the higher dimension operators and hence they are generally non
local. in this respect, it would be useful to develop a powerful method for determining
in an ecient way all the coupling constants of these operators and to have a criterion
to identify those nonlocal theories which give rise to integrable models.

appendix a

let us consider the calculation of the freeenergy of a bosonic type smatrix with a
kernel () given by

i.e. with a phaseshift dened by

() = 2() ,

 i ln s() =


 if  < 0
0
if  = 0
+ if  > 0

in virtue of the locality of the kernel (a.1), the total density of levels () is simply
related to the root density of levels by

where

() = a() + (r)() ,

a() 

m
2

cosh  .

the functional of the freeenergy (at zero chemical potential) is given by

(a.1)

(a.2)

(a.3)

(a.4)

(a.5)

(a.6)

(a.7)

where

and

1
f (, (r)) = e((r)) 
rs(, (r))
e((r)) =z m cosh  (r)() d ,

s(, (r)) =z d(cid:2)( + (r)) log( + (r))   log   (r) log (r)(cid:3) .

by plugging the expression (a.3) for () into eq.(a.5) and minimizing with respect
to the distribution (r)(), we have the following condition for the density (r) which
minimizes the functional (a.5)

where

(cid:0)a + 2(r)(cid:1)2
(r) (a + 2(r))2 = c ,

c = emr cosh  .

(a.8)

(a.9)

for any value of a, the left hand side of eq.(a.8) as a function of the positive values of
(r) is always larger than 4. hence a positive real solution does not exist for all values of
r but only for those for which it is veried the condition c  4. in this case the solution
is given by

(r)() =

a

2"r c

c  4  1# .

21

(a.10)

correspondingly

() =

a

2"r c
c  4

+ 1# .

(a.11)

substituing these expressions into (a.5), the value of the functional at its minimum is
given by

f (r) = mz cosh  ln(cid:20) 1

2(cid:16)1 +p1  4emr cosh (cid:17)(cid:21) .

hence, within the saddle point solution of the tba equation we have

e0(r) =

g(mr) ,

(a.13)

(a.14)

where

this expression becomes complex for r  rc = ln 4
m . rc is the value where the rst
instability of the functional (a.5) shows up, due to the distribution modes (0)() and
() computed at  = 0 (for r < rc additional instabilities are induced by other modes).
to see this, rst of all notice that, in view of the algebraic equation (a.3), we have a
complete decoupling of the contributions due to dierent  in the free energy. let us
consider then the term f 0 in (a.5) due to the two distributions computed at  = 0. by
using eq.(a.3), with the notation   (r)(0) and a0  m

2 we have

f 0(, r) =  

1
r

[(a0 + 2) ln(a0 + 2)  (a0 + ) ln(a0 + )   ln ]

.

(a.15)

this expression, as a function of , is plotted in figure 6 for r > rc, r = rc and
r < rc respectively. for r > rc f 0 admits a minimum for a positive real value of 
and the function is asymptotically positive. hence for these range of r the saddlepoint
approximation results valid. at r = rc the minimum has moved at innity although the
value of the function f 0 has remained nite. for r < rc the function f 0 does not have
any longer a minimum and its values are unbounded from below, causing an instability
in the corresponding free energy.

figure 1 . renormalization group ow which passes by a xed point along the direc-

tions of the irrelevant and relevant elds  and .

figure 2.a . plots of the central charge c(mr) =  6r

 f (mr) for the mshg model at
a particular value of a, for the thermal ising model and for a free bosonic model.
below mrc (mrc  1 in the gure), the central charge of the mshg model assumes
complex values.

figure 3 . proles of the pseudoenergy  versus  for dierent values of r. rc corre-

sponds to the value when this function hits the origin.

figure 4 . twoparticle contribution to the ctheorem versus the parameter a of the

smatrix.

figure 5 . graph of f (a)

2 sin a versus a.

figure 6.a the freeenergy as a function of (r)(0) for r > rc, when there is a minimum.

figure 6.b the freeenergy as a function of (r)(0) for r = rc. the minimum has

moved at innity.

figure 6.c . the freeenergy as a function of (r)(0) for r < rc when there is no longer

a minimum.
