we study discrete uxes in four dimensional su (n ) gauge theories with a mass gap

by using brane compactications which give n = 1 or n = 0 supersymmetry. we show

that when such theories are compactied further on a torus, the thooft magnetic ux m
is related to the ns two-form modulus b by b = 2 m
n . these values of b label degenerate
brane vacua, giving a simple demonstration of magnetic screening. furthermore, for these

values of b one has a conventional gauge theory on a commutative torus, without having

to perform any t-dualities. because of the mass gap, a generic b does not give a four

dimensional gauge theory on a non-commutative torus. the kaluza-klein modes which
must be integrated out to give a four dimensional theory decouple only when b = 2 m
n .
finally we show that 2 m
n behaves like a two form modulus of the qcd string. this
conrms a previous conjecture based on properties of large n qcd suggesting a t-duality

invariance.

1.

introduction

recently, an improved understanding of the infrared properties of qcd has been

gained by studying classical congurations of m theory. in [1][2][3], a theory in the same

universality class as four dimensional n = 1 qcd, known as mqcd, was studied by

wrapping an m theory vebrane on a holomorphic curve  embedded in the spacetime
r10  s1. n = 0 mqcd was also constructed in [1] by taking  to be a non-holomorphic

two-cycle of minimal area. the results of this paper are applicable to either case. we

will further compactify the theory on a torus of nite size, so that the m-vebrane wraps
  t 2 which is embedded in r8  t 2  s1.

in the absence of fundamental matter,

su (n ) qcd on a two-torus has a discrete magnetic ux m which is dened modulo n [4].

the supergravity quantities corresponding to discrete yang-mills uxes in the ads/cft

approach [5][6][7][8] were discussed in [9]. in that context, the discrete uxes appeared as

states in a topological eld theory. in the present context, we will see that the t hooft

ux corresponds to the background m-theory three-form through the relation

zt 2s1

c = 2

m
n

.

(1.1)

since this result is independent of the radius of the s1, we expect it to persist in the iia

limit, giving

b = zt 2

bn s = 2

m
n

.

(1.2)

this relation is peculiar to the case in which there is a mass gap. the background

three-form is of course not really discretely quantized. the vacuum energy of the ve-

n . at
these minima, there exists a limit in which the low energy theory is qcd, with t hooft

brane has a periodic dependance on this background, with minima at r c = 2 m
ux m. for other values of r c, one might naively expect to nd a gauge theory on a
non-commutative torus, [10][11] but this is not the case. we will show that for r c away

from the minima, it is impossible to decouple the kaluza klein modes on .

interest-

ingly, the absence of a noncommutative deformation is consistent with arguments that the

small instanton singularity plays an important role in qcd dynamics [12]. yang-mills

theories on non-commutative tori do not have a small instanton singularity[13][14]. for 

corresponding to a theory with a mass gap, the small instanton singularity exists precisely
n , with m being the t hooft ux. if one instead considered a curve 
giving an n = 2 super yang-mills theory, a small instanton singularity would only exist

when r c = 2 m

1

if r c = 2m, which is gauge equivalent to r c = 0. furthermore, for  giving n = 2
super yang-mills theory, one can decouple the kaluza-klein modes for all values of r c.

at low energies, we expect a continuous class of four dimensional yang-mills theories on

a noncommutative torus. the dierence between the case with a mass gap and the case

without is related to whether or not there is a u (1) gauge eld at low energies. note that

the non-commutative star product exists for u (n ) theories, but not for su (n ).

the relation (1.1) is a very simple illustration of magnetic screening.

t hooft has

shown that in an electrically conning su (n )/zn theory with a mass gap, magnetic uxes

must be light [4]. more precisely, the energy of a magnetic ux must vanish exponentially

with the area of the torus. this is simply realized in the m-theory construction. because

of (1.1), the t hooft ux is not the central charge associated with a membrane. in fact, the

dierent magnetic uxes correspond to classically degenerate m-vebrane congurations.

this result diers drastically from what one would obtain by considering a compactication

of the m-vebrane giving n = 2 super yang-mills theory. in that case the magnetic ux

is related to an additive central charge, rather than an element of zn labeling degenerate

congurations.

we will also argue that 2 m

n behaves like a two-form modulus of the qcd string as
well as the iia string. this means that the imaginary part of the action of an mqcd

string wrapping the two-torus n times is given by nrt 3 c. again, we expect this result
to persist in the iia limit, so that the imaginary part of the action of a wrapped qcd
string is given by 2n m
n . in the large n limit, this becomes a continuous quantity. such
a relation has been shown explicitly in two dimensions in the large n limit [15][16][17]. it

was also conjectured to be true in four dimensions on the basis of properties of large n

qcd suggesting a t-duality invariance. such a duality would map,

where  is the kahler modulus,

a is the area of the torus, and 2 is the qcd string tension.

an argument due to t hooft states that in an electrically conning su (n )/zn theory

with a mass gap, magnetic uxes must be light [4]. more precisely, the energy of a magnetic

ux must vanish exponentially with the area of the torus. this is simply realized in the

m-theory construction. because of (1.1), the t hooft ux is not the central charge for

2

a membrane. in fact, when there is a mass gap, dierent magnetic uxes correspond to

classically degenerate m-vebrane congurations. this result diers drastically from what

one would obtain by considering a compactication of the m-vebrane giving n = 2 super

yang-mills theory. in that case the magnetic ux is related to an additive central charge,

rather than an element of zn labeling degenerate congurations.

in the iia limit, the m-vebrane wrapped on  becomes a conguration of n d4-

branes suspended between ns vebranes. for congurations giving n = 2 super yang-

mills on a commutative torus, the d4-brane worldvolume may also contain integral num-

bers of fundamental strings, d2 branes and d0 branes [18]. however for congurations

giving qcd-like theories with a mass gap, the allowed charges are more exotic. there can

be no d2 branes or fundamental iia strings in the low energy theory. this reects the fact

that both the magnetic and electric uxes in qcd are elements of zn rather than additive

central charges. however there may be euclidean d0-branes with fractional charge. when
the theory is fully compactied on   t 4, the d0 brane charge has a fractional part of
the form 1
n m  m. this naively appears to violate dirac quantization in the presence of
a single d6 brane. however, due to the nonzero b = 2 m
n , additional charges are induced

on the d6-brane which preserve the dirac quantization condition.

the organization of this paper is as follows. in section ii we briey review the construc-

tion of four dimensional gauge theories by wrapping m-vebranes on calibrated two-cycles.

in section iii we perform an additional compactication on a two-torus, allowing a three

form modulus in m-theory, and show how this modulus is related to the t hooft ux when

the theory has a mass gap. in section iv we show how the t hooft ux behaves like a

two-form modulus for the qcd string on a torus. in section v we discuss the unusual

d-brane charges allowed when there is a mass gap.

2. m-vebranes and qcd

a variety of four dimensional yang-mills theories may be obtained by wrapping an
m vebrane on calibrated two cycles embedded in s1  r10[19][1]. here we consider two-

cycles corresponding to an su(n) yang-mills theory with a mass gap. for instance a

theory in the same universality class as n = 1 su (n ) yang-mills is obtained by wrapping

the ve-brane on a particular holomorphic curve embedded in three complex dimensions.

for details of this curve, the reader is referred to [1][3][2]. this theory becomes exactly
n = 1, su (n ) yang mills in the weakly coupled iia limit in which the radius of the s1

3

goes to zero in eleven dimensional planck units. while taking this limit, the parameters

of the curve are adjusted to keep the qcd scale xed. at the same time one takes the
limit qcdl11
is the eleven dimensional planck length. we will begin by
studying the m theory limit in which the radius of the s1 is large. however the quantities

p  0 where l11

p

which we will compute are discrete and independent of the radius. for our purposes the

degree of supersymmetry is unimportant so long as there is a mass gap. our results are

be equally applicable to the theory in the same universality class as pure n = 0 qcd [1]

which is obtained from a non-holomorphic but minimal area two cycle.

we will make use of two essential properties of two-cycles  corresponding to su (n )

yang-mills theories with a mass gap. the rst property is that h1(, z) is generated by a
cycle s1 wrapping the s1 of space-time n times [1][3]. the second property is that there

are no square integrable harmonic one-forms on . a compactication of  obtained by

adding points at innity gives a curve of genus zero [1]. because of the latter property,

there are no light states after dimensional reduction. at low energies, the only solution of

the equations of motion for the self dual three-form eld strength of the m5-brane is

t (3) = db(2)  c(3)|m 5 = 0,

(2.1)

where b(2) is the two-form gauge potential of the m-vebrane, and c(3)|m 5 is the pullback
of the bulk three-form potential to the m-vebrane. note that if we instead considered a

curve  giving n = 2 super yang-mills theory, then there would be normalizable harmonic

one forms associated with massless u (1) vector multiplets in the low energy theory [19].

if the m-vebrane worldvolume x has a non-trivial h3(x, z), there may be several vacua
corresponding to solutions of (2.1). we assume that the background c(3) is at, so dc(3) =

0. we will see that these vacua are discrete.

3. three-form moduli and t hooft uxes

let us now compactify m theory on s1  t 2  r8, and wrap an m-vebrane on
  t 2  r2. the low energy theory is an su(n) yang-mills theory on t 2  r2 with a
mass gap. the m-vebrane worldvolume now has non-trivial three cycle s1  t 2. since
the m5 brane theory contains strings coupling to b(2), there is a ux quantization condition

zs1t 2

db(2) = 2m,

4

(3.1)

where m is an integer. then because t (3) = 0,

zs1t 2

c(3)|m 5 = 2m.

since s1 wraps n times around s1, the bulk three-form modulus is given by

zs1t 2

c(3) = 2

m
n

.

(3.2)

(3.3)

in order to get solutions for other values of r c(3), one must expand t (3) in the

kaluza klein modes on . note that in general  will change in the presence of a non-zero
t 3, however the property that there are no normalizable harmonic one-forms persists. in

this case we do not expect varying r c(3) to give a continuous class of four dimensional

yang-mill theories on non-commutative tori.

we will now argue that the the integer m is the t hooft ux. to do so we will work in

the iia limit. in this limit the m5-brane becomes a set of n coincident d4-branes stretched

between ns5-branes. in the absence of the n s5-branes, the low energy theory would have

a u (n ) gauge group. however in our case there is a mass gap, and the theory is su (n ).
1
n trf  bn s = 0. this follows from dimensional
the u (1) degree of freedom is frozen:
reduction of t (3) = 0. if the d4-brane is compactied on a torus, then elds on the torus
are periodic up to gauge transformations u 1 and u 2. these gauge transformations are

subject to a consistency condition [20],

u 1(x1, x2)u 2(x1 + 2r1, x2)u 1(x1 + 2r1, x2 + 2r2)u 2(x1, x2 + 2r2) = i,

(3.4)

this condition permits the existence of fundamental matter, which appears when strings

end on the d4 branes. note that (3.1) follows from an analogous condition. the u s may

be broken up into a u (1) factor and an su (n ) factor, so that the above condition becomes

eirt 2

1

n t rf e2i m

n = i,

(3.5)

where m is the su (n ) t hooft ux. since 1

n trf = bn s, we nd the t hooft ux is
precisely the discrete quantum number discovered in the m-theory approach. the fact

that the t hooft ux is only dened modulo n is reected in the fact that 2 shifts in

r bn s are gauge transformations. thus the t hooft uxes are associated with degenerate
classical vacua of the m5-brane, all of which have t (3) = 0. this demonstrates magnetic

5

screening and is precisely what one expects for for an electrically conning theory with a

mass gap [4].

the constraint fu(1)  b = 0 arising from the existence of a mass gap means that the
theory is a standard gauge theory on a commutative torus. in [21][22][23] this quantity

was argued to be a local measure of non-commutativity on the brane worldvolume. a

simple way to see that the small instanton singularity is not resolved is to perform a t-

duality along one of the cycles of the torus. the b eld then becomes the real part of

the complex structure of the dual torus. the n d4-branes become a d3-brane at an
angle determined by 1
n t rf . consider wrapping a euclidean d1-brane on the cycle of the
torus on which the t-duality is performed. because of the relation b = 2 m
n relating the
real part of the complex structure to the angle of the d3-branes, the d1-brane is at a 90

degree angle to the d3-brane, giving a bps conguration. there is a coulomb branch

describing motion relative to the d3-branes. the d1 can be placed such that it intersects

the d3-branes. then upon undoing the t-duality, the d1-brane becomes a euclidean d0-

brane corresponding to a small instanton. it has been argued [12] that the small instanton

singularity plays an important role in qcd dynamics. our result supports this claim,

since a non-commutative deformation does not exist when there is a mass gap. note that

this is related to the freezing of the u (1) degree of freedom. a non-commutative star

product does not exist when this degree of freedom is frozen. in u (n ) gauge theories on

a non-commutative torus, gauge transformations mix the su (n ) and u (1) components.

it is interesting to note that in the n   limit of a of the theory with with a mass

gap, one is allowed a continuous range of values for b, all of which correspond to a gauge

theory on a commutative torus.

4. b eld for the qcd string

it has long been suspected that large n qcd is a string theory. we now wish to

prove the conjecture [16][17] that the t hooft ux behaves like the real part of a two-form

modulus of the qcd-string. to do so we will show that the euclidean action of a qcd
string wrapping t 2 n times has an imaginary part given by 2n m
n let us rst compute
the imaginary part of the action of a wrapped mqcd string. the mqcd string [1] is an

open membrane ending on the m5-brane. the worlvolume of the mqcd string is i  m,

where m is the world sheet of the qcd string and i is an open interval generating the

relative homology h1(y /, zn ). y is the space in which  is embedded. for a detailed

6

discussion of the mqcd string, the reader is referred to [1][2]. the action of the open

m-twobrane has an imaginary piece:

ims = zim

c(3)|m 2 zim

b(2),

(4.1)

where c(3)|m 2 is the pullback of the bulk three-form to the membrane, and b(2) is the two-
form of the m-vebrane world volume. the second term is necessary for gauge invariance
of the open membrane action. under c(3)  c(3) + d(2), b(2) transforms to cancel the the
non-invariance due to the boundary: b(2)  b(2) + (2)|m 2. because db(2)  c(3)|m 5 = 0,
we may rewrite (4.1) as

ims = z(i)m

c(3),

(4.2)

where  is a chain in the m5-brane with boundary i m. the mqcd string is homotopic
to the iia string, which is a membrane with the world volume s1  m [1]. therefore the

above expression becomes

so if m wraps t 2 n times,

ims = zs1m

c(3).

ims = 2n

m
n

.

(4.3)

(4.4)

this result is discrete and independent of the radius of the s1, so we expect it to hold in
the iia limit. in the large n limit 2m
n becomes continuous, and behaves as the two-form

modulus for the qcd-string, as well as the iia string.

5. d-brane charges in theories with a mass gap

the allowed d-brane charges in theories with a mass gap dier substantially from

those without a mass gap. if we had considered a brane construction of an n = 2 theory

instead, the d2 brane charge and the fundamental string charge would equal the magnetic

and electric uxes respectively. however the uxes in qcd are very dierent objects. the

term in the m5-brane action of the form s = r c(3)  db(2) vanishes in mqcd because

db(2)  c(3) = 0. due to the self duality of db(2)  c(3) = 0, this term becomes

s = z c(3)

rr  t r(f  b) +z bn s  t r(f  b),

(5.1)

in the iia limit. this vanishes, so there are no states in the low energy theory carrying

either d2 brane or fundamental string charge.

7

in brane constructions of qcd, the euclidean d0-brane charge may be fractional.

the importance of such fractional charges for connement and dynamical generation of

superpotentials has been discussed in [12]. we will show that the such fractional charges

are consistent with dirac quantization in the presence of a d6-brane. the chern-simons

term in the d4 brane action which determines whether there is also d0-brane charge is

given by [18]

z c(1)

rr  t r [(f  b)  (f  b)]

(5.2)

since t r(f  b) = 0, the d0-brane charge is given by the su (n )/zn contribution to the
instanton number, which may be fractional [24]. if one compacties su (n )/zn qcd on
t 4, then the instanton number is given by

1

162 z f  f =  +

m  m

n

,

(5.3)

where  is an integer and m are the integer t hooft uxes. the fractional piece apparently
violates dirac quantization in the presence of a single d6-brane, since q6q
0 is not an
integer multiple of 2. if a d6-brane is present then the theory on the d4 brane contains

massive fundamental matter due to string stretched between the d6-brane and the d4-

brane. since fundamentals of su (n ) are charged under the zn center, it would naively

seem that t hooft ux must vanish modulo n and the instanton number must be integer.

however the matter introduced by the d6-brane is in a fundamental representation of

u (n ), and a nontrivial su (n ) t hooft twist may be cancelled by a u (1) twist, as in

(3.4). the introduction of fundamental matter by a d6-brane does not prohibit non-trivial

t hooft uxes or fractional d0-brane charge.

the dirac quantization problem is resolved as follows. when the t hooft ux is

non-zero, there is also a background r b given by the relation (1.2). for non-zero r b

a d6-brane carries other d-brane charges [18]. the non-integer terms which threaten to

violate dirac quantization turn out to cancel just as they would for a pair of dyons in the

presence of a non-zero theta parameter. suppose that the d4 brane on which the yang-

mills theory lives is extended in the directions 01234, with the directions 0123 compactied
on t 4. the d4-brane is bounded by ns-5 branes at xed values of x4. consider the action
of a d6-brane with the world-volume t 4  s3, where s3 is embedded in the directions
56789. also, suppose that the d6-brane is at a value of x4 between the ns5-branes and
does not intersect the d4-d0 system. the path integral for the d6 brane contains a term

i(cid:16)rt 4s3

e

c(7)

rr bb

42 rs3

c(3)

rr(cid:17),

(5.4)

8

the second term reects the fact that in the presence of b, a d2-brane charge is induced

on the d6-brane. a d4-brane charge is induced as well, however the corresponding term

in the action does not eect dirac quantization. this is because the the d4-brane is hodge

dual to a d2-brane, and the d2-brane charge vanishes on the d4-brane associated with the
yang-mills theory. because of the d4-d0 system, the ramond-ramond potentials c(7)
and c(3)

rr are not globally dened. for (5.4) to be well dened, one must have

rr

i(cid:16)rt 4s4

e

dc(7)

rr  bb

42 rs4

dc(3)

rr(cid:17) = 1,

(5.5)

where s4 is embedded in the directions 56789 and surrounds the d4-d0 system, which
is a point in 56789. r dc(7) is simply the d0-brane charge, with fractional piece mm
n .
similarly r dc(3) is the d4-brane charge, or n. since b = 2 m
n , equation (5.5) is satised.

roughly speaking, we have found that

q(0)  q(6) + q(2)  q(4)  q(4)  q(2) = 2l,

(5.6)

where the q charges are associated with the d6-brane, and the q charges are associated

with the d4-branes.
