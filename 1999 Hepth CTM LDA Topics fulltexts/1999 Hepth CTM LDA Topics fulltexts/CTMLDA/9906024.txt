(2.13) ln = 1 2 : xm nm : sense ordering operation (2.14) dened method quantization. lets write also expressions momentum angular momentum string: p = z 0 , j = z 0 (x x ) help (2.6) (2.7) directly verify,  = 0 ,  = 0 means, momentum angular momentum string conserved. standard quantization ground state | 0 satises conditions | 0 = 0 , complete space states orthogonal basis: 0 m1 . . . 1 ms | 0 , mi < 0 (2.13) (2.14) (2.15) (2.16) (2.17) thus, linear operators complete space states. (2.9) (2.16) follows, metrics space states (2.17) indenite. ordering (2.14) means, operators n n 0. ordering results virasoro algebra contains anomalies: < 0 placed left operators  = (n m) ln+m + 1 12 d(n3 n) (2.18) dimension x - space. case = 2 . therefore annihilation operators ln n 0 maximum, reached. result theory self-consistent = 26. detailed study problems, arising quantization (2.16), found . shall state way quantization two-dimensional string, results self- consistent string theory . quantization method string similar quantization method applied dirac electromagnetic eld (see. , also appendix). lets introduce designations (2.9) obtain: x = x0 x1 ,  =  = 0 , () = 0 1  = 0 ,  = 2i n ,  =  = 2m m+n n ] = 0 , n ] = 2i n lets write virasoro operators variables (): ln = 1 2 xm (+) nm () (2.19) (2.20) (2.21) denition ordering (2.21) means either elements (+) arranged left elements () elements () arranged left elements (+). orderings equivalent. indeed xm () ( m) (+) = xm () (+) ( m) + 2 xm , possible consider last sum equal zero, since represented form (1) (1), (s) rieman zeta-function. known zeta-function (s) xn=1 ns (2.22) unique analytical continuation point = 1 (1) = 1/12. variables system act linear operators. following problem consists denition vector space states, dynamic beginning apply dirac prescription quantization model, marking chosen way index d. represent complete space states hcd tensor product gauge space states hg physical space states hp d: hcd = hg hp (2.23) space hg generated vacuum vector properties: 0 | 0; gi = 0 , 1 | 0; gi = 0 , > 0 , | 0; gi, determined following (2.24) h 0; g| 0; gi = 1 basis space hg consists vectors form thus, hg fock space positively dened scalar product. m1 . . . 0 0 ms 1 n1 . . . 1 nr | 0; gi , mi > 0 , ni > 0 (2.25) basis dirac physical space states hp consists two series | k id following properties ( () 0 p ): p+ | k id = 2k | k id , () | k id = 0 , (+) p | k+ id = 2k | k+ id , | k+ id = 0 , = 0, 1, . . . (2.26) (2.27) (2.28) k continuous real parameter, 0 < k < +. quantization conditions (2.27) applied works . earlier similar quantization conditions applied dirac electrodynamics . given denitions seen, complete space states scalar product positively h k | k id = k (k k ) , h k | k+ id = 0 dened. lets emphasize, variables n , n 6= 0, linear operators space hg, operators vectors | k+ id, also action vectors | k id dened, n 6= 0. nevertheless given denitions n space hp d. indeed, action variables () variables (+) follows, action combinations (generally speaking, nonlinear) variables n 6= 0 space hp determined correctly. example, owing (2.20) (2.27), have: n n () (+) | k+ id = 2m| k+id , () (+) | k id = 2m| k id since ln = 1 2 xm (+) nm () = 1 2 xm () nm (+) , consequence (2.27) equalities ln | p id = 0 , | p id hp (2.29) (2.30) take place. thus, physical states annihilated virasoro operators. equalities (2.30) mean, quantization (2.24) - (2.28) virasoro algebra anomaly.  = (n m) ln+m (2.31) situation, common degenerated systems. degenerated systems set rst class constraints m. evident resolution constraints inexpedient, according dirac prescription following conditions | p id = 0 (2.32) imposed physical states. obvious, owing (2.32) physical states depend gauge degrees freedom, changes generated constraints m. thus variables, describing gauge degrees freedom , generally speaking, linear operators space physical states. hand, according dirac prescription necessary consider physical states. lets consider example investigated model paradox arise dirac procedure realized. set oscillator variables , 6= 0, also coordinate momentum variables (x, p ). schrodinger quantization complete space states hc decomposed tensor product spaces hg hp : hc = hg hp . space hg (2.24) - (2.25). space hp schrodinger representation is, example, space functions two variables (x0, x1 ), positively determined lorentz - invariant scalar product. denition space hp states annihilated operators () , 6= 0. moreover, also complete space hc states annihilated operators () , 6= 0. one add space hg states | i, operators () equal zero. extended space shall dene scalar product follows: h | = 1 , h + | = 0 , dene h | gi = 0 , | gi hg | k id = | | k , (2.33) | k hp , p | k = 2k | k set vectors { | k id} form basis space hp d. lets pay attention reason parameter k (2.27), (2.28) (2.34) positive. follows requirement positivity scalar product space hp . indeed, space hp space states massless bose-particle. well known (see , chapter 3, 2) space positively dened lorentz - invariant scalar product exists positive (or negative) energies. (2.34) thus, dirac prescription imply variables normalizable space hc . space hc initial variables bose creation annihilation operators. consideration seen, vector space hp belong initial , 6= 0 well dened 6= 0 operators physical space hp d. variables { , x } generators associative noncommutative m, x } satisfy involutive algebra unit complex numbers (see ). generators { relations (2.9). generators {x, p } operators space physical states hp d. space hp basis | k id, relations (2.27) take place. 6= 0 operators space physical states. nevertheless, observable quantities depend variables so, matrix elements observable quantities relative vectors space physical states determined correctly. situation place quantum electrodynamics dirac quantization  (see also appendix). variables lets continue study model. denitions (2.15) obtain following formulae: (exp j 01) () (expi j 01) = (exp) () , (exp j 01) x (expi j 01) = (exp) x arbitrary real numbers. evident eqs. (2.29) (2.30) translations lorentz transformations conserve condition (2.23). according eq. (2.35) p (expi j 01) = (exp ) (expi j 01) p (2.37) let us formally act equalities (2.37) states |ki, accordingly. result eq. (2.26) obtain (2.39) last equality makes possible determine action operators (expij 01) physical states follows: p (expi j 01)| k = 2k e (expi j 01)| k (expi j 01)| k = f | (exp j 01)| k f dened lorentz-invariant manner according (2.28) |f one assume complex numbers dierent zero. since scalar product physical state vectors | = 1. eq. (2.39) evident (2.40) k > 0 according eqs. (2.8) (2.15) l p = 0 = 2 l {( 0 + 1 ) p+ + ( 0 1 ) p} (exp iap ) x (expiap ) = x + l (expiap ) = () (exp iap ) () (2.35) (2.36) therefore (2.26) (2.27) obtain: l p | k id = k | k id , k = (k, k) (2.41) thus, result above-described quantization procedure two-dimensional string arises system similar massless quantum particle two-dimensional space-time. 3. way anomaly-free quantization two-dimensional string. previous section emphasized diculties arise dirac quantization degenerated systems. diculties general reduced following problems: 1) problem normalizability physical state vectors. 2) impossibility interpretation initial dynamic variables linear operators space physical states. problems successfully solved relatively simple models electrodynamics two- dimensional string. however, complete solution problems complicated models four dimensional gravity extremely dicult. propose section alternative way quantization two-dimensional string. idea quantization consists weakening dirac conditions (2.32) replacement conditions: h p | | p ig = 0 (3.1) index p number physical state. index g indicates averaging (3.1) goes gauge degrees freedom. quantization conditions (3.1) similar sense a) gupta-bleuler conditions electrodynamics, equality = 0 takes place sense mean value; b) quantization conditions usual string theory, generators virasoro algebra satisfy conditions ln = 0 also sense mean value. important calculation mean value (3.1) performed relative physical states. dierence oered quantization gupta-bleuler standard string quantizations approach scalar product complete space states positively dened. shown below, fact allows carry anomaly-free quantization two-dimensional string. insted dirac selfconsistency conditions  = cl mn l , have: h p | | p ig = 0 (3.2) explain physical sense conditions (3.2). known hamiltonian generally covariant system form ht = p vmm. assume, moment time conditions (3.1) take place. innitely close moment time + constraint n equal n(t + t) = n(t) + xm vm (t) thus selfconsistency conditions (3.2) provide equalities (3.1) moment time. believe, complete space states, initial dynamic variables (2.9) - (2.10) act, space hc , determined previous section: hc = hg hp (3.3) spaces hg hp dened according (2.24), (2.25) (2.34). let space hp basis | k = | k0, k1 such, p | k = k | k (3.4) calculations necessary dene suitable ordering operators. next shall use ordering l0 = 1 2 p p xm>0 (0 0 1 1 ) , (3.5) equivalent ordering (2.21). think examined model convenient physical states satisfying conditions (3.1), states, coherent relative gauge degrees freedom. lets consider space hg coherent state | z; gi = ym>0 exp(cid:26)| z0 |2 + | z1 |2 2m + 1 (z0 0 + z1 1 (cid:27) | 0; gi (3.6) z 0 = k z bar means complex conjugation. consequence (2.9) (2.24) have: , 6= 0 complex numbers. assume denition z = z m. h z; g| z; gi = 1 , 0 | z; gi = z0 1 | z; gi = z1 lets introduce designation | z state | z; gi , | z; gi , > 0 (3.4), (3.7) (3.8) follows, | z = | z; gi | k hc (3.7) (3.8) 0 | z = z0 call set complex numbers { z designated | z ip , parameters satisfy equations: | z , 1 } parameters state | z i. state called physical | z , 0 | z = z1 (3.9) put z() n = z0 n z1 n ln(z) 1 2 xm z nm zm = 0 z()() = ein z() n , 1 2 xn ein ln = (3.10) (3.10) (3.11) l() = 1 2 xn 1 2 z(+)() z()() functions z()() real. equations (3.10) equivalent following one: l() = impose also gauge invariant conditions 1 2 z(+)() z()() = 0 z(+) 0 z() 0 k k = 0 supposed, solutions equations (3.10) satisfy condition (3.11). therefore basis space hp given according (2.34), scalar product according (2.28). formulas (3.5), (3.9), (3.10) follows immediately, considered case conditions (3.1) take place: lets verify selfconsistency condition (3.2). case purpose enough check up, h z | ln | z ip = 0 (3.12) simple calculation shows: h z | ( lnln lnln )| z ip = 0 (3.13) lnln = 1 2 n xm=1 m(n ) + n (1 0 )2 + 2n n xm=1 1 m1 m+ + xm=n+1 similarly: (n + m) 1 m1 + xm=n+1 (m n) 0 m0 m+ : lnln : 1 2 n1 xm=1 lnln = m(n ) + n (0 0 )2 + 2n n xm=1 0 m0 m+ (n + m) 0 m0 + xm=n+1 (m n) 1 m1 m+ : lnln : two last equalities obtain: + xm=n+1 since : lnln :: lnln : lnln lnln = 2n l0 , (3.14) (3.15) (3.16) ordering right hand side eq.(3.16) given according (3.5). (3.16) seen, equalities (3.12) take place, selfconsistency conditions (3.2) valid. note that, generally speaking, let hamiltonian system ht = pn vn ln, vn( ) = vn( ). give answer question mean values heisenberg variables change time. heisenberg equations look like h z | lnln || z ip 6= 0 = xn vn m+n , x = xn vn n dene following equations system complex time-dependent numbers: m( )  = h z | z m( )| z ip , (3.17) (3.18) m( ) heisenberg variables. eq.(3.18) assume collections parameters 0 = z {z} {z} physical, satisfy equations (3.10). moreover z 0 . obviously case h z | z = k (k k) . help (3.17) (3.18) obtain equations change time parameters (3.18): z = z z m( ) = xn vn( ) z m+n( ) (3.19) thus, mean values heisenberg dynamic variables satisfy classical equations motion. consider question lorentz-invariancy theory. lets write operator angular momentum form: j 01 = (x0p1 x1p0 ) + 2 xn6=0 1 n (0 n1 n 1 n0 n ) (3.20) see action angular momentum operator physical states well dened. let | z ip = ( expi j 01 )| z ip (3.21) since  = 0 operator j 01 hermithian, equations (3.12) (3.13) take place well states (3.21). means, states | z ip , determined according (3.21) physical states. owing (2.35) states | z ip | z ip eigenstates momentum operator p. scalar product physical states conserved lorentz transformations (3.21): h z 1 | z = h z1 | z shall calculate mean values dynamic variables variations generated angular momen- tum operator. let variable o(l) =  fundamental variables have: x (l) = (1x0 0x1 ) , variations mean values (3.18) nd: m(l) = (10 01 ) z m(l) = (1z0 0z1 ) (3.22) (3.23) see, lorentz transformation corresponding transformation observable variables {x, p } occurs also gauge transformation gauge degrees freedom take place. lets discuss shortly superposition principle second quantization method. assume, states | z ip | z ip physical. state | z ip + | z ip physical? think, necessary extend superposition principle unphysical, gauge degrees freedom. therefore, second quantization method superposition principle appear limited space hg , opinion, depreciate method. however, physical space superposition principle kept completely. 4. conclusion. quantization methods applied two dimensional string sections 2, 3 next shall call rst second methods, accordingly. results paper reduced following theses: 1) methods lead absence central charge virasoro algebra. cases basis result complete space states scalar product positively dened. 2) rst method successively realizes dirac quantization prescription degenerated systems. case theory dynamic variables, operators physical space states. simple models (two-dimensional string electrodynamics) fact impor- tant since matrix elements observables relative physical states well dened calculated obviously. however, complicated theories four-dimensional gravity specied diculty extremely complicate decision problem, ceasing result technical. 3) second quantization method based weakening dirac quantization conditions degenerated systems. enables treat initial dynamic variables operators physical space states. physical space states vector subspace complete space states positively dened scalar product. statement incorrect rst quantization method. scalar product physical space states induced scalar product complete space states. 4) quantizations result isomorphic spaces physical states. however, unknown, whether result kept complicated models. 5) quantizations result lorentz-invariant theories. note conventional quantization exists state invariant lorentz transformations. state ground state. respect conventional string theory similar standard quantum eld theory point objects. eld theories ground state usually lorentz-invariant. conversely, approach exist state invariant lorentz transformations. reason, quantum string theory proposed analogous quantum theory single relativistic particle. letter case exist lorentz-invariant quantum state single relativistic particle. existence lorentz-invariant state theory would introduce second- quantized string eld. theory ground state vacuum would lorentz-invariant. seems us, second quantization method give interesting results application complicated models. appendix describe dirac quantization  free electromagnetic field. quantization method applied section 2. quantization electromagnetic eld presented form a(x) = z d3k (2)3 1 2k0 {a(~k) eikx + a+ (~k) eikx} (a1) , , .... = 0, 1, 2, 3, kx kx = k0x0 +~k ~x, k0 = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ~k(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) (~k)} generators associative involutive algebra identity element (see sec. 2). nonzero commutation relations generators form {a(~k), a+  = (2)3 (3)(~k ~p) (a2) one see expansion (a1) set elements a(x) linearly equivalent set elements ka(~k) ka+ (~k) two independent elements (for xed ~k) satisfying conditions (~k) algebra a. let 3 xi=1 ki (~k) = 0 , (~p) ] = (2)3 (cid:18)ij kikj ~k2 (cid:19) (3)(~k ~p)  =  = 0 ,  = 0 also  =  = 0 dirac quantization presupposes conditions (~k)| 0 = 0 imposed ground state conditions k a(~k)| = 0 , k a+ (~k)| = 0 (a3) (a4) (a5) (a6) (a7) (a8) imposed physical states. result eqs.
