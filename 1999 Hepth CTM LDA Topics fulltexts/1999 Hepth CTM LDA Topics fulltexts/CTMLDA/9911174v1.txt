using a nonlinear electrodynamics coupled to general relativity a new regular exact black hole
solution is found. the nonlinear theory reduces to the maxwell one in the weak limit, and the
solution corresponds to a charged black hole for |q|  2scm  1.05 m, with metric, curvature
invariants, and electric eld regular everywhere.

in the last years an increasing revival of nonlinear electrodynamic theories is observed [1]. a nonlinear electro-
dynamics was rst proposed by born and infeld [2] at the 30s in order to obtain a niteenergy electron model;
they succeeded in determining an electron of nite radius. after these rst achievements very few investigations were
carried out, as plebanski mentioned in 1970 at the introduction of his monograph [3]: if in recent times the interest
in nle cannot be said to be very popular, it is not due to the fact that one could rise some serious objections against
this theory. it is simply rather dicult in its mathematical formulation, what causes that it is very unlikely to derive
some concrete results in closed form. the mayor responsible of the actual revival, more than 25 years later of the
moment of formulation of quoted statement, is the fact that these nonlinear theories appear as eective theories at
dierent levels of string/mtheory. for instance, the borninfeld action arises as part of the low energy eective
action of the open superstring theory [4,5]. moreover, generalizations of the quoted niteenergy solutions (bions)
are very important in the description of dpbranes solitons of string theory described by diracborninfeld like
actions [68]. this kind of nonlinear theories has also been used as inspiration to build up supersymmetric exten-
sions [911], and nonabelian generalizations [12,13] (these last ones are used to generalize the colored solutions of
einsteinyangmills theory [14]). more recently, in the light of the ads/cft correspondence (cf. [15] for a review),
the nonlinear electrodynamics string approach has been used to obtain solutions describing baryon congurations
which are consistent with connement [16].

in other frameworks, various important results have been obtained. for instance, nonlinear electrodynamics ideas
are source of inspiration to formulate other models, as it is the case of borninfeld skyrmions, where nonlinear terms
are essential in order to obtain stationary solutions [17,18]. it has been established that maxwell and borninfeld
theories are singled out among all electromagnetic theories since they bear both dual invariance [19,20] and good
propagations (in the sense that excitations propagate without shocks) [3,21].
it is also remarkable that all the
nonlinear electrodynamics satisfy the zeroth and rst laws of black hole mechanics [22].

in this paper we are interested in another less explored application of nonlinear electrodynamics: namely its
coupling to einstein theory to obtain regular black hole solutions. previous attempts on this direction with nonlinear
electrodynamics either have been totally unsuccessful or only partially solve the singularity problem;
in certain
approaches the singular region is articially cut o from the whole spacetime, and in others cases the singularity
is only weakened [2325]. we would like to point out that the wellknown borninfeld lagrangian is useless in this
topic, since it gives rise to a singular black hole solution, at least in the spherically symmetric case [26].

the study on global regularity of black hole solutions is quite important in order to understand the nal state of
gravitational collapse of initially regular congurations, since the penrose cosmic censorship conjecture claims that
if singularities predicted by general relativity [27,28] occur, they must be dressed by event horizons (cf. [29,30] for
recent reviews). previous regular black hole models has been proposed [3136]; all of them have been referred to as
bardeen black holes [37], since bardeen was the rst author producing a surprising regular black hole model [31].
none of these models is an exact solution to einstein equations; there is no known physical sources associated with
any of them. regular black hole solutions to einstein equations with physically reasonable sources were reported
in [38,39]. other commonly used approaches to avoid the existence of singularities are based on the search of more
general gravity theories. the best candidate today to produce singularityfree models, even at the classical level, is
string/mtheory, due to its intrinsic nonlocality [40].

we show in this contribution that it is possible to nd regular solutions within general relativity simply by coupling
to the einstein equations an appropriate nonlinear electrodynamics, which in the weak eld approximation becomes
the usual maxwell theory. in what follows we shall exhibit a singularityfree black hole solution to the quoted about
system, which behaves asymptotically as the reissnernordstrom solution.

the dynamics of the theory we are using is governed by the action

would like to recall that there are more general lagrangians depending also on the second invariant, f 
the objectives of this work it is enough to consider only an action as the given in (1). alternatively, one can describe
the considered system using another function, obtained by means of a legendre transformation [41]

where, lf  l/f . dening p  lf f , it can be shown that h is a function of p  1
4 p p  = (lf )2f , i.e.,
dh = (lf )1d((lf )2f ) = hp dp , where hp  h/p . using h, the nonlinear electromagnetic lagrangian is ex-
pressed as l = 2p hp h, depending now on the antisymmetric tensor p . the einsteinnonlinearelectrodynamics
eld equations resulting from action (1) are

g 

 = 2(hp pp    

 (2p hp  h)),

p  = 0.

(3)

(4)

the h function has to satisfy the correspondence to maxwell theory, i.e., h  p for weak elds (p  1). we would
like to point out that in this description the usual electromagnetic strength tensor is given by

f  hp p ,

(5)

this tensor is the physically relevant quantity, although by using the auxiliary tensor p many results can be achieved
more easily.

the particular nonlinear electrodynamics source used to derive our regular black hole solution is determined by

the following function h:

h(p ) = p (cid:16)1  tanh2(cid:16)s 4p2q2p(cid:17)(cid:17) ,

(6)

where s stands for s  |q|/2m; q and m are free parameters which we anticipate to be associated with charge and
mass respectively. notice that this last function fullls the correspondence condition to maxwell theory. in order to
obtain the desired solution, we consider a static and spherically symmetric conguration

g = (cid:18)1 

2m (r)

r (cid:19) dt2 +(cid:18)1

and assume the following ansatz for the antisymmetric eld

with these choices, equations (4) are easily integrated,

where the integration constant was chosen as q, since it plays the role of the electric charge, which becomes apparent
from the evaluation of the electric eld e = ftr = hp d. using expression (6) for h, and (9), the electromagnetic
eld strength results in

f = 2t

e(r) =

4mr3 (cid:0)1  tanh2(q2/2mr)(cid:1)(cid:0)4mr  q2 tanh(q2/2mr)(cid:1) .

(10)

from these expressions two conclusions follow: the electric eld is regular everywhere, and asymptotically behaves as
e = q/r2 + o(1/r4), i.e., a coulomb eld with electric charge q.

the t

t component of einstein equations (3) yields

m (r) = r2h(p ).

(11)

substituting h from (6), with p = q2/2r4, the rst integral of (11) is

where k is an integration constant which can be evaluated using the mass denition, m  limr m (r), thus k = m

m (r) = m tanh(q2/2mr) + k,

(12)

and consequently m (r) = m(cid:0)1  tanh(q2/2mr)(cid:1). entering (12) into (7), one nally obtains the following metric

g =  1 

2m(cid:0)1  tanh(q2/2mr)(cid:1)

r

2m(cid:0)1  tanh(q2/2mr)(cid:1)

(13)

it can be noted that the metric asymptotically behaves as the reissnernordstrom solution, i.e., gtt = 1  2m/r +
q2/r2 + o(1/r4), thus the parameters m and q can be correctly associated with mass and charge respectively.

we shall show that for a certain range of the charge parameter our metric solution (13) describes a black hole,

which in addition is regular everywhere. making the substitutions y = 2mr/q2, s = |q|/2m we rewrite gtt as

 gtt = a(y, s)  1 

1  tanh(1/y)

s2y

.

(14)

independently of the nonvanishing value of s, the last function has a single minimum for ym  1.56, which is the only
positive solution for y of the equation ya(y, s) = 0, which explicitly amounts to

(1  tanh(1/y)) (1  y + tanh(1/y)) = 0.

next, the solution of the equation a(ym, s) = 0 gives the single positive root sc  0.53. at ym, for s < sc the quoted
minimum is negative, for s = sc the minimum vanishes and for s > sc the minimum is positive. from the analytical
expressions of the curvature invariants for metric (13)

r =

2 tanh(1/y)(cid:0)1  tanh2(1/y)(cid:1)

r r =

2(cid:0)1  tanh2(1/y)(cid:1)2

tanh(1/y) (tanh(1/y) + 1)2 (tanh(1/y)  4y)(cid:17) ,

one concludes they are all regular everywhere. hence, for ssc the singularities appearing in (13) due to the van-
ishing of a are only coordinatesingularities describing the existence of event horizons, consequently, we are in the
presence of black hole solutions for |q|  2scm  1.05 m. it should be notice that metrics possessing regular stan-
dard invariants, as (15)(17), could still present nonregular behavior of the dierential invariants, r;1 n r;1 n ,
r;1 n r;1 n , r;1 n r;1 n [42]. because of the structure of the metric components of our so-
lution (13) and their derivatives, the components of the riemman tensor behave generically at r = 0 as  g(r)/ra,
where g(r) is a function vanishing exponentially as r  0. this fact explain the bounded behavior of the invariants
(15)(17). moreover, the quoted behavior at r = 0 extends to the covariant dierential of any order of the riemman
tensor (the derivative of an exponentially vanishing function is again an exponentially vanishing function, and the
contributions due to the christoel symbols entering in the covariant derivatives do not alter the quoted pattern). in
its turn, this again yields a bounded behavior on the dierential invariants of our solution.

for the corresponding values of mass and charge we have, under the strict inequality |q| < 2scm, inner and event
horizons for the killing eld k = /t, dened by kk = gtt = 0. for the equality |q| = 2scm, the horizons shrink
into a single one, where also (kk) = 0, i.e., this case corresponds to an extreme black hole as in the reissner
nordstrom solution. the extension of the metric beyond the horizons, up to r = 0, becomes apparent by passing to
the standard advanced and retarded eddingtonfinkelstein coordinates, in terms of which the metric is wellbehaved
everywhere, even in the extreme case. the maximal extension of this metric can be achieved by following the main
lines presented in [43] for the reissnernordstrom solution, taking care of course, of the more involved integration in

3

our case of the tortoise coordinate r  r a1dr. the global structure of our spacetime is similar to the structure

of the reissnernordstrom black hole, except that the usual singularity of this solution, at r = 0, has been smoothed
out and now it simply corresponds to the origin of the spherical coordinates.

it must be noted that for q = 0 our solution (13) becomes the singular schwarzschild one. for q 6= 0, in the
derived solution, the charge appears by means of a nonlinear electromagnetic eld f , which is singularityfree and
regularizes the associated gravitational eld. in nonlinear electrodynamics, one can think of the spacetime coupled
to the nonlinear eld as produced by a charge distribution through the whole space; in each point of it, the nonlinear
interaction of gravitation and electromagnetism is responsible for the regular character of the elds involved. one
arrives at this eective charge distribution from the nonzero divergence of the electric eld, as can be established from
the maxwell equations (4). nonlinear electrodynamics can be entirely constructed in terms of functions of f and its
invariants. historically the introduction of the auxiliary eld p obeyed the necessity of establishing a relationship
between the new electromagnetic theory with theories currently at hand, as the maxwell theory of continuous media,
through the socalled material equations [2,3]. in turn this p eld resulted to be useful in the derivation of exact
solutions in general relativity [41]; maxwell equations (4) are linear in terms of p . since p is a secondary eld
function of f  the presence of a coulomblike singularity in it is irrelevant, the physics has to be extracted from
f . since f is regular everywhere the conclusion we arrive at is that the nonlinearity of the electrodynamic source
together with the wellknown nonlinearity of the gravitational eld are the only responsible for the regular behavior of
the metric and the matter content. this last conclusion is very important, since indicates that singularities occurring
in physics can be due to extrapolations of the linear interactions to strong regimes, where a nonlinear description
would be more appropriate.
