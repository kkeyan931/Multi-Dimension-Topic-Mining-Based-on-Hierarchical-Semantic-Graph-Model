we compute the cp-odd part of the nite temperature eective action for massive dirac
fermions in the presence of a dirac monopole. we conrm that the induced charge is
temperature dependent, and in the eective action we nd an innite series of cp-violating
terms that generalize the familiar zero temperature f f term. these results are analogous
to recent results concerning nite temperature induced chern-simons terms.

recent studies of nite temperature chern-simons systems in 2 + 1 dimensions have revealed several
interesting new features of induced parity violating terms at nite temperature [18]. it is well known [9,10]
2 there is an induced charge

and this corresponds to an induced chern-simons term in the zero temperature euclidean eective action:

the perturbative expansion in the second line of (4) shows that at nonzero temperature there is an innite
series of parity violating terms, of which the chern-simons term, with temperature dependent charge (3),
is only the rst. the entire series is required at nite t to show that sp odd is invariant under large
gauge transformations a0  a0 + 2
e n , n  z [18]. the higher terms are non-extensive (i.e. they are not
integrals of a lagrangian density), but they all vanish at zero temperature, leaving just the chern-simons
term (2).

in this letter we investigate similar phenomena for the nite temperature induced charge and induced
eective action in 3 + 1 dimensional eld theory. the analogue discrete symmetry we consider is cp, and
we compute the nite t induced charge, and the corresponding nite t induced eective action, for massive
dirac fermions in the presence of a dirac monopole. this should be distinguished from earlier work [12], in a
similar spirit, concerning cp-violating terms at high temperature and nite fermion density in the eective
action for an even number of (massless) chiral fermions.

we recall that the quantum mechanics of a particle of electric charge e and a magnetic pole of magnetic

charge g = 1

4 r d3x~  ~b, is consistent only if these charges satisfy [1315]

2eg  2q = integer

but the dirac hamiltonian

hd = ~  (i~ + e ~ad) + m0

(5)

(6)

(9)

for a fermion in the presence of a dirac monopole ~ad is not self-adjoint, and so requires the introduction
of a self-adjoint extension parameter  that characterizes the boundary conditions (in the s-wave sector) at
the location of the monopole [1618]. the spectrum of the fermions becomes  dependent, and there is an
induced charge of the fermion vacuum given by [1921]

q = 

e
2

2q

(7)

this induced charge corresponds to an induced cp-violating term in the zero temperature euclidean eective
action [19,20]:

(8)

the nite temperature induced charge for fermions in the presence of a dirac monopole has been computed
recently [22,23], and the zero temperature result (7) becomes temperature dependent:

q = e

x


(2q) sin 



xn=0

(2n + 1)2 + x2 + x cos p(2n + 1)2 + x2

where x  m
agrees with the zero temperature result (7) [see also (19) below].

 . in [22] it was checked that the zero temperature limit (i.e. x  ) of the expression (9)
in this letter we conrm the result (9) using a slightly dierent approach, and we then compute the
corresponding cp-odd part of the nite temperature induced eective action for fermions in the background
of a static dirac monopole. for this purpose it is convenient to express everything in terms of the spectral
function (the density of states) of the dirac equation for fermions in the background of a static dirac
monopole. this spectral function is computed in the appendix using an elementary calculation of the
resolvent of the (s-wave) dirac hamiltonian. this leads to a simple integral representation of the summation
formula for the charge in (9). we then obtain a spectral representation of the cp-odd part of the induced
eective action at nite temperature, and study its dependence on temperature and on .

the nite temperature induced charge is expressed in terms of the spectral function as [24]

q =

the spectral function d() is dened in the usual manner as

d() =

where hd is the dirac hamiltonian in (6), and (11) denes d(), the trace of the resolvent of hd.

in all but the lowest partial wave, the spectrum of the dirac hamiltonian hd has a symmetry between
positive and negative energy states [1618], so that only the lowest partial wave contributes to the induced
charge in (10). thus we only need to consider this lowest partial wave sector, which is eectively a one
dimensional radial problem (i.e. one dimensional, but on the half-line r  0). the eective one dimensional
hamiltonian is [1618] (we choose q > 0)

here z2 = k2 + m2, and im k > 0 on the physical sheet, and we have dropped a trivial -independent term
from (z) (see the appendix). notice that for (real) innitesimal  and ,

(m sin  +  + i) = 

( cos )

 + i

(17)

and thus, in addition to scattering states, there is a bound state at z = m sin , provided cos  < 0. using
the result (16) and deforming the contours around the cuts and around the bound state pole (which is only
present if cos  < 0) we obtain the following expression for the induced charge as a real integral:

we plot this induced charge in figure 2 as a function of  for various values of m, and in figure 3 as a
function of m for various values of . it is clear from these figures that in the zero temperature limit
(m  ),  q
eq saturates to , in agreement with the zero temperature result (7). this is easy to verify
analytically from the integral representation (18), since

(20)

(21)

as mentioned in [22], this is consistent with the 2 + 1 dimensional result (3), since it is known [25] that for
2 , the monopole problem with 2q = 1 reduces to that of an aharonov-bohm ux string with ux  = 1
 = 
2 .
these results (18,19,20,21) are in complete agreement with the summation expression (9) for the nite
temperature induced charge found by coriano and parwani in [22]. indeed, the integral expression (18) is
in fact the sommerfeld-watson representation of the sum in (9); and equivalently, the sum in (9) can be
obtained from (15) by deforming the contour around the poles of the tanh( z
2 ) function on the imaginary z
axis. the main utility of the integral representation (18), as compared to the summation representation (9),
becomes apparent when we compute the cp-odd part of the nite temperature induced eective action.

to compute the nite temperature eective action, we work in euclidean space and consider fermions
in the presence of the background gauge eld a = (a0, ~ad), where a0 is a constant (this can always be
achieved by a small gauge transformation), and ~ad is the static vector potential for a dirac monopole. the
nite temperature induced eective action is

s =z 



d d() log cosh(cid:18) 

2

(  iea0)(cid:19)

(22)

as we are only interested in the cp-odd part of the induced eective action, two simplications occur. first,
since only the lowest partial wave sector of the spectrum has a cp-odd piece, we can (just as we did for the
charge) use the reduced spectral function () of the s-wave hamiltonian (12), rather than the full spectral
function d() of the dirac hamiltonian hd in (6). second, since the cp-odd part must be odd in a0, we
can compute the dierence as:

scp odd =

(23)

in this expansion, the rst term, which is linear in a0, corresponds to the familiar zero temperature induced
eective action in (8), but with a temperature dependent induced charge (15) multiplying a0. the higher
order terms in the perturbative expansion (23) of the cp-odd part of the induced eective action are not of
this r f f form. they are non-extensive in euclidean time, as they involve powers of ea0 = (er 
0 a0 d ).
nevertheless, all these non-extensive terms vanish at zero temperature due to factors of sech2( 
2 ), which
vanishes exponentially fast as t  0. thus, at zero temperature only the rst term survives, and the

4

cp-odd part of the nite temperature induced eective action (23) reduces to the familiar zero temperature
expression (8).

given that we know the relevant spectral function (), it is straightforward to write down an integral

finally, we comment on some special values of . when  = 0 or , the cp-odd nite temperature eective
action (23) vanishes, as is easy to verify term by term in the perturbative expansion. this is of course con-
sistent with the fact that cp is not violated for these values of  [1618]. when  = 
2 , we can evaluate every
term in the perturbative expansion in (23). each term contributes one half of the bound state contribution,
so we nd the simple closed form expression:

note that this is exactly the same form as the nite temperature induced parity-odd eective action (4)
found in 2 + 1 dimensions, with the identication q = . this is consistent with the fact [25,22] that the

5

s-wave spectral properties of the  = 
fermion plus aharonov-bohm string system with ux  = q.

2 fermion plus monopole system coincide with those of the planar

to conclude, we note that it would be of interest to extend this analysis to fermions in the presence
of a t hooft-polyakov monopole. the nite temperature induced charge has been computed [23] in the
limit of an innitely massive monopole coupled to light fermions, but it would be interesting to try to go
beyond this point monopole limit. for the eective action, another interesting question is to go beyond the
static background ansatz, to nd other structures that generalize the zero temperature f f term for nonzero
temperature. even in the simpler chern-simons case, the calculation of induced terms at nite temperature
is much more complicated for a non-static background [26,27].

in this appendix we present an elementary derivation of the spectral function for the reduced s-wave

hamiltonian h in (12). the resolvent (or greens function) g(r, r; z) for h is dened by:

appendix

this is a 2  2 matrix equation, so we write

(h  z)g(r, r; z) = (r  r)1

g(r, r) =(cid:18) a(r, r)

c(r, r)

b(r, r)

d(r, r)(cid:19)

(30)

(31)

where we have suppressed the z dependence. using the hamiltonian in (12), we nd that a and c satisfy:

2
r a(r, r)
z + m  (z  m) a(r, r) = (r  r)



c(r, r) = i

ra(r, r)

z + m

(32)

with d and b satisfying similar equations as a and c (respectively) with m  m. it is trivial to solve these
equations in terms of the fundamental solutions

(r) = eikr

where z2 = m2 + k2, and im(k) > 0 on the physical sheet. we nd

a(r, r) = (cid:18) z + m

2ik (cid:19)h(r  r)eik(rr) + (r  r)eik(rr) +  eik(r+r)i

(33)

(34)

where the last term is a solution of the homogeneous equation.
(note that the homogeneous solution
eik(r+r) is excluded by its large r behaviour for r = r and im(k) > 0). the coecient  in (34) is xed
by the boundary condition (13) which, when applied to the resolvent g(r, r), requires that

a(0, r) = i(cid:18) 1 + sin 

cos  (cid:19) c(0, r)

,

r > 0

this determines the constant  to be:

 =

z sin   m  ik cos 

thus, the diagonal part of a(r, r) is

z  m sin

k + i m cos

(35)

(36)

(37)

a similar calculation for d(r, r) leads to

thus, the diagonal resolvent is

(38)

(39)

(r; z)  tr [g(r, r; z)] = 

1

ik(cid:2)z +  m e2ikr(cid:3)

the rst term in (39) corresponds to the free case and may be dropped (also it is independent of  and so
does not contribute to induced cp-violating terms). thus, the trace of the diagonal resolvent is

(z) z

dr (r; z) =

(40)

with  given in (36). note that  has a pole at k = im cos  in the k upper half plane provided cos  < 0.
thus, when cos  < 0 there is a bound state of energy zb = m sin , in addition to scattering states.
