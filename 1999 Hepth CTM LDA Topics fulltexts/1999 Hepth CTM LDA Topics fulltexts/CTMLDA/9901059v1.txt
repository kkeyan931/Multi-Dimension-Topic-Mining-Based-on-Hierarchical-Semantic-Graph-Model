abstract: we study the interaction of two d-particles in the space-time of the shock
wave. we rst write the amplitude in string theory and nd that, at large distances from
the shock-wave source, the o(v4) term in the relative velocity v is an -independent
function of the interbrane separation b. the amplitude is therefore that of supergrav-
ityfor large b, only closed-string massless modes contribute. we then show how the
same result is obtained in the matrix model (at small b) by setting up the formulation
of the dimensionally reduced super yang-mills theory in the curved background of the
shock wave.

1. motivations and summary

d-particles (d0-branes) are the simplest example of dirichlet branes [1]. their dynam-
ics has been studied in order to understand their role in string theory and to compare
their behavior with that of gravitons having momentum in a compactied direction in
the dimensionally reduced d = 11 supergravity theory (that is, the long-distance limit of
m theory). this comparison is important in identifying which dynamical congurations
are susceptible of a description in terms of light open-string degrees of freedom [2, 3],
thus providing the eective low energy theory of d-branes that is at the basis of the
matrix model [4]. this issue has been analyzed both in the case of two-body interac-
tions [5] and in the more arduous case of three bodies [6, 7] (see also [8] for a related
temporary controversy).

a better understanding of the physics of d-brane in non-at space-time is also de-
sirable because it is a subject relevant to many open questions in the interplay between
string theory and gravitation. at the moment, very little is known about the ma-
trix model in curved spaces [9]. recent analyses discuss the case of the schwarzschild
metric [10]. the present paper is a rst enquire in this direction.

1

one of the simplest examples of dynamics in curved space is the motion of two
d-particles in the so-called shock-wave metric, that is, the gravitational eld generated
by a massless particle. since there are two particles in addition to the massless source
of gravity, this is also a case of a three-body interaction, which is of special interest
because of the inherent peculiarities of the three-body dynamics. moreover, the shock-
wave metric itself is particularly important in the study of quantum gravity, see [11,
12, 13, 14, 15] and, recently, [16].

in order to pursue our program, we approach the problem from two dierent points

of view.

first, we perform an analysis in terms of closed-string theory. since the simplest
massless particle in this theory is the graviton, we take it to be the source for the
shock-wave metric.

we write the amplitude for the scattering of two d-particles and two gravitons
describing the incoming and outgoing massless source. the process in which we are
interested emerges as a pinching limit of the full amplitude, where the two graviton
vertex operators collide in the world-sheet, implementing within the string algorithm
the emission of the long-range gravitational eld (the shock-wave) from the incoming-
outgoing source. the full amplitude in this pinching limit describes the interaction of
two d-branes with themselves and with the shock-wave.

in this computational framework, the d-particles are special boundary states at the
ends of a cylindrical world-sheet, and the string amplitude is obtained by computing
the correlator of the two vertices on the cylinder (we consider the ten dimensional
uncompactied space-time). the d-particles are treated in the usual eikonal approxi-
mation, however the computation of the amplitude is not quite conventional because of
the peculiarities of the three-body kinematics. after summing over the spin-structures
we look at the expansion in the relative velocity v of the d-particles.

the rst result of our work is that, up to the fourth order in v, the leading sin-
gularities in the momentum transfer from the source-gravitons are a function of the
interbrane distance b that is the same for arbitrary b and therefore independent from
, see eq. (2.36). this result generalizes well-known properties of brane interaction to
the case of a non-trivial background. the leading singularities in the momentum trans-
fer correspond to the leading powers of the transverse distance r from the shock-wave
source. in particular, the fourth order term in v gets contribution from the leading be-
6), whereas the second order
havior of the shock-wave gravitational eld, that is o(r
term is sub-leading and o(r

8). we will focus on the fourth order term.

of course, the long interbrane-distance regime is dominated by the massless modes

of the closed string and is therefore the supergravity (and m theory) result.

on the other hand, we can consider the same process in the short interbrane-distance
regime where we expect the theory to be described by the dimensionally reduced d = 10
super yang-mills theory corresponding to the exchange of massless open-string states.
the gauge group is su(2) because we want to describe the interaction of two d-

2

particles. the novelty is here that the super yang-mills theory must be written in
a gravitational background. this frames the problem in the language of the matrix
model, for which the d-particles are the fundamental degrees of freedom, in the rather
unconventional case of a curved background. the nal amplitude describes the motion
of two d-particles in the space-time of the shock wave.

we show how, by performing the small v and large r expansion of the matrix-model

result, the amplitude of the closed-string computation is reproduced, see eq. (3.51).

1  ~y 

1 + ~y 

(i)  ~v(i) = 0. we consider the frame where ~v1 + ~v2 = ~y 

consider two d-particles located at ~y

respectively, where ~y 
2 = 0.

we call ~v = ~v1  ~v2 and ~b = ~y 
with an external gravitation eldgenerated by the source graviton moving along the
direction z at a transverse distance ~r (by denition ~r is orthogonal to z) from the
center of mass of the two d-particlesis dominated by a term proportional to 1/q2,
where q is the momentum transfer by the gravitation eld to the system of the two
d-particles. the momentum ~q can be separated into a part qz along the direction
of motion of the external graviton (i.e., the shock-wave direction), and the remaining
orthogonal directions, ~q. in the eikonal approximation, q0 = qz that implies q2 = q2
.
in the frame chosen, the motion of the center of mass of the particles is factorized
out. the eect of the external source graviton on it is taken into account by discon-
nected diagramswhich we do not considerin which the source couples independently
rst to one of the two d-particles and then to the other. here we focus instead on the
relative motion of the two d-particles as they interact with the gravitational eld.

we write the amplitude in d = 10 as

a (rt , b, v) = z dqz dd-2~q

(2)d1 ei~r~qz d z d2w d2z a (z, w; ) ,

where (up to an overall constant)

a (z, w; ) = xs

()s hv2, y2|eh vk(z, z) vp(w, w)|v1, y1is

(2.2)

contains the interaction of the two d-particles with the two gravitons, the vertices of
which are given by

vp(z, z) = (p)

hx (z) + ip  (z)(z)ih x (z) + ip  (z) (z)ieipx ,

(2.3)

and similarly for the other one at w and carrying momentum k. the index s stands
for the three even spin structures of the fermionic propagators. the amplitude (2.2),
in the case of ~v = 0, has been considered in [17].

3

for later use, we dene the two vectors q and p to be

q0 = k0 + p0 ,

~q = ~k + ~p

and p0 = k0  p0 ,

~p = ~k  ~p .

(2.4)

the d-particle kets or bras are given by a tensor product of center-of-mass and
string-oscillator states. the d-particle center-of-mass state in space-time is described
by a fourier transform in terms of the eigenstates of the energy-momentum transfer q.
one has further to integrate over the world-line of the d-particle, which in the
eikonal approximation is the straight line y (t) parameterized by y (t) = (t, ~r(t)) with
~r = ~v t + ~y. we thus get

(2)d ei (q0t ~q ~r(t))|v, qi = z dd-1 ~q

|v, yi = z dtz ddq
notice that in the eikonal approximation we have the constraint q0i = ~vi  ~qi  viqi
l.
this is similar to what holds for the momentum transfer from the source graviton
(whose velocity is equal to 1 along the z-direction) namely q0 = qz.
in eq. (2.2) the hamiltonian h transports the d-particle at ~y 

(2)d-1 ei ~q~y|v, q0 = ~v  ~q, ~qi , (2.5)

h = hcm + hos =

2 + hos ,

where hos contains the string oscillators.

let us also dene the normalized correlators

hvk(z, z) vp(w, w)is = hv2, y2|eh vk(z, z) vp(w, w)|v1, y1is

hv2, y2|ehos|v1, y1is

since we are not interested in spin eects, we can consider only the term proportional

as we shall see, we can neglect in (2.11) o(q2) terms in the quartic pole and o(q4)
terms in the quadratic pole.

while the second term, which comes from the fermionic correlators, is already a
quadratic pole, the rst one, which comes from the bosonic correlators, is quartic and,
in order to contribute, it must be multiplied by terms containing a factor |z  w|2. in
fact, it is the quadratic pole times a factor |z  w|q2/(4), contained in heikxeipxi, that
gives rise to the singularity 1/q2 for which we are looking:

z d2(z  w)|z  w|2+q2/(4) =

82
q2 .

(2.12)

we split the center-of-mass modes x0 from the string-oscillator modes in the cor-

relator:

heikx(z) eipx(w)i = heikx0(z) eipx0(w)iheikx(z) eipx(w)ios ,

(2.13)

and analyze their contributions separately.

2.1. string center-of-mass modes

let us rst consider the string center-of-mass modes. they are given by

(2.14)

where im z plays the role of proper time of closed string propagating from one d-particle
to the other one.

we perform now the integration

z d2zz d2w = z d2(z  w)z d re wz d im w .

(2.25)

every term in (2.24) is o(q2). unless we nd an additional singularity coming from
the integration over im w, the q2 in front of all terms will cancel the 1/q2 coming from
the integration over (z  w) and we would be left without the 1/q2 pole in which
we are interested. we therefore look for terms behaving like (w  w)1q2/4. after
summing over the spin structures, a factor of this form could arise from terms in (2.24)
proportional to q2
s does not contain the
required term. the contributions coming from the terms proportional to q2
s and r2

at the integration limits cancel against each other.

2.3. the nal amplitude

we can now collect all the relevant terms by putting in evidence the integral over z
around the quadratic pole and writing everything else for z = w. the integrand does
not depend on re w and its integration gives a factor 1. we thus obtain

a (r, b, v)  z dd-2~q

d im w hf2(w, w) + f4(w, w)i .

in eq. (2.29), f4(w, w) comes from the bosonic correlator, the term proportional to
|z  w|4 in (2.10), times the terms proportional to |z  w|2 in (2.21) and (2.23) which
compensate for the quartic pole, and is given by

where the factor in front comes from the expansion in v of the 1(iv/2) obtained after
summing over the spin structures (see formulas in the appendix).

the term f2(w, w) in eq. (2.29) originates from the fermionic correlators, the term
proportional to |zw|2 in (2.10), and it has two terms, one that originates from (2.28)
and one from the product of the fermionic correlator (2.27) and the term proportional
to vz in (2.20):

where we have dropped overall factors, the knowledge of which would require xing the
absolute normalization of the string amplitude. as discussed in the introduction, the
rst non-vanishing term is of order o(v4) and its functional behavior in b is independent
from .

notice that, because of the three-body kinematics, the amplitude (2.36) is o(v4),

whereas the interaction of two d-particles without shock wave is o(v3) [18].

a nal comment. the rst term on the right-hand side of eq. (2.24) would also give
an -independent behavior in b, when summed over spin structure and expanded at the
order o(v2). however, since this term is proportional to (~q  ~v)2/q2
, it is sub-leading
for r  , and we do not keep it into account in this paper.

3. the matrix model in the shock wave

the action in the matrix model is given by the dimensionally reduced d = 10 and
n = 1 super yang-mills action. we are going to compute the one-loop contribution to
the eective action in a suitable background.

the gauge-xed bosonic action is

where

since

sb = z dt (cid:20) 1

2

tr ff  + tr (db

 a)2(cid:21) ,

f0i = txi

and fij = i [xi, xj] ,

ai  x i

and a0 = 0 .

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

the action (3.1) is expanded around the classical background eld b by separating
a into b and the uctuation x which is integrated out in the path integral. the
background covariant derivative is dened by

the ghost action is

db

 a = a + i [b, a] .

sc = z dt tr c(db)2c ,

9

(3.4)

(3.5)

where the covariant derivative d can be taken equal to db because we are only inter-
ested in the quadratic part of the ghost action.

similarly, the fermionic action is given by

sf = z dt tr db

  .

take value in the space of the gauge group su(2) (and  a are paulis matrices).

in the eikonal approximation, and before introducing the shock wave, the back-

ground eld b is taken to be

~b =   ~v1 t + ~b1

0

0

~v2 t + ~b2! and b0 = 0 ,

(3.8)

where ~vi and ~bi are the velocities and positions of the two d-particles. in the frame of
reference where ~v1 + ~v2 = 0 and ~b1 + ~b2 = 0, we can then take

~b = (cid:16)~v t + ~b(cid:17) 3

2

,

(3.9)

where now ~v1 = ~v2 = ~v/2, ~b1 = ~b2 = ~b/2; v and b are the relative velocity and
distance in the motion of the two d-particles. as we did for the string case, we have
thus factorized out the motion of the center of mass. notice that the action of the
matrix-valued background eld on the matrix valued quantum eld  (where  can be
a, c or ) is b   = [b, ].

3.1. kinematics

the space-time of the shock wave moving along z from right to left is described by the
metric element

where the light-cone variables (u, v ) are dened to be

ds2 = 2 du dv + h du 2 + d~x 2


u  (z + t)/2 and v  (z  t)/2 .

the coecient h is given by

h = f (~r)(u) ,

from now on, we take u as the evolution variable.
the metric components must be thought as a matrix of su(2) depending on the

positions ~yi of the two d-particles. however,

(3.14)

and, for bz  r, we can neglect the higher order terms and take the metric to be
proportional to the identity matrix.

because of the non-at external metric, care must be taken in lowering and rising
indices. in particular, in going from the background gauge elds with lower indices to
the background coordinates with upper indices, we must use

bu = h bu + bv

and bv = bu

(3.15)

while ~b = ~b.

we now x bu , bv and ~b, by taking into account the trajectories of the d-

particles.

the trajectory of a particle moving in the shock-wave background is (see the ap-

pendix)

(3.16)
by substituting u = (z + t)/2 in (3.16), we reproduce the d-particle trajectories

the part of the background proportional to the identity is irrelevant for our computa-
tion concerning the relative motion of the d-particles.

next, we have

and, since b0 = 0 implying bu = bv , we impose

(3.20)

(3.22)

notice the absence of the shift in the trajectory, that is present in the one particle
problem; it cancels out in the two-body relative motion. also, we will see that we only
need the leading rst-order terms in the velocity in (3.19) and (3.22).

derivatives in the curved background are often complicated. however, an important

property of the shock-wave metric is that, since v gv  = v (u) = 0, we have that

(3.23)
with great simplications in the computation. moreover, g = 1 and the covariant
derivative is the usual one. the derivative

 g = gdb


db

u = v

(3.24)

because the elds do not depend on z.

similarly, for the fermions we can pass the covariant derivative db

 through the

-matrices, and use

tr  ln(d) =

1

tr  ln(d)2 =

1

tr  ln(cid:20)d2 +

1
2

f (cid:21)

(3.25)

even in the shock-wave space-time (the spin connection is zero). eq. (3.25) simplies
the evaluation of the fermionic path integral.

3.2. the quadratic action

because we are interested in a one-loop computation, we need only the part of the
action that is quadratic in the elds. the bosonic action is then

sb = z du tr x h

d2  2if 

i x .

(3.26)

in eq. (3.26), the background eld strength f 

 is independent from u. as we shall
see, because the result is already proportional to f 4, we only need the part of f that
is leading order in v and which is given by (,  = u, v,)

f

(3.27)

notice that in writing (3.27), we used v h = 0 as well as u h  0 (consistently with
(3.24)) since terms proportional to (u) would eventually multiply functions of u 2 in
the nal amplitude and would not contribute.

12

in order to compute the amplitude for the scattering of the two d-particles in the

external eld of the shock wave, we need

a (r, b, v) = lnz [dx][d c][dc][d][d ]esb sc sf =

(3.28)

the operator traces can be written in terms of the schwinger representation by

introducing a parameter s. the amplitude (3.28) thus becomes

a (r, b, v) = ab + af ,

where

ab =

in (3.30) and (3.31) we have separated between parenthesis the part that does

(3.32)

(3.33)

in writing (3.33), we have used (3.19), (3.22) and (3.24) after replacing for v and
x the values on the trajectory. in the the term proportional to h, we have neglected
contributions proportional to v because this part is going to be multiply by v4. the
operator d2 acts on the components a of the matrix-valued eld  = a a/2 and bu ,
bv and b in eq. (3.33) are the coecients in front of 3/2 in eq. (3.22) that remain
after performing the trace over the gauge group. terms linear in b do not contribute
to the trace since b  3.

the kernel (3.32) can be expanded around the at space-time (h = 0) part:

wg(s, u)  lim

u1,u2u wg(s, u1, u2) = w(s, u) + h (s, u) + o(h2) ,

where

w(s, u) = lim

u1,2uhu1|es(2

u +2v2u 2+b2)|u2i

(3.34)

(3.35)

13

is just the kernel for the harmonic oscillator, that is

w(s, u) = r

v

2 sin 4vs

esb2

evu 2(cos 4vs1)/ sin 4vs .

(3.36)

for the at space-time case, (3.28) reproduces the known result [18, 3, 5] for the
 vanish

phase shift of two interacting d-particles. in fact, traces of odd powers of f 
and we have that

tr  e2isf 

  2 = (10  2) + 2 (cos 4 vs  1)

and

since tr  f 2 = 8v2 and

tr  es f  /2 = 16 cos 2 vs ,

tr  (f )2 = (16  2) tr  f 2 ,

where the factor 16 comes from the dirac trace.

by taking the traces in (3.30) and (3.31) we thus nd

a (b, v)  z 

0

ds

s z du w(s, u)h4 cos 2 vs  cos 4 vs  3i ,

where

z du w(s, u) =

esb2

2 sin 2 sv

.

(3.37)

(3.38)

(3.39)

(3.40)

(3.41)

in the light-cone formalism, we reproduce the formulas of refs. [18, 3, 5] with 2 v
in the place of v there. the dierent factor in front of v is absorbed in the overall
normalization since the use of these formulas for string theory makes sense only up to
o(v4) (actually, in the at case, o(v3), due to eq. (3.41)).

as we shall see, contrary to the at space-time case, the amplitude in the shock-
wave background is proportional to h = f (r)(u), and therefore the integration over u

yields r du hw  f (r)esb2 instead of (3.41). in agreement with the string amplitude

(2.36), the amplitude in the curved background is thus o(v4) rather than o(v3), as in
the at case.

3.3. the scattering amplitude

in order to compute (3.28) in the non-at metric, we must expand the exponential
functions in (3.30) and (3.31) in powers of h. to the leading order in h, we have that

tr f 2 = 8(cid:16)v2 + h v2

z(cid:17) , tr f 4 = 32(cid:16)v4 + 2h v2

zv2(cid:17) .

as in the at-space case above, (3.39) holds together with

tr  (f )4 = (16  16) tr f 4

14

(3.42)

(3.43)

and it is true in general that (tr f 2)2 = 2 tr f 4.

we can thus expand to fourth order the exponential functions and write that



1

2 (cid:16)tr  e2isf 

  2(cid:17) +

1

4 (cid:16)tr  es f  /2(cid:17) = 

s4
4

tr f 4 ,

(3.44)

where the constant terms as well as those quadratic in the velocity have cancelled as
it happens in the at-metric case.

by means of (3.44), we can now write (3.28) as

a (r, b, v)  z du z ds

s hw(s, u) + h (s, u)i 

s4
4

tr f 4! ,

(3.45)

where (s, u) is given by

and w by (3.36).

collecting all terms linear in h yields, apart for an overall factor:

where we have now taken (3.36) at v = 0.

(3.47)

going back to the string computation, the amplitude (2.36) is what we want to compare
with the matrix theory result in (3.47). after changing   1/2s, setting d = 10, and
normalizing the incoming and outgoing source-graviton states each by the usual factor
1/k0, we obtain that the string amplitude is (up to an overall constant)

(3.49)

after integrating (3.47) over u, we see that the matrix model result (up to an overall
constant) becomes equal to that of string theory except for the numerical factor 7/4
instead of 11/4 in front of the v4 term. this missing term comes from the inclusion
of the jacobian arising from the -function constraining the d-particles to lie on their
respective trajectories, which in our formalism amounts to implementing (3.20) and

15

(3.21) for both. in order to enforce this constraint, we replace the integration over u
by

(i)dbv

the extra (leading in h) factor 1 + h in front, after multiplication by s4 tr f 4/4,
provides the missing term 4s4v4h that adds a term v4 to (3.48) and makes the matrix-
model result agree with that of string theory, since 7/4 + 1 = 11/4, and we nally
obtain that

discussions.

a. notation and useful formulas

we collect in this appendix formulas and results that we used in the previous sections
but were too cumbersome to be inserted in the main text.

a.1. string propagators

the bosonic propagator is given by (see, for instance, [19])

hx (z)x (w)i = g(z, w)  sg(z, w) ,

where the metric signature is given by  = (1, ij),

g(z, w) =

at v 6= 0 we have that (here the direction 1 is parallel and the directions i, j are
orthogonal to ~v) [20]

h0(z)0(w)is = h1(z)1(w)is =
h0(z)1(w)is = h1(z)0(w)is =

(a.6)

(a.7)

(a.8)

in performing the sum over the spin structure, it useful to use riemanns identity:

1

2 xs

where

()s s(u)s(v)s(w)s(s) = 1(u1)1(v1)1(w1)1(s1) ,

(a.9)

u1 = (u + v + w + s)/2
w1 = (u  v + w  s)/2

v1 = (u + v  w  s)/2
s1 = (u  v  w + s)/2 .

(a.10)

a.2. shock-wave metric

the space-time of the shock wave is dened by the metric element (3.10) which gives
a metric tensor (its signature is such that 00 = 1) with components:

gu u = h ,

gu v = 1 ,

gv v = 0 ,

gij = ij

and

gu u = 0 ,

gu v = 1 ,

gv v = h ,

gij = ij ,

where h = f (r)(u).

similarly, the einbein, necessary in writing the fermionic action, is given by

eu
u = ev

u = 1 ,

eu
v = 0 ,

ev
u =

h
2

,

ej
i = i
j

(a.11)

(a.12)

(a.13)

17

where ea

abeb

 = g. the spin connection is zero: ab = 0.

the action for the motion of one particle in the shock-wave metric is found by

varying the metric line element (3.10) and it is given by

s = z ds
2

du
ds

dv
ds

ds !2
+ f (u)  du

+  d~x

ds !2
 .

the trajectory is therefore

v = u w + w0  1
u = s
~x = ~vw u + ~bw ,

2f (u)




where the coecients are given in section 3 by eqs. (3.17) and (3.18).
