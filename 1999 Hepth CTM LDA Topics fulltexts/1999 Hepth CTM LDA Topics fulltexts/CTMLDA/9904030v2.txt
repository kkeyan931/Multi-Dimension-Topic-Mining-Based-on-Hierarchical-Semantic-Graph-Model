abstract

the qed renormalization is restudied by using a mass-dependent
subtraction which is performed at a time-like renormalization point.
the subtraction exactly respects necessary physical and mathematical
requirements such as the gauge symmetry, the lorentz- invariance and
the mathematical convergence. therefore, the renormalized results
derived in the subtraction scheme are faithful and have no ambiguity.
especially, it is proved that the solution of the renormalization group
equation satised by a renormalized wave function, propagator or ver-
tex can be xed by applying the renormalization boundary condition
and, thus, an exact s-matrix element can be expressed in the form as
written in the tree diagram approximation provided that the coupling
constant and the fermion mass are replaced by their eective ones. in
the one-loop approximation, the eective coupling constant and the
eective fermion mass obtained by solving their renormalization group
equations are given in rigorous and explicit expressions which are suit-
able in the whole range of distance and exhibit physically reasonable
asymptotic behaviors.

1.introduction

in the renormalization of quantum eld theories, to extract nite physi-
cal results from higher order perturbative calculations, a certain subtraction
scheme is necessary to be used so as to remove the divergences occurring in
the calculations. there are various subtraction schemes in the literature, such
as the minimal subtraction (ms)1, the modied minimal subtraction (ms)
2, the momentum space subtraction (mom)3, the on-mass-shell subtraction
(os) 4,5, the o-mass shell subtraction (oms)6 and etc.. however, there
exists a serious ambiguity problem3,6.7 that dierent subtraction schemes in
general give dierent physical predictions, conicting the fact that the phys-
ical observables are independent of the subtraction schemes. ordinarily, it
is argued that the ambiguity appears only in nite order perturbative cal-
culations, while the exact result given by the whole perturbation series is
scheme- independent. though only a nite order perturbative calculation is
able to be done in practice, one still expects to get unambiguous results from
such a calculation. to solve the ambiguity problem, several prescriptions,
such as the minimal sensitivity principle7, the eective charge method8 and
some others9 , were proposed in the past. by the principle of minimal sen-
sitivity, an additional condition has to be introduced and imposed on the
result calculated in a nite order perturbative approximation so as to ob-
tain an optimum approximant which is least sensitive to variations in the
unphysical parameters.
in the eective charge method, the use of a cou-
pling constant is abandoned. instead, an eective charge is associated with
each physical quantity and used to determine the gell-mann-low function in
the renormalization group equation (rge). in this way, a renormalization-
scheme-invariant result can be found from the rge. in ref.(9), the authors
developed a new perturbation approach to renormalizable eld theories. this
approach is based on the observation that if the perturbation series of a quan-
tity r is not directly computable due to that the expansion coecients are
innite, the unambiguous result of the quantity can be found by solving
the dierential equation q dr(q)
dq = f (r(q)) where f(r) is well-dened and
can be expanded as a series of r. particularly, the nite coecients of the
expansion of f(r) are renormalization-scheme-independent and in one-to-
one correspondence with the ones in the ordinary perturbation series of the
r. the prescriptions mentioned above are somehow dierent from the con-
ventional perturbation theory in which the coupling constant is commonly

2

chosen to be the expansion parameter for a perturbation series.

in this paper, we wish to deal with the ambiguity problem from a dif-
ferent angle. it will be shown that the ambiguity problem can be directly
tackled in the conventional perturbation theory by the renormalization group
method1015. the advantage of this method is that the anomalous dimension
in a rge is well-dened although it is computed from the renormalization
constant which is divergent in its original denition. in comparison of the
renormalization group method with the aforementioned approach proposed
in ref.(9), we see, both of them are much similar to one another in methodol-
ogy. this suggests that the renormalization group method is also possible to
yield the theoretical results which are free from the ambiguity. the possibil-
ity relies on how to choose a good subtraction scheme which gives rise to such
renormalization constants that they lead to unique anomalous dimensions.
the so-called good subtraction scheme means that it must respect necessary
physical and mathematical requirements such as the gauge symmetry, the
lorentz invariance and the mathematical convergence principle. the neces-
sity of these requirements is clear. particularly, in the renormalization group
approach to the renormalization problem, the renormalization constants ob-
tained from a subtraction scheme not only serve to subtract the divergences,
but also are directly used to derive physical results. apparently, to guarantee
the calculated results to be able to give faithful theoretical predictions, the
subtraction procedure necessarily complies with the basic principles estab-
lished well in physics and mathematics. otherwise, the subtraction scheme
should be discarded and thus the scheme-ambiguity will be reduced. let
us explain this viewpoint in some detail from the following aspects:
(1)
for a gauge eld theory, as one knows, the gauge-invariance is embodied in
the ward identity. this identity is a fundamental constraint for the the-
ory. therefore, a subtraction scheme, if it is applicable, could not defy this
identity. as will be demonstrated in latter sections, the ward identity not
only establishes exact relations between renormalization constants, but also
determines the functional structure of renormalization constants; (2) the
lorentz-invariance is partly reected in the energy-momentum conservation
which holds at every vertex. since the renormalization point in the renor-
malization constants will be eventually transformed to the momentum in the
solutions of rges, obviously, in order to get correct functional relations of
the solutions with the momentum, the energy-momentum conservation could
not be violated by the subtraction of vertices; (3) why the convergence

3

principle is required in the renormalization calculation? as we know, the
renormalization constants are divergent in their original appearance. such
divergent quantities are not well-dened mathematically and hence are not
directly calculable9because we are not allowed to apply any computational
rule to do a meaningful or unambiguous calculation for this kind of quanti-
ties. the meaningful calculation can only be done for the regularized form of
renormalization constants which are derived from corresponding regularized
feynman integrals in a subtraction scheme. the necessity of introducing the
regularization procedure in the quantum eld theory may clearly be seen
from the mathematical viewpoint as illustrated in appendix a. therefore,
in renormalization group calculations, the correct procedure of computing
anomalous dimensions is starting from the regularized form of renormaliza-
tion constants. the limit operation taken for the regularization parameter
should be performed after completing the dierentiation with respect to the
renormalization point. since the anomalous dimensions are convergent, the
limit is meaningful and would give denite results. obviously, the above pro-
cedure of computing the anomalous dimensions agrees with the convergence
principle; (4) in comparison with the other subtraction schemes, the mom
scheme appears to be more suitable for renormalization group calculations.
this is because this scheme naturally provides not only a renormalization
point which is needed for the renormalization group calculation, but also
a renormalization boundary condition for a renormalized quantity (a wave
function, a vertex or a propagator), which will be used to x the solution of
the rge for the renormalized quantify.

based on the essential points of view stated above, it may be found that
a renormalized quantity can be unambiguously determined by its rge and
thus a renormalized s-matrix element can be given in an unique form with-
out any ambiguity. to illustrate this point, we limit ourselves in this paper
to take the qed renormalization as an example to show how the ambiguity
can be eliminated. as one knows, the qed renormalization has been ex-
tensively investigated by employing the os, ms and mom schemes in the
previous works46,1026. but, most of these studies are concentrated on the
large momentum (short distance) behaviors of some quantities for the sake
of simplicity of the calculation. in this paper, we restudy the qed renormal-
ization with the following features: (1) the renormalization is performed in
a mass-dependent scheme other than in the mass-independent scheme which
was adopted in many previous works2026. the mass-dependent scheme obvi-

4

ously is more suitable for the case that the mass of a charged fermion can not
be set to be zero; (2) the subtraction is carried out in such a mom scheme
that the renormalization point is mainly taken to be an arbitrary time-like
momentum other than a space-like momentum as chosen in the conventional
mom scheme. the time-like mom scheme actually is a generalized mass-
shell scheme (gms). the prominent advantage of the gms scheme is that
in this scheme the scale of renormalization point can naturally be connected
with the scale of momenta and the results obtained can directly be converted
to the corresponding ones given in the os-scheme ; (3) the subtraction is
implemented by fully respecting the necessary physical and mathematical
principles mentioned before . therefore, the results obtained are faithful
and free of ambiguity; (4) the eective coupling constant and the eective
fermion mass obtained in the one-loop approximation are given exact and
explicit expressions which were never found in the literature. these expres-
sions exhibit physically reasonable infrared and ultraviolet behaviors. we
will pay main attention to the infrared (large distance) behavior because this
behavior is more sensitive to identify whether a subtraction is suitable or not
for the qed renormalization.

the rest of this paper is arranged as follows.

in sect.2, we sketch
the rge and its solution and show how a s-matrix element can be free
of ambiguity.
in sect.3, we briey discuss the ward identity and give a
derivation of the subtraction version of the fermion self-energy in the gms
scheme.
in sect.4, we derive an exact expression of the one-loop eective
coupling constant and discuss its asymptotic property. in sect.5, the same
thing will be done for the eective fermion mass. the last section serves to
make some comments and discussions. in appendix a, we show a couple of
mathematical examples to help understanding the regularization procedure
used in the renormalization group calculations.

2.solution to rge and s-matrix element

among dierent formulations of the rge (see the review given in ref.(14))1015,

we like to employ the approach presented in ref.(15). but, we work in a
mass-dependent renormalization scheme, therefore, the anomalous dimen-
sion in the rge depends not only on the coupling constant, but also on the
fermion mass. suppose fr is a renormalized quantity. in the multiplicative

5

renormalization, it is related to the unrenormalized one f in such a way

f = zf fr

(2. 1)

where zf is the renormalization constant of f . in gms scheme, the zf and
fr are all functions of the renormalization point  = 0et. dierentiating
eq.(2.1) with respect to the  and noticing that the f is independent of ,
we immediately obtain a rge satised by the function fr



dfr
d

+ f fr = 0

where f is the anomalous dimension dened by

f = 

d
d

ln zf

(2. 2)

(2. 3)

we rst note here that the anomalous dimension can only depends on the
ratio  = mr
 , f = f (gr, ), because the renormalization constant is dimen-
sionless. next, we note, eq.(2.2) is suitable for a physical parameter (mass
or coupling constant), a propagator, a vertex, a wave function or some other
green function. if the function fr stands for a renormalized green function,
vertex or wave function, in general, it not only depends explicitly on the scale
, but also on the renormalized coupling constant gr, mass mr and gauge
parameter r which are all functions of , fr = fr(p, gr(), mr(), r(); )
where p symbolizes all the momenta. considering that the function fr is ho-
mogeneous in the momentum and mass, it may be written, under the scaling
transformation of momentum p = p0 , as follows

fr(p; gr, mr, r, ) = df fr(p0; gr,

mr


, r;




)

(2. 4)

where df is the canonical dimension of f . since the renormalization point
is a momentum taken to subtract the divergence, we may set  = 0 where
 = et which is taken to be the same as in p = p0. noticing the above
transformation, the solution of the rge in eq.(2.2) can be expressed as15

fr(p; gr, mr, r, 0) = df er 

1

d

 f ()fr(p0;

gr(), mr()1, r(); 0)

(2. 5)

6

where gr(), mr() and r() are the running coupling constant, the running
mass and the running gauge parameter, respectively. the solution written
above shows the behavior of the function fr under the scaling of momenta.
how to determine the function fr(p0;   , 0) on the rhs of eq.(2.5)
when the fr(p0, ...) stands for a wave function, a propagator or a vertex?
this question can be unambiguously answered in mom scheme, but was not
answered clearly in the literature 27,28. noticing that the momentum p0 and
the renormalization point 0 are xed, but may be chosen arbitrarily, we
may, certainly, set p2
0. with this choice, by making use of the following
boundary condition satised by a propagator, a vertex or a wave function

0 = 2

fr(p0; gr, mr, r, ) |p 2

0 =2= f (0)

r (p0; gr, mr, r)

(2. 6)

where the function f (0)
r (p; gr, mr, r) is of the form of free propagator, bare
vertex or free wave function and independent of the renormalization point
(see the examples given in the next section) and considering the homogeneity
of the function fr as mentioned in eq.(2.4), we may write

df fr (p0; gr(), mr()1, r(), 0) |
= f (0)

r

0=2
p2

0

(p; gr(), mr(), r())(2. 7)

where the renormalized coupling constant, mass and vertex in the function
f (0)
r (p, ...) become the running ones. with the expression given in eq.(2.7),
eq.(2.5) will nally be written in the form

fr(p; gr, mr, r) = er 

1

d

 f ()f (0)

r (p; gr(), mr(), r())

(2. 8)

for a gauge eld theory, it is easy to check that the anomalous dimension in
eq.( 2.8) will be cancelled out in s-matrix elements. to show this point more
specically, let us take the two-electron scattering taking place in t-channel
as an example. considering that a s-matrix element expressed in terms of
unrenormalized quantities is equal to that represented by the corresponding
renormalized quantities, the scattering amplitude may be written as



sf i = u

r(p



1, p1)u

r(p1)idr(k)u

r (p





2)

r(p



2, p2)u

r(p2)

(2. 9)

r(p, p) and idr(k) represent the
where k = p1  p1 = p2  p2; u
fermion wave function, the proper vertex and the photon propagator respec-
tively which are all renormalized. the renormalization constants of the wave

function, the propagator and the vertex will be designated by z2, z3 and
z respectively. the constant z is dened as

z = z1

2 z 1

2

(2. 10)

because the vertex in eq.(2.9) contains a coupling constant in it.

according to the formula given in eq.(2.8), the renormalized fermion wave
function, photon propagator and vertex can be represented in the forms as
shown below. for the fermion wave function, we have

u

is the anomalous dimension of the vertex here the relation in eq.(2.10) has
been used. upon substituting eqs.(2.11), (2.14) and (2.17) into eq.(2.9) and
noticing eqs.( 2.13), (2.16) and (2.19), we nd that the anomalous dimensions
in the s-matrix element are all cancelled out with each other. as a result,
we arrive at
sf i = u(0)

r (p1, p1)u(0)

r(p1)id(0)

r(k)u(0)

 (p2)(0)

(2. 19)
this expression clearly shows that the exact s-matrix element of the two-
electron scattering can be represented in the form as given in the lowest order
(tree diagram) approximation except that all the physical parameters in the
matrix elements are replaced by their eective (running) ones. for other
s-matrix elements, the conclusion is the same. this is because any s-matrix
element is unexceptionably expressed in terms of a number of wave functions,
propagators and proper vertices each of which can be represented in the form
as shown in eq.(2.8) and the anomalous dimensions in the matrix element
, as can be easily proved, are all cancelled out eventually. this result and
the fact that any s-matrix element is independent of the gauge parameter
( this is the so-called gauge-invariance of s-matrix which is implied by the
unitarity of s-matrix elements) indicate that the task of renormalization for
a gauge eld theory is reduced to nd the running coupling constant and the
running mass by their rges. these running quantities completely describe
the eect of higher order perturbative corrections.

3. ward identity

in qed renormalization, the following ward identity plays crucial role 6

(p; p)|p=p = 

(p)
p

9

(3. 1)

where (p, p) represents the vertex correction which is dened by taking
out a coupling constant e and (p) denotes the fermion self-energy. firstly,
we show how the above identity determines the subtraction of the fermion

self-energy p(p). according to the ward identity, the divergence in (p, p)
should be, in the gms scheme, subtracted at a time-like (minkowski) renor-
malization point for the momenta of the external fermion lines, p2 = p2 = 2
which implies 6 p =6 p = . when  = m (the fermion mass), we will come to
the subtraction in the os scheme. in the case of  6= m, the subtraction is
dened on a generalized mass shell. at the renormalization point , we have

(p, p) |6p=6p== l

thus, the vertex correction may be represented as

(p, p) = l + c

(p, p)

(3. 2)

(3. 3)

where l is a divergent constant depending on  and c
correction satisfying the boundary condition
(p, p) |6p=6p== 0
c

(p, p) is the nite

(3. 4)

on inserting eq.(3.3) into eq.(3.1) and integrating the both sides of

eq.(3.1) over the momentum p, we get

(p)  () = (6 p  )l z p

p

0

dpc

(p, p)

(3. 5)

where the momentum p0 is chosen to make 6 p0 = . since the last term on
the rhs of eq.(3.5) vanishes when p  p

0 , we may write

z p

p

0

dpc

(p, p) = (6 p  )c(p2)

(3. 6)

where c(p2) is a convergent function satisfying the following boundary con-
dition

which is implied by eq.(3.4). substituting eq.(3.6) into eq.(3.5) and setting

c(p2) |p2=2= 0

(3. 7)

() = a

10

(3. 8)

and

the self-energy is nally written as

l = b

(p) = a + (6 p  )[b  c(p2)]

(3. 9)

(3. 10)

where the constants a and b have absorbed all the divergences appearing in
the (p). the above derivation shows that the subtraction given in eq.(3.10)
is uniquely correct in the gms scheme as it is compatible with the ward
identity. according to the subtraction in eq.(3.3), the full vertex can be
written as

(p, p) =  + (p, p)
 (p, p)

= z1

1 r

where z1 is the vertex renormalization constant dened as

z1

1 = 1 + l

and r

 (p, p) is the renormalized vertex represented by

 (p, p) =  + r
r

 (p, p)

which satises the boundary condition

r(p, p) |6p=6p== 

(3. 11)

(3. 12)

(3. 13)

(3. 14)

based on the subtraction given in eq.(3.10), the full fermion propagator

may be renormalized in such a way

isf (p) =

i

6 p  m  (p) + i

= z2isr

f (p)

(3. 15)

where z2 is the propagator renormalization constant dened by

f (p) =

i

(3. 16)

(3. 17)

which has a boundary condition as follows

sr
f (p) |p2=2=

i

6 p  mr

(3. 18)

in eq.(3.17), mr and r(p) designate the renormalized mass and the nite
correction of the self-energy respectively. the renormalized mass is dened
by

mr = z1

m m

where zm is the mass renormalization constant expressed by

z1
m = 1 + z2[am1 + (1  m1)b]

particularly, from eqs.(3.9), (3.12) and (3.16). it is clear to see

z1 = z2

(3. 19)

(3. 20)

(3. 21)

this just is the ward identity obeyed by the renormalization constants.

let us verify whether the ward identity is fullled in the one-loop
approximation. the feynman integrals of one-loop diagrams in qed have
been calculated in the literature by various regularization procedures36,14,15,.
in the gms scheme, the fermion self-energy depicted in fig.(1a), according
to the dimensional regularization procedure, is regularized in the form

of order e2, the renormalization constants dened in eq.(3.12) and (3.16)
will be represented as z1 = 1  l and z2 = 1 + b.
in the limit   0,
these constants are divergent, being not well-dened. so, to verify the ward
identity in eq.(3.21), it is suitable to see whether their anomalous dimensions
satisfy the corresponding identity

1 = 2

(3. 29)

where i() = lim0  d
d ln zi(, ) (i=1,2). for the renormalization group
calculations, in practice, the above identity is only necessary to be required.

it is easy to see that in these expressions, only the terms proportional 1
give nonvanishing contributions to the anomalous dimensions. however, in
the case of m 6= 0, the terms proportional to 1 in eqs.(3.27) and (3.28)
give dierent results. in this case, to ensure the identity in eq.(3.29) to be
satised, the other terms without containing 1 in eqs.(3.27) and (3.28)
must be taken into account.

(4. 14)

it is clear that when   0, the r() tends to zero. this desirable behavior,
which indicates that at large distance (small momentum) the interacting

will be approximated by

this result was given previously in the mass-independent ms scheme.
in
the latter scheme, the  function in eq.(4.8) is only a function of the
er() since fe() = 1 due to m = 0 in this case. but, in general, the
mass of a charged particle is not zero. therefore, the result given in the ms
scheme can only be viewed as an approximation in the large momentum limit
from the viewpoint of conventional perturbation theory. fig.(3) shows that
the r() increases with the growth of  and tends to innity when the 
3r = e287 (the landau pole). if
approaches an extremely large value 0  e
the  goes from 0 to innity, we nd, the r() will become negative and
tends to zero. this result is unreasonable, conicting with the physics. the
unreasonableness indicates that in the region [0,), the qed perturbation
theory and even the qed itself is invalid5.

as we see, the function s() and hence the eective mass mr() are gauge-
dependent. the gauge-dependence is displayed in fig.(4). the gure shows
that for  < 10, the eective masses given in dierent gauges are almost the
same and behave as a constant in the region of  < 1, while, in the region
of  > 1, they all tend to zero with the growth of . but, the mr() given
in the gauge of  6= 0 goes to zero more rapidly than the one given in the
landau gauge ( = 0). to be specic, in the following we show the result
given in the landau gauge which was regarded as the preferred gauge in the
literature3,29,

mr() = mre

in the limit   0,

(5. 11)

this clearly indicates that when  varies from 1 to zero, the mr() almost
keeps unchanged. this result physically is reasonable. whereas, in the region
of  > 1, the mr() decreases with increase of  and goes to zero near the
critical point 0. this behavior suggests that at very high energy, the fermion
mass may be ignored in the evaluation of s-matrix elements.

6.comments and discussions

in this paper, the qed renormalization has been restudied in the gms
scheme. the exact and explicit expressions of the one-loop eective coupling
constant and fermion mass are obtained in the mass-dependent renormal-
ization scheme and show reasonable asymptotic behaviors. a key point to
achieve these results is that the subtraction is performed in the way of re-
specting the ward identity, i.e.
the gauge symmetry. for comparison, it
is mentioned that in some previous literature15,19, the fermion self-energy is
represented in such a form

(p) = a(p2) 6 p + b(p2)m

(6. 1)

if we subtract the divergence in the (p) at the renormalization point p2 = 2,
the fermion propagator is still expressed in the form as written in eqs.(3.15)
and (3.17); but, the renormalization constants z2 and zm are now dened
by

z1
2 = 1  a(2), z1

m = z2[1 + b(2)]

(6. 2)

the one-loop expressions of the a(2) and b(2) can directly be read from
eq.(3.22). here, we show the one-loop anomalous dimension of fermion prop-
agator which is given by the above subtraction

2 = lim

e2

]

(6. 3)

in comparison of the above 2 with the 1 shown in eq.(3.30), we see, the
ward identity in eq.(3.29) can not be fullled unless in the zero-mass limit
(  0). since the ward identity is an essential criterion to identify whether
a subtraction is correct or not, the subtraction stated above should be ex-
cluded from the mass-dependent renormalization.

another point we would like to address is that in the ward identity
shown in eq.(3.1), the momenta p and p on the fermion lines in the vertex
are set to be equal. according to the energy-momentum conservation, the
momentum k on the photon line should be equal to zero. correspondingly,

20

the subtraction shown in eq.(3.2) was carried out at the so-called asym-
metric points, p2 = p2 = 2 and k2 = (p  p)2 = 0. these subtraction
points coincide with the energy- momentum conservation, i.e., the lorentz-
invariance. nevertheless, the subtraction performed at the symmetric point
p2 = p2 = k2 = 2 was often used in the previous works 3,19,20. this sub-
traction not only makes the calculation too complicated, but also violates
the energy- momentum conservation which holds in the vertex. that is why
the symmetric point subtraction is beyond our choice.

as mentioned in introduction, the gms subtraction is a kind of mom
scheme in which the renormalization points are chosen to be time-like. in
contrast, in the conventional mom scheme3,6,29, the renormalization points
were chosen to be space-like, i.e. p2
i = 2 which implies 6 pi = i. in this
scheme, the one-loop result for the anomalous dimension e can be written
out from eq.(4.6) by the transformation   i. that is

which is identical to that given in refs.(6) and (29). in comparison of eq.(6.4)
with eq.(4.6), we see, the coecients of 2 in eq.(6.4) changes a minus sign.
substituting eq.(6.4) into eq.(4.1) and solving the latter equation, we obtain
the running coupling constant which is still represented in eq.(4.11), but the
function g() in eq.(4.11) is now given by

g() =

this expression is obviously dierent from the corresponding one written
in eqs.(4.12) and (4.13). at small distance (  ), eq.(6.5) still gives
the approximate expression presented in eq.(4.15). however, at large dis-
tance, as shown in fig.(2), the r() behaves almost a constant. when
  0, it approaches to a value equal to 0.99986r, unlike the r() given
in eqs.(4.11)-(4.13) which tends to zero. let us examine the eective mass.
as we have seen from sect.5, the one-loop eective fermion mass given in
the gms scheme is real. however, in the space-like momentum subtraction,
due to 6 p = i, the eective mass will contain an imaginary part. this re-
sult can be seen from the function fm() whose one-loop expression given in

21

the usual mom scheme can be obtained from eq.(5.3) by the transforma-
tion   i and therefore becomes complex. the both of subtractions may
presumably be suitable for dierent processes of dierent physical natures.
but, if the eective mass is required to be real, the subtraction at space-like
renormalization point should also be ruled out.

as pointed out in sect.4, the eective coupling constant shown in
eq.(4.15) which was obtained in the ms scheme is only an approximation
given in the large momentum limit from the viewpoint of conventional per-
turbation theory. why say so? as is well-known, the ms scheme is a mass-
independent renormalization scheme in which the fermion mass is set to
vanish in the process of subtraction. the reasonability of this scheme was
argued as follows1,15 .the fermion propagator can be expanded as a series

according to this expansion, the massive propagator
by the massless one 1
6p. at the same time, the fermion mass, as the coupling
constant, can also be treated as an expansion parameter for the perturba-
tion series. nevertheless, in the mass-dependent renormalization as shown
in this paper, the massive fermion propagator is employed in the calculation
and only the coupling constant is taken to be the expansion parameter of
the perturbation series. thus, in order to get the perturbative result of a
given order of the coupling constant in the mass-dependent renormalization,
according to eq.(6.6), one has to compute an innite number of terms in the
ms scheme. if only the rst term in eq.(6.6) is considered in the ms scheme,
the result derived in the this scheme, comparing to the corresponding one
obtained in the mass-dependent renormalization, can only be viewed as an
approximation given in the large momentum limit . even if in this limit, a
good renormalization scheme should still be required to eliminate the am-
biguity and give an unique result. to this end, we may ask whether there
should exist the dierence between the ms scheme and the ms scheme 2?
as one knows, when the dimensional regularization is employed in the mass-
independent renormalization, the ms scheme only subtracts the divergent
term having the -pole in a feynman integral which is given in the limit
  0 and uses this term to dene the renormalization constant. while, the
ms scheme is designed to include the unphysical terms   ln 4 (here  is

22

2

the euler constant) in the denition of the renormalization constant. the un-
physical terms arise from a special analytical continuation of the space-time
dimension from n to 4. when the two dierent renormalization constants
mentioned above are inserted into the relation e = z 1
3 er, one would derive
a relation between the two dierent renormalized coupling constants given
in the ms and ms schemes if the higher order terms containing the -pole
are ignored. it would be pointed out that the above procedure of leading
to the dierence between the ms and ms schemes is not appropriate be-
cause the procedure is based on direct usage of the divergent form of the
renormalization constants. as emphasized in the introduction, according to
the convergence principle, it is permissible to use such renormalization con-
stants to do a meaningful calculation. the correct procedure of deriving a
renormalized quantity is to solve its rge whose solution is uniquely deter-
mined by the anomalous dimension (other than the renormalization constant
itself) and boundary condition. in computing the anomalous dimension, the
rigorous procedure is to start from the regularized form of the renormaliza-
tion constant. in the regularized form, it is unnecessary and even impossible
to divide a renormalization constant into a divergent part and a convergent
part. since the anomalous dimension is a convergent function of  due to that
the factor 1
 disappears in it, the limit   0 taken after the dierentiation
with respect to the renormalization point would give an unambiguous re-
sult. especially, the unphysical factor (4) (1 + ) appearing in eqs.(3.25),
(3.27) and (4.5) straightforwardly approaches 1 in the limit. therefore, the
unphysical terms   ln 4 could not enter the anomalous dimension and the
eective coupling constant. even if we work in the zero-mass limit or in the
large momentum regime, we have an only way to obtain the eective cou-
pling constant as shown in eq.(4.15) in the one-loop approximation. that is
to say, it is impossible, in this case, to result in the dierence between the
ms and ms schemes and also the dierence between the mom and the ms
schemes.

the above discussions suggest that the ambiguity arising from dierent
renormalization prescriptions may be eliminated by the necessary physical
and mathematical requirements as well as the boundary conditions. it is ex-
pected that the illustration given in this paper for the qed one-loop renor-
malization performed in a mass-dependent scheme would provide a clue on
how to do the qed multi-loop renormalization and how to give an improved
result for the qcd renormalization.

appendix: illustration of the regularization procedure by a

couple of mathematical examples

we believe that if a quantum eld theory is built up on the faithful basis
of physical principles and really describes the physics, a s-matrix element
computed from such a theory is denite to be convergent even though there
occur divergences in the perturbation series of the matrix element. the
occurrence of divergences in the perturbation series, in general, is not to
be a serious problem in mathematics. but, to compute such a series, it is
necessary to employ an appropriate regularization procedure. for example,
for the following convergent integral

f (a) = z 

0

dxeax

(a. 1)

which equals to 1
exponential function

a, if we evaluate it by utilizing the series expansion of the

eax =

(a)n
n!

xn



xn=0

(a. 2)

as we see, the integral of every term in the series is divergent. in this case,
interchange of the integration with the summation actually is not permissible.
when every integral in the series is regularized, the interchange is permitted
and all integrals in the series become calculable. thus, the correct procedure
of evaluating the integral by using the series expansion is as follows

f (a) = lim

this example is somewhat analogous to the perturbation series in the quan-
tum eld theory and suggests how to do the calculation of the series with
the help of a regularization procedure. unfortunately, in practice, we are not
able to compute all the terms in the perturbation series. in this situation, we
can only expect to get desired physical results from a nite order perturba-
tive calculation. how to do it? to show the procedure of such a calculation,
let us look at another mathematical example. the following integral

f (a) = z 

0

dx

e(x+a)
(x + a)2

(a. 4)

where a > 0 is obviously convergent. when the exponential function is
expanded as the taylor series, the integral will be expressed as

clearly, in the above expansion, the rst term is convergent, similar to the
tree-approximate term in the perturbation theory of a quantum eld the-
ory, the second term is logarithmically divergent, analogous to the one-loop-
approximate term and the other terms amount to the higher order corrections
in the perturbation theory which are all divergent. to calculate the integral
in eq.(a.4), it is convenient at rst to evaluate its derivative,

df (a)

(x + a)3 e(x+a)

(a. 6)

which is equal to ea/a2 as is easily seen from integrating it over x by part.
in order to get this result from the series expansion, we have to employ a
regularization procedure. let us dene

f(a) = z

e(x+a)
(x + a)2

then, corresponding to eq.(a.5), we can write

where a0 > 0 is a xed number which should be determined by the boundary

limit    and can be written as

where  is a nite number, eq.(a.12) becomes

f1(a) = ln

this result is nite as long as the parameter  is not taken to be zero and can
be regarded as the contribution of the divergent integral f1(a) appearing in
the second term of eq.(a.5) to the convergent integral f(a). the procedure
described above for evaluating the function f(a) much resembles the renor-
malization group method and the approach proposed in ref.(9). it shows us
how to calculate a nite quantity from its series expansion which contains
divergent integrals.

fig.(1) the one-loop diagrams.

fig.(2) the one-loop eective coupling constants given in the region of
small momenta. the solid curve represents the result obtained at time-like

28

subtraction point. the dashed curve represents the one given at space-like
subtraction point.

fig.(3) the one-loop eective coupling constants for large momenta. the

both curves represent the same ones as in fig.(2).

fig.(4) the one-loop eective electron masses given in the landau gauge

and some other gauges.
