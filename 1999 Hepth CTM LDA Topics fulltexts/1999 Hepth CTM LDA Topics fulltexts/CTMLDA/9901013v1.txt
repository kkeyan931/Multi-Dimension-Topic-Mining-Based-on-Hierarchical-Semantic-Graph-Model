introduction

the physics described the real world by the analysis of results of observations. such description is meaningful,
if the laws of physics do not depend from the methods of observation and the choice of the observers.
therefore, the principle of relativity of observations, which consists in the statement about independence of
the physical laws from a choice of systems of devices, is a general principle, which should satisfy all physical
theories. in this paper we shall consider some measurement procedures and mathematical structures, through
which this universal principle is manifested in classical and quantum physics.

it will be shown that the canonical transformations of hamiltonian dynamics is the transformations of
systems of nonperturbing devices, the unitary transformations of hilbert space of states in quantum physics
are transformations of the systems of perturbing devices. this means that the problem of rst principles
of quantum mechanics can be solved on the basis of taking into account relativity properties of systems of
measuring devices and invariance of fundamental constants hand c [3] which lead to stochastic geometry of
physical space-time.

in preceeding paper [4] some consequences of stochastic treatment of gravitation was considered. in this

paper we show that this treatment can be derived from any general principles.

2 canonical transformations as transformations of the systems of

nonperturbing devices.

in the classical physics the system of coordinates constructed by the help of system of devices which under-
stood as a set of devices allowing to measure a complete set of dynamical variables near the each point of

space. it is supposed, that the basic equations of physics do not depend on a choice of the system of non-
perturbing devices. we shall name this statement as the principle of relativity of nonperturbing observations
(prno).

if the state of the object on the system of nonperturbing devices described by full number of dynam-
ical variables - generalized coordinates and momentum (q, p), and on the other system by another set of
coordinates and momentum (p, q), so according to this principle, the equations of motion not depend on
transition from the rst pair of variables to the second one. we see, that the denition of transformations
of systems of nonperturbing devices is same as the denition of canonical transformations, and therefore, we
can conclude that the canonical invariance of the equations of motion of classical physics is expression of
the principle of relativity of nonperturbing observations. therefore, the description of states of mechanical
objects in systems of nonperturbing devices should be made in phase space, where principle of relativity of
nonperturbing observations expressed as canonical group with symplectical structure.

from this point of view, the applicability of hamiltonian dynamics for various physical structures testied
that the dynamical variables of such physical structures can be measured by system of nonperturbing devices
or they can be reduced to such variables. this interpretation explains the universality of hamiltonian
structures not only in the classical mechanics, but in other elds of physics also.

3 space - time in the systems of perturbing devices.

the existence of plancks constant h as action quantum testies to necessity of extension of the principle of
relativity of observations on the systems of perturbing devices (spd). further we shall be convinced, that
such extension is possible, and moreover, that the quantum theory can be considered as the result of such
extension. here we shall consider the change of structure of space and time in spd.

let we have a system of perturbing devices as the set of classical measurement devices near each point
of space. let during the measurements of coordinates and times of classical particles of small mass, the
particles scattered by devices in each point of trajectories. then, in a general case the trajectories of
observable particles will be similar to brownian trajectories, and the classical mechanics must be replaced
by the theory of brownian motion. the system of perturbing devices here plays a role of environment with
some diusion coecient and the measurements are made in a statistical ensemble of measurements. instead
of coordinates and momentum of particles here we deal with the densities of probabilities and the transition
probabilities.

two kinds of brownian processes are known - usual dissipative (wieners) diusion and nondissipative
(nelsons) diusion [1]. an example of dissipative systems of perturbing devices with wieners diusion can
be wilson and bubble chambers in which high energy particle interacted with atoms of medium along the
trajectory and lose the energy.

at nelsons diusion the energy of an ensemble of particles is conserved and the equations of diusion are
reversible in time in contrary to irreversible wiener processes. here we consider an example of construction
of such conservative systems of devices, in which the motion of particles represents the nelsons diusion
[3]. this is an innity set of massive screens with innity slits on each screen [5]. let the slits have massive
shutters, which opened and closed very short time. in process of opening and closing of shutters sample
particles scattered on this massive shutters. the energy and momentum of shutters and screens not changed
because of elastic scattering of small mass particles. the tangent components of momentum and energies of
particles are changed stochastically but mean values are conserved.

the physical reason for conservative behavior here is the fact, that all elements of measuring devices are
assumed massive (macroscopic) objects, essentially exceeding masses of observable particles. at such ratio
of masses it is possible to consider, that the collisions of classical particles of small mass with very massive
devices is absolutely elastic and that particles scattering is without changing of the energy and the momentum
of devices. the conservation of energy of the ensemble of particles leads to temporary reversibility of the
equations of motions.

thus in spd the structure of space - time becomes stochastic and galilean (or minkowsky) geometry
of space - time is replaced by stochastic geometry. in dissipative spd this is stochastic space - time with
wieners measure, and in nondissipative spd - space-time with nelsons measure .

4 relativity of perturbing observations and transformations of spd.

4 relativity of perturbing observations and transformations of

spd.

here we consider the transformations of spd and the conditions required by the principle of relativity of
observations. an ensemble of particles in spd is described by density of probabilities  (x, t) and transitions
probabilities. in nelsons kinematics there are two family of transitions probabilities p(x, t; x0, t0) which
can be reduced to one function s(x, t) and diusion coecient  [1] (see review [2]). one spd distinguished
by another only by distribution in space transitions probabilities p(x, t; x0, t0) which leads to changing
distribution in space of probabilities density  (x, t). we have for  (x, t) in the rst spd:

and in the second spd:

 (x, t) =z p(x, t; x0, t0)   (x0, t0) dx0

here  is spd transformed density of probability

 (x, t) =z p

(x, t; x0, t0)  (x0, t0)dx0

 (x, t) = b(x, t)   (x, t) = (1 + b)   =  + 

(x, t; x0, t0) = b(x, t)  p(x, t; x0, t0)  b1(x0, t0) =
p

= p + (b  p  p  b0) = p + p,

and b(x, t) is operator of transformations of  (x, t) in changing of spd.
we have from the condition of the probability conservation:

z  (x, t) dx =z  (x, t) dx =z b(x, t)   (x, t) dx = 1

and for small variations

only the form of  (x, t) in space is deformed in such transformations of spd but full probability is

z  (x, t) dx =z b (x, t)   (x, t) dx =b= 0

conserved.

the velocities and diusion coecients of particles in spd, dened as:

they are transformed in spd transformations as (t  0):

r dx0  p(x, t; x0, t0)  (x  x0) = b(x, t)  t

r dx0  p(x, t; x0, t0)  (xi  xi0)  (xj  xj0) = 2n(x, t)ij t
limr dx0  b(x, t)p(x, t; x0, t0)b1(x0, t0)  (x  x0) = b
limr dx0  b(x, t)p(x, t; x0, t0)b1(x0, t0)  (xi  xi0)

(xj  xj0) = 2n

ij(x, t)  dt

(x, t)  dt

it will be shown that for special class of spd, modelling quantum processes, diusion coecients n

ij
can be taken as invariants, u = (b+  b)/2 can be expressed across  (x, t) and that, as result, the spd
transformations can be reduced to the transformations of  (x, t) and v = (b+ + b)/2 :

where s(x, t) is some function, introduced instead of v(x, t) by expression:

 = b  ,

v = (s)/m,

which can be derived from initial lagrangian after special spd transformations [6].
finally, we have a functional phase space by dynamical pair (, s) for particles motion in spd and
corresponding algebra of observables [7] which are exactly equivalent to hilbert space of states and operator
algebra of ordinary quantum mechanics.

5 principle of constancy of action quantum and diusion coe-

cient

in classical mechanics we can choice spd with arbitrary small perturbations and the mean value of the
action function a for classical particle in spd for small time intervals (t  0) is vanished:

limr dx0  p(x, t; x0, t0)  a(x, t, x0, t0) =
= limr dx0  p(x, t; x0, t0) h m(xx0)2
i = 0,

t

(10)

where t = t0  t, x0 = x(t0), x = x(t).
let now exist the action quantum (plancks constant) h which is invariant under transformations of
spd. this statement we will call as principle of constancy of action quantum [3]. if the mean value of a
become equal to hin one of spd, then it will be equal to hin all other spd. so, the expressions:

limz dx0  p(x, t; x0, t0) " m  (x  x0)2

t

# = h

and

limz dx0b(x, t)p(x, t; x0, t0)b1(x0, t0)" m  (x  x0)2

t

# = h

(11)

(12)

are invariants under b transformations of spd. we see that as consequence of this principle the mean
value of a dont vanished at t  0. thus we obtain spd covariant formula for mean square values of
coordinates of particles:

limz dx0  p

(x, t; x0, t0)  (x  x0)2 = 

h
m

dt = 2  dt,

(13)

where diusion coecient  = h/2m is same as in stochastic formulation of quantum mechanics (stochas-
tic mechanics) [1]. but in stochastic mechanics the value of diusion coecient given equal  = h/2m by
hand, whereas in our case this formula is consequence of the rst principles.

6 quantum principle of equivalence

in nelsons stochastic mechanics we have diusion coecient with inertial mass s = h/2min. the picture of
particles movement treated here as movement of the classical particle with inertial mass min in stochastic
space, which described as some background with conservative nelsons diusion.

it is important, that the mass parameter in diusion coecient of spd d = h/2min also is inertial mass

min, determined by kinetic term of action function and describing scattering of particles on spd.

in quantum mechanics, reformulating in terms of stochastic processes, we have diusion coecient q =
h/2mq, where mq is some mass parameter, determining uctuations of coordinates of quantum particles in
at and regular galilean space and time [8]. l.smolin shows from analysis of lamb shift data that the
quantum diusion mass mq is equal to the inertial mass with high accuracy [8]:

therefore, two kind of mass of particle are equal

(min  mq)/min  1013

(14)

and this fact is very important for understanding of geometrical nature of quantum phenomena.
firstly this means the equivalence of the motion of classical particle in spd with ordinary smooth space,
and, the motion of classical particle in stochastic mechanics with nonperturbing devices and stochastic back-
ground. this fact also means the equivalence of the transition to spd and quantum mechanical description
(quantization) of the motion of classical particle.

we can demonstrate this situation in the simple double slit experiment. let we have the source and the
detector of the particles and between them exist the screen with two slits. the particles emitted by source
and after penetrating across slits, registered by detectors. after many times repeating of experiment the
observer obtain the interference picture on the detectors. the observer, which have only photographic plate
with interference picture, dont distinguished dierence between three interpretations:

a) space is empty and smooth (classical) space, but particles have quantum properties (wave function),

which leads to interference (quantum mechanics);

b) space is empty, but not smooth and its stochastic, and the motion of the classical particles on this

background leads to interference (stochastic machanics);

c) space is smooth, classical, but not empty and exist innity set of devices near each point of space, the
classical particles interact with this medium of devices and as result, the observer detect interference picture
at nal time (relativity of observations).

further we call this fact as quantum principle of equivalence [3]. can we conclude from this statements
that quantum mechanics is the stochastic geometry of space-time and that stochastic mechanics is true
physical formulation of quantum mechanics? is the real space-time stochastic?

for the answer to these questions we reminded the analogous situation in einsteins proof of geometrical
nature of gravitation. since the equality of inertial and gravitational masses in general relativity we also
have indistinguishability for observer of three situations in explaining of acceleration of sample particle:

a) space-time is euclidean, reference frame is inertial, but exist gravitational eld with potential  (eld

picture);

b) space-time is riemannian, reference frame is inertial, and not any external eld (geometric picture);
c) space-time is euclidean in inertial systems, but our reference frame is accelerated and not any external

eld (general relativity).

after analyzing this situations in general relativity the geometrical theory of gravitation was established.
analogously, we can conclude, that quantum principle of equivalence allowed us justied the stochastic
geometrical theory of quantum uctuations and we can conclude that quantum mechanics is nothing but
the stochastic geometry of space-time.

7 conclusions.

the rst conclusion of the paper is the statement that the principle of relativity of nonperturbing observations
in classical physics represented by the group of canonical transformations and the hamiltonian dynamics.

the second conclusion is the fact that the group of unitary transformations of quantum mechanics can

be considered as representation of the principle of relativity of perturbing observations.

and nally, we demonstrate the possibility of derivation of quantum mechanics from general principles
of invariance and, as result, we can conclude, that the real space-time is stochastic and quantum mechanics
is the correct description the geometry of this stochastic space-time.
