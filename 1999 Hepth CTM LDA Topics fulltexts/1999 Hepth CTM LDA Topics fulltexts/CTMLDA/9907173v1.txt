abstract

we derive a perturbative scheme to treat the interaction between point sources
and ads-gravity. the interacting problem is equivalent to the search of a polydromic
mapping x a = x a(x) , endowed with o(2, 2) monodromies, between the physical
coordinate system and a minkowskian 4-dimensional coordinate system, which is how-
ever constrained to live on a hypersurface. the physical motion of point sources is
therefore mapped to a geodesic motion on this hypersurface. we impose an instan-
taneous gauge which induces a set of equations dening such a polydromic mapping.
their consistency leads naturally to the einstein equations in the same gauge. we
explore the restriction of the monodromy group to o(2, 1), and we obtain the solution
of the elds perturbatively in the cosmological constant.

1 introduction

the scattering of particles in gravity is one of the typical problems of physics, from the times
relativity theory has been discovered [1]-[2]-[3]-[4]. our scheme of solution [5]-[6]-[7]-[8] is
based on introducing the constants of motion of the problem by allowing for a polydromic
mapping x a = x a(x) of the at metric, whose polydromy automatically builds up the
delta singularities of the particles energy-momentum tensors.

thanks to this mapping the physical motion can be trivialized to an elementary motion,
which in the case of pure gravity reduces to a free motion on a plane, while, as it has been
shown in [9], in the case of ads gravity reduces to a geodesic motion of a hyper-surface
immersed in a at 4-dimensional minkowskian space-time with signature ( + + - - ). in the
last scheme we can unify not only particle-like singularities, moving as time-like geodesics,
but also bt z black-hole singularities [10]-[11]-[12]-[13], moving as space-like geodesics.

in this article we restrict such a mapping problem in a particular gauge, the instantaneous
gauge dened by the equations gzz = 0 and k = 0, which has allowed to compute, in the
case of pure (2 + 1)-gravity [6], the elds in terms of analytic and anti-analytic functions.
our aim is to show how this scheme can be extended to the case of (2 + 1) ads-gravity
[14]-[15], although we are not able to solve completely for the elds. our method at least
gives a framework in which it is possible to obtain perturbatively an unique answer.

such a polydromic mapping is constrained by the gauge choice to satisfy a complete set
of equations governing this immersion in the at 4-dimensional space-time. this system of
equations is related to the gauge choice and is valid only for those regions of space-time
consistent with the conformal gauge. an obvious counterexample is the case of the region of
the black hole internal to the horizon, whose metric is too complex to satisfy such a choice.

the rst-order formalism is simpler than the second-order formalism, as it allows to avoid
distributions, related to the singularities and it instead introduces polydromies which take
into account globally the presence of the particles.

in this sense sources are viewed as singularities of the elds once that the monodromy
conditions are imposed around them. the particles scattering is then reduced to a composi-
tion of monodromies, that, in the case of o(2, 2) monodromy group, produces two invariant
masses [9], determining the solution at great distances. in the particular case of zero angular
momentum, these two invariant masses coincide between them and the monodromy group
is restricted to o(2, 1) ( see also [16] ). in such a case it is useful to introduce a parameteri-
zation that reduces the cut to a mobius transformation. however we are not able, as in the
gravity case, to nd a parameterization of the elds in terms of analytic functions, and here

1

the problem seems quite involved, being the equations for the x a coordinates non-analytic.

it is however possible to solve for the cuts with non-analytic functions, since the non-
analytic part can be perturbatively represented as a nite number of terms, obtained as
products of analytic and anti-analytic functions.
it remains an arbitrariness of analytic
functions in the naive integration that is removed imposing that the whole solution satises
the monodromies. we obtain therefore, order by order in perturbation theory, a eld satis-
fying all the requirements and depending from the constants of motion, which describe the
particles motion. we nally discuss the limits of such research to the study of black holes
scattering.

2 instantaneous gauge in the second order formalism

the splitting adm of space-time in terms of space-like surfaces can be derived from the
einstein-hilbert action with negative cosmological constant ( with modulus  ) rewriting
the scalar curvature r(3) in its spatial part r(2), intrinsic to the surfaces (t), and an extrinsic
part, coming from the embedding, as follows ( 8g = 1 )

s = 
where the equivalence is true apart from a surface term. here we have introduced the
extrinsic curvature tensor kij, o second fundamental form of the surface (t), given by

2z p|g|[r(2) +(t rk)2t r(k 2)]+z p|g|. (2.1)

1

2z p|g|r(3) +z p|g| = 
2s|gij|

kij =

1

(2.2)

|g| (cid:16)(2)

i g0j + (2)

j g0i  0gij(cid:17) ,

with the notation that the spatial indices are raised or lowered with the spatial part of the
metric gij and its inverse.

let us choose as parameterization for the metric, once that it is constrained to be in

conformal gauge gzz = 0:

g00 = 2  e2,

g0z =

1
2

e2,

gzz = 

1
2

e2.

(2.3)

let us compute the trace of the extrinsic curvature tensor and pose it equal to zero, in such
a way that all the dependences on time derivatives are avoided in the action :

k(z, z, t) = kzz =

1
2

(zg0z + zg0z  0gzz) = 0.

(2.4)

the other part of the tensor kij can be shown to be a meromorphic analytic function,

as we shall see in a moment from the equations of motion

kzz = n(z) =

e2
2

z.

(ti),

(i = 1, 2, ..., n).

(2.8)

the condition of instantaneous gauge ( see also [6] ) is therefore dened by

gzz = k = 0.

(2.6)

combining the conditions above, we obtain a new action without temporal derivatives,
showing that the propagation of the elds , ,  can be made instantaneous. adding the
matter coupling (i.e. a set of n particles ), the equations of ads-gravity have as sources both
the cosmological constant that can be thought as the mean eect of an uniform distribution
of matter and the energy-momentum tensor of the external particles:

2 +

2 zz = 2 + 4nn e2 = e2  |g|e2t 00

z(cid:19) = zn(z) = (4)1|g|(t 0z  t 00)
2
e2
2 zz = 2  8nn e2 = 2e2 + 1|g|(t zz  t 0z  t 0z + t 00),
(2.7)

2  2

where 2  4zz denotes the laplacian, and the energy-momentum tensor for the particles
is given by

avoiding time derivatives allows to treat the particle motion as an external independent
datum, from which the metric has a parametric dependence, while only by imposing both the
monodromies and the boundary conditions one obtains constraints on the geodesic motion
of the particles.

with the introduction of the conformal gauge gzz = 0 the einstein equations for the
corresponding components of the ricci tensor r are missing in eq. (2.7), and should be
added as a constraint,i.e.

rzz = tzz.

(2.9)

these two constraints, together with the gauge condition k = 0, are indeed equivalent to the
covariant conservation of the energy-momentum tensor, which in turn implies the geodesic
equations, as shown in ref. [6].

3 comparison with the rst-order formalism

the introduction of the cosmological constant makes useless searching for a simplication of
the equations of motion in the dreibein formalism [14], while it is fruitful to start from the

3

typical construction of space-times with constant curvature [10]-[11], that are obtained from
a 4-dimensional at metric with a constraint between the coordinates:

ds2 = dx adx bab

x axa =

1


.

(3.1)

this formalism can also be considered a rst-order formalism, dening a new dreibein ea
x a, in which the lorentz index depends on four coordinates.

 =

from the constraint (3.1) we can easily deduce the following properties:

x azxa = 0 x a0xa = 0.

if we suddenly impose the conformal gauge, i.e.

gzz = zx a  zxa = 0

gzz = zx a  zxa = 

1
2

e2,

many other properties of the x a-mapping are shown to be valid.

(3.2)

(3.3)

an intrinsic local frame of the four-dimensional space-time is given by these 4 four-vectors

x a, zx a, zx a, and v a, dened as

v a = 2ie2abcdxbzxczxd

(3.4)

that is orthogonal to the rst three ones, and is dened to have norm equal to unity. instead
zx a and zx a are two null vectors that have a non-vanishing scalar product between them.
we can easily check the following property:

0x a = zx a  zx a + v a.

(3.5)

therefore once that the mapping problem x a is solved at xed time, we can also determine
the eld  and , while the knowledge of the eld  doesnt require to compute any time
derivative on the mapping.

in the second order formalism we have chosen an instantaneous gauge, which is the same
that we have use to solve the n-body problem in pure (2 + 1)-gravity, and it is dened by
the conditions in eq. (2.6). these gauge conditions combined together imply that :

zzx a =


2

e2x a.

(3.6)

in particular, the k = 0 condition implies that additional terms proportional to v a are
absent in the r.h.s. of eq. (3.6).

let us compute 2

z x a. we can develop it in the basis of four-vectors

z x a = c0x a + c1zx a + c2zx a + c3v a.
2

(3.7)

4

it is easy to see that c0 = 0 and c2 = 0 are consequences of the eqs. (3.2) and (3.3). the
scalar product with zx a implies that c1 = 2z, while c3 can be constrained since it satises
the analyticity condition:

zc3 = 0,

(3.8)

therefore c3 = c3(z) is a monodromic analytic function. the only candidate for such a
function is the meromorphic function n(z), previously identied as the kzz component of
the extrinsic curvature tensor; in fact, starting from the denition (2.5) of n(z) we can show
that c3 = n(z). therefore we nd the equation:

2
z x a = 2zzx a + n(z)v a.

(3.9)

now let us compute zv a. from the denition of v a we can suddenly notice that zv a is
orthogonal both to v a and x a. we can therefore pose

zv a = a1zx a + a2zx a.

(3.10)

introducing eq. (3.9) in the computation of (3.10) we can directly nd zv a, and obtain
that:

zv a = 2e2n(z)zx a.

(3.11)

in summary, since we work in an instantaneous gauge, the equations at xed time of the
immersion x a = x a(x) are given by:

zzx a =


2

e2 x a

2
z x a = 2zzx a + n(z)v a
zv a = 2e2n(z)zx a.

(3.12)

the consistency of these equations leads to the elds equations (2.7) in the second-order
formalism.

let us also notice the following property,i.e., that, being x a and v a two vectors of
constant norm, their dynamics can be described by a sigma model o(2, 2), as a consequence
of the equations (3.12)

zzx a = (zx bzxb))x a
zzv a = (zv bzvb))v a.

(3.13)

both eqs. (3.12) and (3.13) are automatically covariant with respect to the o(2, 2) cuts,
that can be decomposed as products of su(1, 1) cuts, as shown in ref. [9]. in general, the
one-particle cut can be identied as ( x a = (x t, x

, x z, x

) )

z

t

  x t x z

t !   a1 b1

b1 a1 !  x t x z

t !  a2 b2
b2 a2 !

x

z

(3.14)

where the entries ai and bi of the monodromy matrices are given by:

a1 = cos  ich(1  2)sin
b1 = iei(+)sh(1  2)sin
a2 = cos + ich(1 + 2)sin
b2 = iei()sh(1 + 2)sin.

(3.15)

in general the solution of the two-body problem can be obtained in global terms. the
result of the composition of two monodromies, in the case of particles, is of course of the
type:

  xt xz

x

x

z

t ! = ml  x t x z

t ! mr,

x

z

x

(3.16)

where to the ml, mr matrices it is possible to associate the corresponding invariant masses
[4]:

cos(ml) = cos(1)cos(2) 

cos(mr) = cos(1)cos(2) 

1  p l
p l
2
m1m2
p r
1  p r
2
m1m2

sin(1)sin(2)

sin(1)sin(2)

(3.17)

and we have dened the following vectors, constants of motion:

p l
1 = m1l
p r
1 = m1r

1 (1, vl
1 )
1 (1, vr
1 )

l
1 = ch(1  2) l
r
1 = ch(1 + 2) r

1 = ei(+)sh(1  2)
1 vl
1 vr
1 = ei()sh(1 + 2).

(3.18)

for generic values of the constants of motions, the left invariant mass ml will be dierent
from the right invariant mass mr and therefore the composed system has spin, other than
invariant mass.

in the simplied case in which a1 = a2 = a, b1 = b2 = b, that correspond to null
angular momentum, it is useful to parameterize the x a transformation in the following way,
that makes explicit the reduction of monodromies from the generic case of o(2, 2) to the
particular case of o(2, 1) ( x a = (x 0, x 1, x z, x

) )

in which the only polydromic variable is z, transforming as o(2, 1) around the particles

z 

az + b
bz + a

.

(3.20)

exploring the consequences of eqs. (3.12) we nd that there are two eqs. with a laplacian
for the t and z variables:

zzt = 2sint cost  zzzz + zzzz
2sintzzzz

(1  zz)

2

zzz +

2zzzzz
(1  zz)

=

!
(cid:18)qzzzz +qzzzz(cid:19) .

the rst one is integrated by the following rst integral,

zt =

2pzzzz

1  zz

cost,

that is also obtained developing the condition of null norm zx a  zxa = 0.

the second one is integrated solving the eqs. (3.12) in terms of n(z):

(3.21)

(3.22)

n(z) =

1

 pzzzz pzzzz

pzzzz +pzzzz! e2

cost

z(e2zsint ).

(3.23)

using these rst integrals we can express the conformal factor e2 in such a way that

makes explicit its invariance under o(2, 1):

e2 =

 pzzzz pzzzz

(1  zz)

!2

cos2t.

(3.24)

this method appears to be more involved than the second-order formalism, however the
latter one would require to analyze in detail all the various contributions, of distribution
type, while introducing the cuts allows to avoid to write down mathematically ill-dened
equations.

4 perturbative expansion in  for two-body scattering

let us rstly recall the single body metric, which is dened in the radial gauge as

ds2 = ((1  )2 + r2)dt2 

dr2

(1  )2 + r2  r2d2

(4.1)

7

this metric can be expressed as a polydromic mapping

x t = x 0 + ix 1 =

.

r2

(1  )2 ei(1)t

(4.2)

introducing the spatial conformal gauge gzz = 0, which is obtained with a radial coordinate
transformation

,

(4.3)

the x a-mapping becomes

x t =

x z =

.

(4.4)

in conformal gauge it appears a physical limit on the radial coordinate, implying that the
solution is dened on a disk instead on the whole z-plane, and it is given by r1  2

.

before starting the study of particles scattering, let us analyze in detail the one-body

problem. firstly, we can say that n(z) = 0, implying by consistency with eq. (3.23) that

e2zsint = c(t)z.

(4.5)

from the one-body problem solution (4.4), the following expressions for t and z have been
obtained in [9]



2(cid:18) 1 + a2

sint = a

therefore we can x the time-dependent constant of eq. (4.5) as

c(t) =



2(1  )

a(t).

(4.6)

(4.7)

this solution is not valid with the choice of the parameterization (3.19) in the whole
disk, but only in a subset dened by the condition |z|  1, that in the case of a single body

8

is also a disk in the physical coordinates dened by

r2(1)

1  a(t)
1 + a(t)
1 + a(t)
1  a(t)

for a(t) > 0

for a(t) < 0.

(4.8)

at the limiting value, the x a mapping reduces to  = (1 ). the continuation of z-eld
outside the physical region meets another region, disconnected from the physical one, in
which the condition |z|  1 is valid. in this specular universe there is also an image of the
source. in the two-body case this image will remain an isolated singularity, whose cut will
be identied with the composition of the two-body cut.

let us notice that this limit on the coordinates is not perturbative in  and that at each
order of the perturbative expansion this limit can be considered . only after re-summing
the perturbative series, we can understand what is precisely the domain of the exact solution,
from which it must be continued with another choice of the parameterization, instead of eq.
(3.19).

with respect to the geodesic motion of a test particle situated in (t), under the inuence
of a mass source situated in the origin of the coordinates, the knowledge of this patch is
enough to give the complete solution, if the z-value corresponding to (t) has modulus less
than unity:

z() = th()

r1 =

1

p1  a2(t)(cid:18)z() +

1

z()(cid:19) s(cid:18)z() +

1

z()(cid:19)2

 4(1  a2(t)) .(4.9)

the resulting motion is limited on a line, similar to the harmonic motion, and the test
particle can meet the source after a nite time t0.

to introduce the two-body problem, it is useful to give the explicit development of eq.

(4.6) at the rst orders:


2

r2(1) + o(2)(cid:19)

if we compare the exact non-perturbative limit (4.8) with what is given by the rst order
approximation. i.e.

|z (0)| = 1  r2(1) 

4


(4.11)

we note that the correct value is almost obtained, and that the following perturbative terms
give only relatively small corrections.

to describe the scattering of point sources the monodromies must be non-abelian between

them, in such a way that their xed points are distinct for each particle:

z 1

a1z + b1

z + a1

a2z + b2

(4.12)

(4.14)

let us do the case of head-on collision, choosing the coecients given in eq. (4.13) in the
following way

a1 = cos1  i1sin1
b1 = i1|v1|sin1

a2 = cos2  i2sin2

b2 = i2|v2|sin2.

(4.15)

we can parameterize the coecients only in terms of rapidities, without extra phases, i.e.

1 = ch(21)
1|v1| = sh(21)

2 = ch(22)
2|v2| = sh(22).

the system is dened non perturbatively by an invariant mass m characterizing the
system at great distances as a one-body metric. speaking of limit of great distances is a
little misleading since the metric in conformal gauge is valid only on a nite size region,
however in a perturbative expansion, the limit coming from re-summing the perturbative
series is not visible.

the invariant mass dened by

cosm = cos1cos2  ch((1 + 2))sin1sin2,

(4.19)

is a real number included between 0 and 1, implying some non-perturbative limits on the
values of the constants of motion:

ch((1 + 2)) 

1 + cos1cos2

sin1sin2

.

(4.20)

in the computation of the perturbative elds it is useful to verify that the perturbative
terms can be recombined to give m, conrming that the complete solution, which we are
not able to give explicitly, is deeply dependent on it. in fact, as in the one-body case there
is another singularity, characterizing the z-eld at innity in the unphysical region, whose
mass must be identied with m, as we shall see later on.

before analyzing the two-body problem, we must notice that the cosmological constant
produces by itself a sort of background eld, which is obtained in the massless limit   0:

(4.21)

therefore at each order the development of the background metric gives rise to a contribution,
which is divergent at innity. this is made smoother by the presence of the sources, that
at innity are seen as a unique central body with total mass given by the invariant mass
m. since we have to x the boundary conditions we choose to require that the analytic
functions that naturally arise from the integration are regular around the particles and have
a behavior at innity that is no more divergent than a one-body metric with the mass given
by the invariant mass m:

the fact that it is possible to relate the physical distance 12 in terms of the bosonic distance
z (0)(1)  z (0)(0), is connected with the requirement that the mapping z (0) reduces to the
identity mapping z in the massless limit.

in practice, from the one body case, we can deduce what is the approximate gure of the

patch on which the solution is valid, dened by the equation

2

=

|z (0)|

.

(4.28)

if we insist too much on the validity of eq. (4.28), we nd some perturbative limit on the
constant of motion i  2
, which really doesnt exist, and therefore we deduce that this
approximate equation is valid only for small values of i. however more subtle limits on
the constants of motion appear if we require that the asymptotical behavior is related to a
particle, and not to a tachyon, as shown in eq. (4.20).

let us rewrite the zero order solution in terms of an hypergeometric function:

d1(1  )2 + k1

z (0) = k2z 

= k2

0
 11
1  1

f (2, 1  1, 2  1; ) + k1

 z112.

(4.29)

the analytic part of the solution for z can be directly generalized at all orders representing
it as a ratio of hyper-geometric functions

, 1 + m  1 + 2

ez = coth((1 + 2))  11ef(cid:18)m  1 + 2
ef(cid:18)1 + m + 1 + 2
where the symbol ef denotes a novel normalization of the hyper-geometric function ( see also

, 2  1; (cid:19)

(4.31)

more generally, the solution will be dened by a lorentz transformation in order to produce
the right xed points of the z-monodromy

,

(4.32)

z = ez + z(0)
1 + z(0)ez

which, in the special case of head-on collision, become

z(0) = 

1v1
1 + 1

= th(1) z(1) =

2v2
1 + 2

= th(2)

ez(1) = th((1 + 2)).

(4.33)

it is easy to verify that the rst order solution ( eq. (4.29) ) is obtained with the following

limit on the invariant mass

  0  m  1 + 2 + 2(1 + 2)2 sin1sin2

sin(1 + 2)

+ o(2)

(4.34)

once that the particular values of head-on collision are substituted. from the denition of
the hyper-geometric function it is clear that there is another singularity at innity, specular
to the ones situated in  = 0 and  = 1, whose cut is related to the invariant mass m.

the scale 12 appear to be undetermined in the exact analytic solution. as in the lowest
order in , corresponding to pure gravity, there is no way to determine it unless we require
that the solution respects a given asymptotic behavior, as we have discussed before deriving
eqs. (3.21) and (3.22).

13

to give the contribution to the geodesic equations, it is useful to make an asymptotic

development of the z solution in the limit   :



a1 + a2 1m
a3 + a4 1m

,

ez

with the coecients dened as:
a1 = coth((1 + 2))
(b  c + 1)(a  b)

a3 =

(b)(a  b)

(c  b)
a4 =

(1  b)
a = m  1 + 2

a2 = coth((1 + 2))

(a  c + 1)(b  a)

(1  a)

b = 1 + m  1 + 2

2

c = 2  1.

(4.36)

this development can be put in the form of a lorentz transformation with respect to the
static case

p1 ea2(t)

where we have taken into account the fact that the asymptotic metric contains terms depen-

dent explicitly on time (ea(t) = sin((1  m)t) ). the solution for the scale 12 becomes

then:

(4.38)

1m12 =

2p1 ea2(t)



a2
a3

as the following identity a1a2 = a3a4 is valid.

at the next order 2 we nd that the eld time dependence comes directly from the
equations of motion and not only from the boundary conditions. to compute its contribution
we must rst know t (1).

from the asymptotic behavior ( eqs. (4.22) and (4.23) ) we deduce that:

instead, the equation of motion for t (1) can be integrated giving

t (0) = (1  mt).

zt (1) =

t (0)
2

zz (0)(z

(0)

+ h()).

(4.39)

(4.40)

in the limit i  0 we impose that the contribution of the extra function h() vanishes,
so to recover the background eld (4.21). let us dene h() in such a way that zt (1) is a
meromorphic function, which therefore requires that the combination z
+ h() transforms
as zz
under all monodromies, from which we deduce the monodromy properties of h()
as follows:

(0)

(0)

h() k e2ik h() + 4i()kkeik sink

(4.41)

14

adding the condition that h()  0 in the limit of small masses, i  0, we obtain the

solution, perturbative in the mass parameters,

h()  211log + 222log(1  ).

(4.42)

this behavior, divergent around the particles, is still acceptable, because the logarithmic
divergence is cancelled by z-integration and t (1) is again well dened around the particles.

let us also notice that in the case of one particle h() is constrained by

h()

20
 21(1  cz1).

hence the solution for t (1) must be for one particle with rapidity 1 6= 0,

(0)

+ 21)  21c(1  1)(z + z)i + t (1)(t).

t (1) =

t (0)

2 h(z (0) + 21)(z
h() = a1z 

1

we can generalize eq. (4.42) to the case of any masses choosing h() as

d 1(1  )21.
the monodromy conditions (4.41) are satised by the following positions:

d 11(1  )2 + a2z 

0

a1 = 

21

b(1, 1 + 2)

a2 = 

22

b(1 + 1, 2)

,

that in the small mass limit reproduces the solution (4.42).

therefore we can dene the integrated eld t (1) as

(4.43)

(4.44)

(4.45)

(4.46)

t (1) =

k = 1, 2.

(4.47)

we have added the second line to make explicit the property that t (1) is automatically
monodromic around both particles, without need to introduce logarithmic terms to adjust
an eventual translation monodromy, which fortunately is absent.

starting from the knowledge of t (1) we can deduce, using the rst integral (3.18) con-

straints for the solution of the z (2) eld,

zz (2) =

(zt (1))

(0) =

zz

(z (0) + h())

this rst integral is automatically solution of the perturbative expansion of eq. (3.17),

which remains also non linear in the unknown zz (2) after the development in :

zzz (2) = t (0)zz (0)qzz

(0)

zz (2).

the other rst integral, which is relative to n(z), gives at the lowest order in :

(4.49)

(4.50)

and we check that is a meromorphic function with simple poles.

the solution for z (2) can be decomposed in an analytic part and a non-analytic one,

satisfying eq. (4.48):

z (2) = z (2)

a (z) + z (2)

n (z, z)

(4.51)

while the analytic part z (2)
(4.30), the non-analytic part must satisfy only the homogeneous part of the monodromies

a (z) is determined by the development of the general solution

z (2)

n (z, z)

k e2ik z (2)

n (z, z).

(4.52)

when we integrate zz (2) we have at disposition an arbitrary polydromic function f (z),

to be xed in order to make z (2)

n (z, z) again covariant under the rule (4.52).

a possible solution is

(4.58)

to match the background metric (4.21) we can always add to the particular solution f0(z)
terms of the type:

f (z) = f0(z) + (a + bw + cw2) 1(1  )2.

(4.59)

at the level of geodesic equations we notice that the condition (4.33) is solved for an
arbitrary scale 12 and that it doesnt give rise to new constraints, while the criterium of
reproducing a certain asymptotic behavior is already satised by the rst order of eq. (4.38),
i.e. by eq. (4.27). if we continue perturbation theory it is possible that other constraints
result from the requirement that the residue of the simple poles of n(z) has the following
form, valid at all orders:

n(z)  (12)1m(cid:18)a1(t)



+

a2(t)

(4.60)

with the invariant mass m that replaces the sum of masses.

we cannot forget that we are treating a particular case of scattering at zero angular
momentum, in which the particles have to collide after a nite time. this case is typically
ill-dened from the distributional point of view, as in the solution products of distributions
are expected to appear at a certain time, while the geodesic limit is still well dened. a
verication of the consistency of this solution can be made with a perturbative computation
at non-vanishing angular momentum, in which case it is no more possible to reduce the
general o(2, 2) monodromies to o(2, 1).

5 conclusions

we have deduced the general equations for the immersion x a that governs the scattering of
point sources coupled to ads-gravity. we have found the complete solution for the analytic
part of the elds and a partial one for the non-analytic part. the choice of conformal gauge
allows to study the scattering problem with instantaneous propagation of the elds avoiding
the diculties connected with the retarded potentials. this gauge is globally dened for the
scattering of particles, but it is not for what concerns the scattering of black holes, where
its validity is reduced to the region external to the horizons.

the scattering of particles is governed by the composition of monodromies, which gives
rise to two invariant masses [9] ; someone may object that these are not relevant for the
solution of the elds, since in conformal gauge there is a physical limit on the values of spatial
coordinates and it is not possible to see the particles as a unique body at great distance from
them. however such a limit is non-perturbative with respect to the cosmological constant
and at a perturbative level the elds do have innite extension, and the leading contribution
at great distances of each perturbative order must be dominated by these two invariant
masses, which in our particular case of head-on collision coincide. the physical scale is
produced only re-summing the perturbative series. at a non-perturbative level, the two
invariant masses are still present, since in the non-physical region of the z eld it appears a
specular image of the n-body system with an unique singularity, dened by the two invariant
masses. therefore, at least mathematically, this extra singularity is important to give the
parameterization of the solution.

it would be interesting to continue our study to include the scattering of bt z black holes
, where the equations (3.12) still remain valid outside their horizons. a similar problem has
already an analogy with the case of the scattering of spinning particles in (2 + 1)-gravity [8],
in which the problem of closed time-like curves produces, in conformal gauge, some ct c
horizons around the particles. work is in progress in this direction.
