eigenstates {|qi} - orthogonal localized around dierent values q, sense maximal localization state vanishing uncertainty q. reason unsharp real degrees freedom occur that, priori, real entity quantized theory may correspond operator whose expectation values real - and, crucially, operators whose expectation values real need self- adjoint: recall operator whose expectation values real symmetric oper- ator. nite dimensional hilbert spaces, symmetric operators self-adjoint self-adjoint operators symmetric. innite dimensional hilbert spaces, sym- metric operators need self-adjoint. also means need possess spectral resolution diagonalization. consequence, operator q whose expectation values real may also describe degree freedom fuzzy unsharp, sense minimum value q may larger zero, and/or vectors realize minimum value q may orthogonal. 3 simple example nonrelativistic quantum mechanics momentum operator p particle box. simplicity, let us consider case one dimension, particle conned, e.g., interval : recall physical wave functions (x) vanish boundary box momentum operator p acts physical wave functions derivative oper- ator p = ihx. indeed, p example merely symmetric operator: clearly, expectation values p real, therefore p symmetric. hand, p self-adjoint. plane waves vanish boundaries therefore physical states. means plane waves domain p, implies p eigenbasis spectral resolution. consequence, p indeed unsharp: uncertainty relation, since x surely smaller 2l, expect minimum uncertainty momentum larger zero. indeed, precise minimum value p pmin = h/2l. discuss example detail below. general, example candidate theory fundamental theory quan- tum gravity, appears reasonable1 assume entities described classical theory real variables described quantized theory operators linear whose expectation values real. course, cannot assume operators observables usual quantum mechanical sense, even act space states. instead, operators may act hilbert space elds, branes (as briey discuss below), indeed abstract hilbert space. level generality say real degrees freedom may described self-adjoint operators, others may described merely symmetric operators - correspondingly real physical entities correspond sharp unsharp. interestingly, however, exists limited number types sharpness unsharpness, short-distance structures, occur operators whose expectation values real, i.e. symmetric operators. classication outlined {$9810215$}: since class symmetric operators includes self-adjoint operators, two possible short distance structures lattices continua, corresponding fact self-adjoint operators occur discrete continuous spectra. ex- treme purely unsharp cases. described class simple symmet- ric operators. operators symmetric self-adjoint, even invariant subspace. exist subclasses operators describe dierent types unsharpness. {$9810215$}, divided two broad classes, fuzzy-a fuzzy-b. technically, two classes correspond two possibilities deciency indices equal unequal. present paper, concerned operators describe entities 1 consider alternative possibility nonlinear operators. 4 unsharp type fuzzy-a. mathematically, simple symmetric operators equal deciency indices. example, momentum operator particle box type fuzzy-a. indeed theoretical indications short-distance structures type fuzzy-a occur description space-time planck scale: various theoretical arguments long indicated space-time displays funda- mental foaminess, see , unsharpness small lengths. particular, several studies, see e.g. -{$9810215$}, suggest structure space-time planck scale, string scale, characterized eectively correction terms uncertainty relations and, particular, corrections type: xp h 2 (1 + k (p )2 + ...) (3) easily veried, k > 0, eq.3 implies existence nite lower bound x, namely: xmin = hk (4) here, k assumed small positive constant related planck scale, string theory string scale. remark recent studies (on large extra dimensions seen gravity only) suggest unication and/or planck scale may even low tev scale, see e.g.{$9810215$}. positive minimum uncertainty xmin > 0 arising uncertainty relations type eq.3 introduced ultraviolet cuto quantum eld theories . also shown type cuto may solve transplanckian energy paradox black hole radiation, see {$9810215$}. general reviews quantum gravity - string theory motivations eq.3, see e.g. . recent discussion potential origins eq.3 see e.g. {$9810215$}, path integral approach modied uncertainty relations see {$9810215$}. technically, clear operator x obeys uncertainty relation type eq.3 cannot possess eigenvectors, since uncertainty x would vanish eigenvectors. therefore, operator x symmetric self- adjoint. precisely, must type fuzzy-a, rst shown {$9810215$}. remark operator realizations functional analysis uncertainty relations type eq.3 rst discussed {$9311147$}. hand, study cases real degree freedom represented self-adjoint instead merely symmetric operator, must also address fact self-adjoint operators often play two roles, namely real degrees freedom also generators symmetries. therefore, question arises, whether, how, merely symmetric operators could also involved generating symmetries. indeed, known important dierence respect self-adjoint merely symmetric operators. namely, merely 5 symmetric operators, unlike self-adjoint operators, generate unitaries, least directly. present paper, therefore consider fuzzy-a type operators respect generation unitary transformations - nd operators possess remarkable property: denition, fuzzy-a type operators operators q physical domain dq = dphys simple symmetric equal deciency indices. operator exists family operators {q()} coincide q physical domain dq self-adjoint. q() therefore generate unitaries usual way. claim q() - recall coincide q physical domain - generate, together, unitary operators hilbert space. shows that, way, operators type fuzzy-a indeed relate aspects symmetries hilbert space act. also nd result supports conjecture made . conjecture proposes mechanism small wavelengths cut case fuzzy-a short-distance structure eectively turn internal degrees freedom isospinor structure unitary groups act. 2 examples unsharp degrees freedom discuss theorem, let us introduce concrete examples simple symmetric operators theorem apply. 2.1 momentum particle box already mentioned example momentum operator p = ix particle box (from set h = 1). since later use example also illustrate new theorem generating symmetries, let us discuss case detail: assume box one-dimensional interval . due conning box potential, physical wave functions (x) dphys h = l2(l, l) vanish boundary: (5) (l) = 0 = (l) expectation values p real: h|p|i ir, |i dphys (6) thus, p symmetric operator. hand, since plane wave obeys boundary condition, eq.5, p possess (normalizable nonnormalizable) eigenvectors. thus p self-adjoint, instead p simple symmetric. 6 even though plane waves among physical states, plane waves course approximated sequences physical states approximately plane waves within interval , also quickly decay zero towards boundaries, always obey boundary condition, eq.5. one may therefore tempted assume p still approximately self-adjoint therefore describe sharp entity. is, however, case: indeed, already mentioned, p unsharp sense physical states |i dphys momentum uncertainty bounded xed nite amount: p() pmin = 2l normalized |i dphys (7) intuitively, reason larger part interval physical wave function approximates plane wave, steeper must decay zero towards boundaries. steep decay necessarily yields signicant contribution action derivative operator p. connected fact p noncontinuous operator. remark noncontinuous i.e. unbounded operators simple symmetric display unsharpness. explanation unsharpness phenomena terms, see . here, let us explicitly calculate physical states lowest momentum uncer- tainty. end, solve variational problem minimizing (p)2 = h|p2|i h|p|i2 (8) minimizing h|p2|i constraints h|p|i = h|i = 1, boundary condition eq.5. introducing lagrange multipliers k1, k2, functional minimized is: = z l l dx {(x)(x) + k1( c1) + k2(ix c2)} , yielding euler-lagrange equation: 2 x + k1 ix = 0 (9) (10) choice momentum expectation value hpi = , (up phase) one normalized boundary condition obeying solution: (x) = l1/2 cos(cid:18)x 2l(cid:19) eix (11) physical wave functions minimize p. see (x) essentially plane waves, apart modulus, approaches zero boundaries, must, physical state. clear modulus wave functions (x) goes zero optimal steepness minimize 7 momentum uncertainty p. minimum value uncertainty momentum particle box readily calculated solutions , as: pmin = qh|p2|i 2 = 2l (12) case here, minimum uncertainty pmin depend expectation value . note generic simple symmetric operators equal deciency indices minimum standard deviation depend expectation value: qmin = qmin(hqi). (13) standard procedure verify deciency indices p indeed equal, namely (1, 1). thus, short-distance structure (of momentum space) type fuzzy-a terminology {$9810215$}. 2.2 unsharp position operator let us illustrate phenomena example simple symmetric operator given explicitly terms innite dimensional matrix. consider operator q dened matrix q = 0 a1 0 0 ... a1 0 a2 0 ... 0 a2 0 a3 ... 0 0 a3 0 ... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . dene matrix elements := 1 + + s2 + ... sn1 (14) (15) constant, obeying 1. course, one may use partial geometric series: (16) 1 + + s2 + ... sn1 = (sn 1)/(s 1). dene domain dq q consist column vectors possess arbitrary nite number nonzero entries. domain dq dense hilbert space h = l2 square summable vectors, i.e. dq = h. clearly, qij = q ji. (17) thus, domain, dq, expectation values q real, i.e. q symmetric operator. 8 let us consider rst special case = 1. case = 1, matrix elements reduce = n. recognize q ordinary essentially self-adjoint quantum mechanical position operator, fock space representation. spectrum real line exist sequences vectors domain dq q becomes arbitrarily small, i.e. q sharp observable. situation qualitatively dierent > 1. shown {$9311147$} > 1, vectors dq uncertainty q nitely bounded below, by: qmin = 1 s1 (18) means normalized |i dq, i.e. normalized vectors arbitrary nite number nonzero entries, uncertainty q obeys: q(|i) = h|(q h|q|i)2|i1/2 qmin. (19) fact qmin = 1 s1 larger zero implies (normal- izable nonnormalizable) eigenvectors q, i.e. q self-adjoint. q shown simple symmetric type fuzzy-a, see . fact, example, minimum standard deviation nontrivial function expectation value q. simplicity, given absolute minimum qmin. precise form qmin(hqi) derivation, see {$9311147$}. finally, remark nite dimensional truncation matrix q could possess nonzero minimum uncertainty qmin > 0. notions symme- try self-adjointness dier innite dimensional hilbert spaces: every nite dimensional symmetric matrix also self-adjoint therefore possesses eigenvectors |qi which, course, q(|qi) = 0. 2.3 unsharpness noncommutativity statement self-adjoint operators always resolved arbitrary precision compatible heisenberg uncertainty principle. assume, example, two self-adjoint observables commute. then, holds uncertainty relation: 1 2 |hi| (20) implies course smaller value, say < t0 if, say,  = i1 rhs nonvanishing, yielding 1/2t0. thus, case, cannot made arbitrarily small possesses instead nite lower bound 9 smin = 1/2t0. contradiction statement self-adjoint operators always diagonalized, require t0 restrict hilbert space states t0 holds. restricted domain, operator self-adjoint, instead simple symmetric. general, noncommutativity symmetric operators physical theory induces interplay domains operators, turn aects whether self-adjoint merely symmetric. indeed, even generally, kinematical also dynamical operator equations, i.e. commutation relations also operator equations motion aect domains operators, therefore aect whether operators symmetric self-adjoint. thus, well-known much-discussed phenomenon sharpness unsharpness real entities quantum theory depend kinematics - uncertainty relations - appears priori reason exclude possibility sharpness real entities also change dynamically, example fundamental theory quantum gravity. 3 unsharp degrees freedom generating unitaries well-known, self-adjoint operators often act real degrees freedom, simultaneously also generators symmetries. merely symmetric operators, hand, directly generate unitary operators. appears indicate symmetric operators possess interesting prop- erty able describe unsharp real degrees freedom, able play role generation symmetries. here, therefore address problem generation unitary operators class simple symmetric operators describe fuzzy-a type short-distance structures, i.e. equal deciency indices. class includes exam- ples above, includes, particular, operators x nite lower bound xmin > 0. prove following: simple symmetric operator x equal deciency indices, acting physi- cal domain dphys dense hilbert space h, exists family self-adjoint operators x() coincide x physical domain. claim operators x(), together, generate full unitary group hilbert space. result shows that, way, operators class relate aspects symmetry hilbert space act. precise formulation general theorem proof given sec.4. before, 10 however, give detailed illustration theorem concrete examples. 3.1 theorem concrete examples order demonstrate mechanism simple symmetric operators able generate unitaries hilbert space, let us consider concrete example ordinary nonrelativistic quantum mechanics one dimension. case, particle real line, operators x p self-adjoint exponentiated yield unitaries: may represent operators x p, irreducibly, self-adjoint multiplication dierentiation operators x.(x) = x(x) p.(x) = ix(x) acting dense domain hilbert space h square integrable wave functions (x) real line. well-known, x p, together, generate unitary operators u hilbert space h, via weyl formula u = z z dsdt 2h u(s, t) exp (21) u(s, t) suitable complex-valued functions. fact, bounded operators b b(h) generated way. hand, also represent x p reducibly, example, self-adjoint multiplication dierentiation operators x.i(x) = xi(x) p.i(x) = ixi(x) (22) acting hilbert space wave functions i(x) real line possess additional isospinor index, running = 1, ..., n. scalar product wave functions contains iso-sum: h|i = n xi=1z dx (x)i(x) (23) clearly, x p acting diagonally isospinor space. therefore, x p generate u(n) isorotations. thus, case, weyl formula, eq.21, yield bounded operators yield unitaries hilbert space. supplemented operators x p additional hermitean n n matrices, ti, could generate u(n) isospinor space therefore b(h). let us consider case particle conned interval . saw above, momentum operator p = ix longer self-adjoint 11 instead simple symmetric type fuzzy-a. therefore, p matches condi- tions proposition. namely, proposition simple symmetric operator p type fuzzy-a, e.g. momentum particle box, exists one-parameter family self-adjoint operators p(), (0 < 2), that: p() coincides p physical domain, i.e. p()|i = p|i |i dphys p(), together, (weakly) generate algebra b(h) bounded operators hilbert space, includes course full unitary group h. indeed, claim that, unlike weyl formula, operator x longer needed generate b(h), operators p() alone already generate b(h) (even though p() coincides p dense physical domain dp). even further, consider case wave functions particle box carry isospinor index. then, p simple symmetric type fuzzy-a theorem applies. claim exists multi-parameter set self-adjoint operators p(u), coincide p physical states, generate b(h)! means need introduce isospin rotation generators tj hand, since p(u) able generate all: translations, phase rotations isorotations. 3.2 generating b(h) scalar case see this, consider rst case without isospinor index. discussed above, momentum operator p, acting p.(x) = ix(x) physical wave functions dphys interval simple symmetric operator. recall although physical wave functions vanish boundary, dense set hilbert space square integrables dphys = h = l2(l, l). let us construct family operators p() coincide p physical domain dphys, whose domain larger self-adjoint larger domain. end, dene operators p() extending domain dphys include wave functions periodic phase (l) = ei(l), 12 (24) arbitrary xed real number. precise, domain self-adjoint extension p() therefore dp() := dphys n(x) dp | (l) = ei(l)o , (25) dp domain adjoint operator p. note ei must xed phase order ensure boundary terms cancel partial integrations needed show h1|(p()|2i) = (h1|p())|2i. indeed, xed choice phase ei exist eigenvectors p(), i.e. plane waves, () n (x), obey corresponding boundary condition: () n (x) = einx n = 2n 2l , n zz (26) straightforward check, () p() self-adjoint. n form orthonormal eigenbasis p(), let us consider implications generating unitaries: wave functions restricted interval, p would self-adjoint p could exponentiated obtain unitary operator, say u(a) := exp(iap), (27) 0. action unitary translate wave functions amount right: (28) u(a).(x) = eax (x) = (x + a). case particle conned box, however, i.e. hilbert space consists wave functions interval, operator p self-adjoint cannot exponentiated: formal expression u(a) = exp(iap) unitary transformation, would translate beyond interval boundaries, dened hilbert space. nevertheless, particle box, exists, saw, whole family self- adjoint extensions p() p. since p() self-adjoint, exponentiated resulting operator u(a) := exp(iap()) (29) unitary. action u(a) wave functions translate wave functions right (for > 0), eq.28. now, however, due boundary condition, eq.24, part wave function would translated beyond right interval boundary reappears interval left, modulus, phase shifted phase ei. thus, unitary u(a) translates wave functions amount phase 13 shifts wave functions ei translating beyond boundary interval opposite boundary. let us consider composition unitaries. crucially, product u(a)u(a) (30) unitary operator translate wave functions. rst factor translates second factor translates back amount. nev- ertheless, since two factors translate dierent phase shifts, product identity operator. namely, u(a)u(a) unitary operator whose action leave modulus wave functions unchanged, phase shift wave functions part interval. e.g., choosing , action (x), u(a) u(a).(x) = ei()(x), x  x  (31) suitable composition operators u(a) various therefore possible generate unitaries yield arbitrary local phase rotations wave functions. example, choosing a, b obeying 0 < b < < 2l, form operator: u((a b)) u0(b) u(a).(x) (32) (x), ei()(x), x   x  = action operator phase rotate wave functions ei interval  leave wave functions invariant outside interval. thus, remarkably, set self-adjoints coincide p physical domain able generate translations also local phase rotations, recall case p self-adjoint, operator x needed order generate phase rotations, namely eif (x)(x) = eif (x)(x). 14 3.3 case isospin consider particle constrained interval . particles wave function i(x) shall carry isospinor index = 1, ..., n. scalar product hilbert space square integrables interval includes iso-sum: h|i = n xi=1z l l dx (x)i(x) (33) due box potential, physical wave functions, |i dphys, obey boundary condition (34) action p diagonal iso-space: p.i(x) = ixi(x). again, plane waves physical domain therefore momentum operator physical domain self-adjoint. instead, p simple symmetric (with deciency indices (n, n)). self-adjoint extensions p(u) obtained enlarging domain p include wave functions obey boundary condition i(l) = 0 = i(l), (i = 1, ...n) i(l) = n xi=1 uij j(l) (35) uij unitary n n matrix, generalizing phase ei scalar case above. readily checked, proof self-adjointness p(u) requires cancellation boundary terms arise partial integrations needed show (h|p(u))|i = h|(p(u)|i), cancellation achieved exactly boundary conditions form eq.35. scalar case, p directly yield unitaries, self-adjoint p(u) reduce p physical domain generate unitaries, e.g. expo- nentiation (a real) : uu(a) := eiap(u) (36) unitaries uu(a) act wave functions translating amount a, and, due self-adjoint extensions boundary conditions, part wave function hits boundary reappears side interval, iso-rotated matrix u (or u1 negative). possible proceed scalar case, composing unitaries translate wave functions back forth, using dierent self-adjoint extensions. clear way arbitrary local isorotations generated. thus, set self-adjoint operators reduce p physical domain indeed generates translations, may expected to, also arbitrary local phase rotations, - isospinor index present - even generate local iso-rotations. proceed proof theorem general case. 15 4 theorem 4.1 denitions let us recall symmetric operator x called simple symmetric x self- adjoint
