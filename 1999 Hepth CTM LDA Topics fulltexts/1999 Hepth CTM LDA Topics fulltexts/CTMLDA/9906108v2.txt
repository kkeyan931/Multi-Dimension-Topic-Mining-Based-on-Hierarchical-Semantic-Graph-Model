1.1 from point particle to extended ob-

jects

a p-brane is a p-dimensional spatially extended
object, generalizing the notion of point parti-
cles (p=0) to strings (p=1), membranes (p=2),
etc. we will discuss the dynamics of a free p-
brane, propagating in d spacetime dimensions
(p  d  1), using the rst quantized approach
in close analogy with the case of point parti-
cles.
indeed, the propagation of a point leads
to a world-line. the corresponding action that
describes the dynamics of a free particle is pro-

lectures given at flavour and gauge hierarchies,
cargese, france, 20 jul.-1 aug. 1998, and at corfu sum-
mer institute on elementary particle physics, kerkyra,
greece, 6-20 sep. 1998.

portional to the length of this line. the trajec-
tory which minimizes the action in at space is
then a straight line. similarly, the propagation
of a p-brane leads to a (p+1)-dimensional world-
volume. the action describing the dynamics of
a free p-brane is then proportional to the area of
the world-volume and its minimization implies
that the classically prefered motion is the one of
minimal volume.

more precisely, in order to describe the dy-
namics of a p-brane in the embedding d-dimen-
sional spacetime, we introduce spacetime coordi-
nates x () ( = 0, 1, .., d  1) depending on
the world-volume coordinates  ( = 0, 1, .., p).
the nambu-gotto action in a at spacetime is
then given by

s = t z 

deth dp+1 ,

(1.1)

where t is the brane tension of dimensionality

(mass)p+1, and

h = x x  x x 

(1.2)

is the induced metric on the brane.

an equivalent but more convenient descrip-

tion is given by the covariant polyakov action:

s = 

t

2 z dp+1 

deth{hx x

(p  1)} ,

(1.3)

where the intrinsic metric of the brane world-
volume h is introduced as an independent vari-
able. solving the equations of motion for x  and
h

(

deth hx) = 0 ,

h(x)2

(p  1)h = 0 ,

with (x)2  hx x, one nds

(1.4)

(1.5)

h = x x ;

p 6= 1 .

(1.6)

h is thus identied with the induced metric
(1.2), and after substitution into the polyakov ac-
tion (1.3) we obtain back the nambu-gotto form
(1.1).

the symmetries of the polyakov action are
(i) global spacetime lorentz invariance and (ii)
local world-volume reparametrization invariance
under an arbitrary change of coordinates  

() with x  and h transforming as a (p +
1)-dimensional scalar and symmetric tensor, re-
spectively. the local symmetry needs a gauge
xing: we should impose p + 1 gauge conditions,
so that only the d  (p + 1) transverse to the
brane oscillations are physical.

the equations of motion (1.4, 1.5) are gener-
ally complicated and simplify only for the cases
of particle (p = 0) and string (p = 1). indeed,
to solve the equations, we apply the gauge-xing
conditions on the elements of the p  p symmet-
ric matrix h, so that there remain 1
2 p(p + 1)
free components.

for p = 0, one can x the metric to a con-
stant, h = m2. furthermore, there is only
one world-line coordinate, the time  =  , and

ignatios antoniadis, guillaume ovarlez

the equation of motion (1.4) becomes x  = 0.
the general solution is

x ( ) = x 

0 + p ,

(1.7)

which is a straight line. on the other hand, the
second equation of motion (1.5) leads to the con-
straint

x 2 = m2 ,

(1.8)
which is the on-shell condition p2 = m2. the
quantization can be done following the canoni-
cal procedure, i.e. by applying the (equal-time)
commutators

[x ,

x ] = i ,

(1.9)

leading to the usual relation [x 

0 , p] = i .

for p = 1, we have two world-sheet coordi-
nates  = (, ), where  is a parameter along
the string. using the gauge freedom, one can x
two components of the metric and bring it into
the conformally at form

h(,  ) = e(, ) ,

(1.10)

where the scale factor  is the only remaining
degree of freedom. however for p = 1, the ac-
tion (1.3) has an additional symmetry under lo-
cal rescalings of the metric (local conformal in-
variance), so that  decouples from both the ac-
tion and the equations of motion (1.4, 1.5). as
a result, there is an additional gauge freedom
and one can again x the metric to a constant,
h = , as in the case p = 0. the equations
of motion for x  and constraints then read:

x  = 0 ,
1
2

x x =

(x)2 .

(1.11)

(1.12)

the above equations are further simplied by
dening light-cone variables ,    =   .
the equations of motion (1.11) then become

+x  = 0 ,

(1.13)

and the general solution for x () is separated
into left- and right-movers:

x () = x 

l(+) + x 

r() .

(1.14)

these functions are subject to the constraints
(1.12):

(+xl)2 = (xr)2 = 0 .

1.2 free closed and open string spectrum

n, a

n, a

by inspection of the commutation relations
(1.19, 1.20), one can identify a
n with n > 0
(a
n) with the annihilation (creation) oper-
ators. without loss of generality, let us rst re-
strict to the holomorphic (left-moving) part. as
usual, we can dene a vacuum |p > of momentum
p annihilated by a
n:

a
n|p >= 0

;

p |p >= p|p > .

(1.23)

the physical states are then created by the action
of a
ns on this vacuum after imposing the con-
straints (1.15). expanding the latter into fourier
decomposition, one should require:

2 xn6=0

where n is the number operator and the constant
c appears due to the normal ordering. these con-
straints are in fact necessary to eliminate the neg-
ative norm states generated by the action of the
time component of creation operators due to the
commutator (1.19); for instance ||a
m|p > || =
m < 0 for  = 0.

unitarity is manifest in the light-cone gauge
which xes the residual symmetry of the covari-
ant gauge xed equations (1.13) and (1.15) under
+  

+(+) and   

(). dening

x  = x 0  x d1 ,
this invariance can be used to set:

(1.26)

x + = x +

0 + p+ ,

(1.27)

while the constraints can be solved for x  in
terms of the transverse coordinates x t :

+x  =

2
p+ (+x t )2 .

(1.28)

thus, we are left only with the transverse at
that are the independent physical oscillations.

in order to write explicit solutions, we need to
impose boundary conditions that correspond in
general to two kind of strings: closed and open.
closed strings satisfy the periodicity condi-

tion

2 .1 the rst two terms
on the r.h.s. describe the motion of the closed
string center of mass, while the remaining terms
in the sum correspond to the string oscillations
of the left- and right-movers which are subject
to the constraints (1.15). reality of the coordi-
nates x  imply (a
n and similar for the
right-movers. applying the canonical quantiza-
tion procedure:

[x (, ),

x (, )] = 2i(  ) , (1.18)

one obtains the commutation relations

[x

for open strings, the only lorentz-invariant

boundary condition is the neumann one:

x |=0, = 0 ,

(1.21)

implying that the ends of the string propagate
with the speed of light. the general solution
(1.14) becomes in this case

the 0-mode of eq.(1.28) reproduces the global
hamiltonian constraint (1.25) that gives the mass
formula:

p2 = n  c .

(1.29)

the rst excited state at
1|p > with n = 1 is a
spacetime vector with d  2 transverse indepen-
dent components. therefore, by lorentz invari-
ance, it should be massless, implying c = 1. fur-
thermore, the quantum algebra of lorentz gen-
erators  or equivalently the absence of confor-
mal anomaly  xes the spacetime dimensional-
ity d = 26. as a result, one obtains:

n = 0
n = 1

n = 2 (cid:26) a

(1.30)
and so on. note that the states of highest spin j
at each mass level form a regge trajectory:

m 2 =

.

(1.31)

the spectrum of a closed string is obtained
by the direct product of states from left- and
right-movers with the condition m 2
r. at
the massless level, one thus has:

l = m 2

a
1a

1|p > ,

(1.32)

that can be decomposed into a spin 2 graviton
(symmetric traceless part), a scalar dilaton
(trace), and a 2-index antisymmetric tensor (2-
form). the automatic and unavoidable occur-
rence of the graviton in the massless spectrum is
of course welcome and constitutes a strong mo-
tivation for string theory as quantum theory of
gravity.

for open strings, there are no separate left-
and right-movers, but one has the freedom to in-
troduce additional quantum numbers associated
to their ends. as a result the vacuum of oscil-
lators becomes |p, ij >, where the indices i, j are
chan-paton charges living at the two ends of
the open string. their transformation proper-
ties dene a (non-abelian) gauge group, and the
massless states are now gauge elds:

ignatios antoniadis, guillaume ovarlez

they can form antisymmetric, symmetric, or com-
plex representations corresponding to orthogo-
nal, symplectic or unitary gauge groups, respec-
tively. obviously, open strings cannot be a the-
ory of gravitation as they do not contain a mass-
less graviton in the spectrum. however, in the
presence of interactions, closed strings appear by
unitarity making string theory as a candidate for
unication of gauge with gravitational forces.

string interactions of splitting and joining
can be introduced in analogy with the rst quan-
tized approach of point particles, where the world-
line can split using n-point vertices. however,
unlike the particle case, the string interaction
vertex is unique modulo world-sheet reparame-
trizations. as a result, interactions correspond to
world-sheets with non-trivial topology and string
perturbation theory becomes a topological ex-
pansion in the number of handles (for oriented
closed strings), as well as holes and crosscaps
(for open strings and orientation ips of closed
strings, respectively). as we will see in section
1.7, string diagrams are weighted by powers of a
coupling constant 2g2, with g = n + (h + c)/2
the genus of the surface given in terms of the
number of handles n, holes h and crosscaps c. an
important property of string interactions is that
(modulo reparametrizations) there is no local no-
tion of interaction point, which makes string per-
turbation theory free of ultraviolet divergences,
that occur in point particles by products of dis-
tributions at the same point. thus, string theory
provides a unique mathematical framework of de-
scribing non-trivial particle interactions with no
ultraviolet divergences.

1.3 compactication on a circle and t-duality

since the bosonic string lives in 26 dimensions,
one has to compactify 22 of those on some in-
ternal manifold of small (presently unobserved)
size. the simplest example of compactication is
given by one dimension x on a circle of radius r.
x must then satisfy the periodicity condition:3

x = x + 2r ,

(1.34)

so that the solution to the equations of motion

a
1|p, ij > .

(1.33)

3here we dene x  x 25.

4

ignatios antoniadis, guillaume ovarlez

the generic gauge group in the case of one dimen-
sion is the kaluza-klein u (1)l  u (1)r:
1|p >l a

1|p >r

a
1|p >l a25
with p25
l = p25

1|p >r , a25
r = 0 .

(1.40)

however, for the special value of the radius r = 1
there is an enhanced gauge symmetry su (2)l 
su (2)r, due to the appearance of extra massless
states:

m = n = 1  pl = 2, pr = 0 :
|  2 >l a
1|p >r
m = n = 1  pl = 0, pr = 2 :
a
1|p >l |  2 >r

(1.41)

this property will be generalized later on to non-
perturbative states.

for open strings, the neumann boundary con-
dition (1.21) imposes the windings to vanish, w =
0. thus, a t-duality is not anymore a symme-
try of the spectrum. under t-duality, p  w
(   ), and the neumann becomes a dirichlet
boundary condition:

 x|=0, = 0 ,

(1.42)

implying the ends of the string to be xed at par-
ticular points of the circle. in fact, a coordinate
(1.22) satisfying the neumann (n) condition can
be written in the form:

x = xl(+) + xr() ,

(1.43)

with left- and right-moving oscillators identied,
an = an. after the t-duality transformation
(1.38), it becomes

x = xl  xr
= x0 + 2w
+i2xn6=0

1
n

(1.44)

nein sin(n) ,
a

which is the general solution of the wave equa-
tion (1.13) satisfying the dirichlet (d) condition
(1.42), implying that the endpoints of the string
are xed at x|=0, = x0.
given the two ends of the open string, one
can choose independently the n or d condition
for each endpoint, implying three kinds of bound-
ary conditions: nn, dd and nd (for which p =

(1.13) is

note the appearance of a new term linear in
, which is allowed to be non-vanishing due to
the periodicity condition (1.34). its coecient is
quantized in units of r, w = nr, since for  
 + 2 we must have x  x + 2nr, where
n is the (integer) winding number of the string
around the circle. on the other hand, the in-
ternal momentum is also quantized in units of
1/r, p = m/r for m  z, which follows from
the requirement that plane waves eipx must be
univalued around the circle: x  x + 2r.

for closed strings, it is convenient to dene

left and right momenta:

pl,r =

m
r  nr ,

(1.36)

in terms of which the mass of physical states be-
comes (in 25 dimensions):

1

p2 =

1

p2
l + nl  1 =

1
4

p2
r + nr  1 . (1.37)

the above spectrum is invariant under the t-
duality symmetry r  1/r with the simultane-
ous interchange of momenta and windings:

1
r

r 

, m  n or xl  xl , xr  xr .
(1.38)
it can be shown that t-duality is also an exact
symmetry of the string interactions to all orders
of perturbation theory and it is conjectured to
hold at the non-perturbative level, as well. note
that the string coupling   26 should trans-
form, so that the lower dimensional coupling of
the compactied theory 25 = 26/r remains
inert:

 


r

.

(1.39)

an important consequence of the winding
modes in closed strings is the appearance of en-
hanced non-abelian gauge symmetries at special
values of the compactication radii. for instance,

5

ignatios antoniadis, guillaume ovarlez

that the superstring must live in d = 10 space-
time dimensions.

in order to obtain solutions to the equations
of motion, we need to discuss boundary condi-
tions. for both closed and open strings, there are
two possible conditions compatible with space-
time lorentz invariance:

(, ) = (,  + 2) ,

(1.47)

corresponding to the ramond (r) and neveu-
schwarz (ns) ones. the general solution can
then be expanded as (for instance for the left-
movers):

b
r eir( +)

;



l =xr

(b

r ) = b

r , (1.48)

where r is half-integer (integer) for ns (r) bound-
ary conditions, and upon quantization one has
the usual canonical anticommutator relations:

r , b
{b

s} =  r+s,0 .

(1.49)

the mass formula (1.29) now becomes:

1
4

p2 = n + n  c ,

where n = 1
2pr r : br  br : is a sum of half-
integer (integer) frequencies for ns (r) fermions,
and c = 1/2 (c = 0) in the ns (r) sector.

(1.50)

as in the bosonic string, unitarity is manifest
in the light-cone gauge, where only the transverse
oscillators create physical states. in the super-
string, there are however two sectors in the spec-
trum: the ns and the r sectors, corresponding to
antiperiodic and periodic world-sheet supercur-
rent (1.46) and giving rise to spacetime bosons
and fermions, respectively. in the ns sector, the
ground state is still a tachyon |p > of momentum
p and mass given by (1/4)p2 = 1/2, while at
the massless level there is a vector:

|; p >= b

1/2|p > .

(1.51)

in the r sector, the fermionic coordinates (1.48)
have zero-modes which satisfy the anticommuta-
tor relations (1.49), generating a ten-dimensional
cliord algebra:

{b
0 , b

0} =  .

(1.52)

w = 0). the introduction of dirichlet condi-
tions along the internal directions leads to the
notion of d-branes which are subsurfaces where
open strings can end. a dp-brane is then de-
ned by imposing neumann conditions along its
longitudinal directions x =0,..,p, and dirichlet
conditions along its transverse ones x i=p+1,..,25.
the endpoints are thus xed in the x i trans-
verse space, while they can move freely in a p+1
dimensional spacetime spanned by the world-vo-
lume of the p-brane.

it is now easy to see that performing a t-
duality along a compact transverse (longitudi-
nal) direction, a dp brane is transformed into
a d(p+1)-brane (d-(p-1)-brane). moreover, in
this picture, the chan-paton multiplicity corre-
sponds to the multiplicity of d-branes. thus, d-
branes on top of each other, labeled by a chan-
paton index, give a gauge group enhancement.

1.4 the superstring: type iia and iib

two immediate problems with the bosonic string
are the presence of tachyon (signaling a vacuum
instability) and the absence of fermions in the
spectrum. both problems can be solved in the
context of superstring, obtained by adding fer-
mions on the world-sheet.

the fermionic coordinates are weyl-majora-
na two-dimensional (2d) fermions 
l,r(,  ),
which carry a spacetime index . the 2d dirac
equation implies that the left (right) handed fer-
mions depend only on + (). as in the case
of bosonic coordinates, the timelike components
0
l,r generate extra negative norm states that
need a new local symmetry to be removed. this
is indeed the super-reparametrization invariance,
or equivalently local supersymmetry on the world-
sheet.
in the superconformal gauge (1.10), the
supersymmetry transformations read (for the left-
movers):

x 


l = ir
l = r+x 

l

l

and emerge from the 2d supercurrent

tf = 

l+x .

(1.45)

(1.46)

similar transformations hold for the right movers
by exchanging l  r and +  . the cancel-
lation of conformal anomalies imply in this case

6

ignatios antoniadis, guillaume ovarlez

where l, r denotes left, right 10d chiralities, and
| >r (| >l) stands for type iia (type iib). de-
composing the spectrum into representations of
the 10d little group so(8), one nds the bosons

| > | > = 1 + 35s + 28a
| > | > iia= 8(1form) + 56(3form)

iib= 1(0form) + 28(2form) + 35+

(4form)
(1.58)

and the fermions

| > | > = 8l + 56l
| > | > iia= 8r + 56r
iib= 8l + 56l

(1.59)

the ns-ns states 1, 35s and 28a in eq. (1.58)
denote the trace, the 2-index symmetric traceless
and antisymmetric combinations corresponding
to the dilaton, graviton and antisymmetric ten-
sor, respectively, that are part of the massless
spectrum of any consistent string theory. the
above massless spectra coincide with those of iia
and iib n = 2 supergravities in 10 dimensions;
note the two gravitini 56s in eq. (1.59) with op-
posite or same chirality.

upon compactication in nine dimensions on
a circle of radius r, the two type ii theories are
equivalent under t-duality:

r 

1
r

:

iia  iib .

(1.60)

this can be easily seen from the transformation
(1.38), whose action on the fermions is l  l
and r  r, in order to preserve the form of
the 2d supercurrent (1.46). as a result, ()fr =
11
r  11
r , implying a ip of the fermion chi-
rality in the right-movers.

1.5 heterotic string and orbifold compact-

ications

the heterotic string is a closed string obtained
by the tensor product of the superstring (for the
left-movers) and the bosonic string (for the right-
movers). since the left-moving coordinates live
in 10 dimensions while the right-moving ones in
26, 16 of the latter are compactied on an in-
ternal momentum lattice. one-loop modular in-
variance then implies that the corresponding mo-
menta pi
r (i = 1, . . . , 16) belong to an even self-
dual lattice (~pr~p
r  2z). there are

r  z and ~p 2



as a result, the oscillator vacuum forms a rep-
resentation of this algebra and corresponds to a
spacetime spinor |p,  > of dimension 2d/2 = 32,
on which b

0 act as the 10d gamma matrices:

i2 b

0|p,  >= 

|p,  > .

(1.53)

moreover, in the absence of oscillators, the con-
straint corresponding to the zero-mode of the 2d
supercurrent (1.46) generates the 10d massless
dirac equation which reduces the dimensionality
of the lowest lying state to 16, corresponding to
a massless 10d real (majorana) fermion.

at this point, the problem of the tachyon
remains. however, it turns out that the above
spectrum is not consistent with world-sheet mod-
ular invariance, which guarantees the absence of
global anomalies under 2d dieomorphisms dis-
connected from the identity that can be performed
in topologically non-trivial surfaces. consistency
of the theory already at the one-loop level (torus
topology) implies that one should impose the
(gso) projection:

()f = 1 ,

(1.54)

where f is the fermion number operator. this
projection eliminates the tachyon from the ns
sector, while in the r sector acts as spacetime
chirality. in fact, from the anticommutator

{()f , b

(1.55)
()f can be identied with the 10d 11 matrix,
in the absence of oscillators:

0} = 0 ,

()f = 11()p

n=1

it follows that at the massless level there is one
massless vector and one weyl majorana spinor,
having 8 bosonic and 8 fermionic degrees of free-
dom. this fermion-bose degeneracy holds to all
massive levels and is a consequence of a resulting
spacetime supersymmetry.

we can now discuss the spectrum of closed
superstrings. there are two dierent theories
depending on the relative (spacetime) chirality
between left- and right-movers: the type iia or
type iib corresponding to opposite or same chi-
rality, respectively. the massless spectrum is ob-
tained by the tensor product:

(| >,| >l)  (| >,| >r,l) ,

(1.57)

7

only two such lattices in 16 dimensions generated
by the roots of so(32) and e8  e8 groups.

the massless spectrum of the heterotic string

is given by the tensor product

(| >,| >)  | >= 1 + 35s + 28a + 8l + 56l ,
(1.61)
which forms the particle content of the n = 1
supergravity multiplet in 10 dimensions, and by

(| >,| >l)  |pi

r; ~p 2

r = 2 > ,

(1.62)

which forms a 10d n = 1 gauge supermultiplet
of so(32) or e8  e8.

upon compactication in nine dimensions on
a circle, the two heterotic theories are equivalent
under t-duality:

1
r

:

r 

het so(32)  het e8  e8 .
(1.63)
the continuous connection of the two theories
can be easily seen using the freedom of gauge
symmetry breaking by turning on wilson lines
(ux lines in the compact direction). these cor-
respond to the constant values of the internal
(10th) component of the gauge elds ai
9 along
the 16 cartan generators, and break generically
the gauge group to its maximal abelian subgroup
u (1)16. one can then show that eq. (1.63) is
valid at the point with so(16)  so(16) gauge
symmetry.

the heterotic string appears to be the only
perturbative closed string theory that can de-
scribe our observable world. one of the main
problems is however to get a 4-dimensional su-
perstring which is phenomenologically viable. in
particular, in order to be chiral the spectrum
should be at most n = 1 supersymmetric. for
a toroidal compactication, the 10d n = 1 spec-
trum is converted into a non-chiral n = 4 super-
symmetric spectrum in four dimensions.

a solution to this problem is provided by
orbifold compactications. these are obtained
from toroidal compactications by identifying
points under some discrete subgroup of the inter-
nal rotations that remains an exact symmetry of
the compactied theory. the resulting compact
spaces are not smooth manifolds because there
are singularities associated to the xed points.
string propagation however is made consistent

ignatios antoniadis, guillaume ovarlez

because modular invariance requires the presence
of a new (twisted) sector corresponding to strings
with center of mass localized at the orbifold xed
points. in four dimensions, the internal rotations
form an so(6)  su (4) and the condition of un-
broken n = 1 supersymmetry amounts to divide
the torus t 6 with a discrete subgroup of su (3)
that leaves one of the four gravitini invariant.

the simplest orbifold example reduces the
number of supersymmetries by 1/2 and can be
studied in 6 dimensions. it is dened by t 4/z2,
where the z2 inverts the sign of the four internal
coordinates x i  x i (i = 1, . . . , 4) and of their
fermionic superpartners. since in the heterotic
string there are no right-moving superpartners,
z2 should also act non-trivially on the gauge de-
grees of freedom breaking partly the gauge sym-
metry together with the n = 4 supersymmetry.
to see the reduction of supersymmetry in the
massless sector, consider the (left-moving) ra-
mond vacuum that forms a 10d weyl majorana
spinor with ()f = 1. its decomposition under
so(4)  so(4), with the rst factor correspond-
ing to the 6d little group and the second to the
internal rotations, reads

 i
+ 
 +

(1.64)

where the signs denote the chiralities under the
two so(4). the z2 orbifold action on this spinor
is identical to the chirality projection in the inter-
nal part and thus eliminates half of the gravitini.
the hilbert space of the theory consists in

two sectors:

 the untwisted sector which is obtained from
the hilbert space of the toroidal compacti-
cation on t 4 projected into the z2 invari-
ant states:
|pi = 0 >+ ,
|pi = 0 > ,

|pi > +|  pi >
|pi > |  pi >

with even number of oscillators

with odd number of oscillators

(1.65)
where |pi = 0 > denote the z2 even (+)
and odd () states with vanishing inter-
nal momentum pi in which the z2 action is
non-trivial.

thus, are conned to live on 5d subspaces
(in the large volume limit).

multiplicity of d9-branes, leading to an so(32)

under a t-duality along one compact direc-

tion, we get

1.6 type i string theory

up to this point, we have seen four consistent
closed superstring theories in ten dimensions:
type iia and iib with two spacetime supersym-
metries, and heterotic so(32) and e8  e8 with
one supersymmetry. moreover, the two type ii
theories and the two heterotic ones are connected
by t-duality upon compactication to nine di-
mensions. actually, there is a 5th consistent
superstring theory in 10d with n = 1 super-
symmetry, the type i theory of open and closed
strings; open strings provide the gauge sector,
while closed strings provide gravity needed for
unitarity.

a consistent algorithm to construct type i
theory is to orbifolding type iib by the world-
sheet involution  that exchanges left- and right-
movers and is a symmetry of the theory:

 :

  

(l  r) .

(1.66)

we thus obtain type i theory = iib/. as in
ordinary orbifolds, the spectrum consists in an
untwisted and a twisted sector.

the untwisted sector contains closed strings
projected by  (unoriented closed strings). this
turns to symmetrize the ns-ns sector and to
antisymmetrize the r-r. as a result, the two-
index ns-ns antisymmetric tensor is projected
out, together with the r-r scalar and 4-form (see
eq.(1.59)), and we are left with the scalar dila-
ton scalar  and the symmetric tensor (graviton)
g from ns-ns, and a 2-form b from r-r.

the twisted sector corresponds to the xed
points x(,  ) = x(,  ) which are equiva-
lent to the (neumann) boundary conditions for
open strings: x|=0, = 0. moreover, the
xed-point multiplicity n corresponds to the
chan-paton charges. it is determined by the tad-
pole cancellation condition, that plays the role
of modular invariance for open and closed unori-
ented strings and guarantees the absence of po-
tential gauge and gravitational anomalies. one
nds n=32 which can also be interpreted as the

x = xl + xr  x = xl  xr
and the action of (l  r) becomes

x   x .

so the eect of a t-duality on  is

  r ,

(1.67)

(1.68)

(1.69)

where r is dened as r : x  x. therefore,
t-duality gives

type i = iib/  type i = iia/r (1.70)

1.7 eective eld theories
at low energies, lower than the string scale 1/2,
one can integrate out all massive string modes to
obtain an eective eld theory for the massless
excitations of the string. there are two ways to
obtain this eective action. either by computing
the string scattering amplitudes, or by consid-
ering string propagation in the presence of non-
trivial background elds. the latter is described
by the world-sheet action:

1

s = 

(1.72)

4 r d2{g(x)x x 

+b(x)x x 
(x)r(2) + aa
(x)j 

a + ...} ,

where g , b, , aa
, . . . are backgrounds for
the massless elds (metric, 2-index antisymmet-
ric tensor, dilaton, gauge elds, etc), and r(2)
denotes the 2d scalar curvature. note that this
is the most general non-linear sigma model which
is renormalizable in two dimensions. conformal
invariance implies the vanishing of all beta-func-
tions which reproduce the spacetime equations of
motion for the background elds.

a particular property of string theories, that
can be seen from the action (1.72), is that the
constant dilaton background e plays the role of
the string coupling. indeed, a shift    + c
amounts to multiply the path integral by a factor

es  e2c(g1)es ,

(1.73)

9

where g is the genus of the world-sheet, and we
used the euler integral

1

4 z d2r(2) = 2(g  1) .

(1.74)

it follows that the dilaton shift can be absorbed
in a rescaling of the string coupling   ec. the
10d eective action can therefore by expanded in
powers of e corresponding to the perturbative
topological string expansion:

ignatios antoniadis, guillaume ovarlez

eld theory solitons. in this section we will estab-
lish that string solitons are p-brane extended ob-
jects and study their main properties. as point-
particles (0-branes) are electric sources for gauge

(1-branes) are sources for two-index antisymmet-

elds (1-forms), with a couplingr adx, strings
ric tensors (2-forms), with a couplingr bdx

dx as displayed in eq. (1.72)), p-branes can be
seen as electric sources for (p + 1)-form poten-
tials, with a coupling:

sef f =z d10x { e2[r(10) + ]

(1.75)

+e[] + 1[] + } .

the rst term proportional to e2 corresponds
to the tree-level contribution associated to spher-
ical world-sheet topology (g = 0), the second
term multiplying e denotes the disk contribu-
tion (g = 1/2), the third term proportional to
the identity corresponds to the one-loop toroidal
topology (g = 1), and so on. closed oriented
string diagrams give rise to even powers e2(g1)
with g integer, while closed unoriented and open
string diagrams introduce boundaries and cross-
caps having g half-integer and can lead to odd
powers of e, as well.

2. introduction to non-perturbative

string theory

2.1 string solitons

the rst step towards a non-perturbative under-
standing of string theory is to study the analog of

z a(p+1)

1...p+1dx1  ...  dxp+1 ,

(2.1)

with i = 0, 1, , p.

magnetic sources can be understood in a sim-
ilar way by performing poincare duality to the
corresponding eld strengths.
in fact, a (p +
1)-form potential has a (p + 2) eld strength
h (p+2) = da(p+1). hodge duality in d dimen-
sions then gives a d  (p + 2) dual form:

h (dp2) = h (p+2) ,

(2.2)

with  the corresponding levi-civita totally an-
tisymmetric tensor. this dual eld strength is
now associated a (d  3  p)-form dual poten-
tial h (dp2) = d a(dp3), which couples to
(d 4 p)-branes playing the role of magnetic
sources for the initial (p + 1)-form potential. as
a result, a (p + 1)-form potential has p-branes
as electric sources and (d  4  p)-branes as
magnetic ones. furthermore, the analog of dirac
quantization gives the following relation between
the dual charges p of branes:

p d4p = 2n , n  z .

(2.3)

for instance, in d = 4 dimensions, point
particles (p = 0) electrically charged are dual to
(point-like) magnetic monopoles, while it is also
possible to have dyons carrying simultaneously
non-vanishing electric and magnetic charges. sim-
ilarly, one can have dyonic strings (p = 1) in
d = 6, dyonic membranes (p = 2) in d = 8, and
dyonic 3-branes in d = 10.

let us now consider the spectra of the vari-

ous string theories:

 in the heterotic string, there is a 2-form po-
tential b . its electric source is the fun-
damental string, while its magnetic source
is a solitonic ns 5-brane.

10

 in type ii strings the same result holds for
the ns-ns antisymmetric tensor.
in ad-
dition, as we have seen in section 1.4 (eq.
(1.58), there are r-r p-form potentials aris-
ing in the decomposition of two spinors. in
contrast to the ns-ns 2-form, the r-r po-
tentials have no elementary (perturbative)
sources of either electric or magnetic type.
this can be understood for instance from
the vanishing of all amplitudes containing
r-r elds at zero momentum since the cor-
responding string vertices involve directly
their eld strengths.

in type iia, there are all possible even-form
r-r eld strengths: 0, 2, 4 and their duals
6, 8, 10. they give rise to odd-form po-
tentials 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, having even p-brane
sources p = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.

in type iib, there are all possible odd-form
r-r eld strengths: 1, 3, 5 and their duals
5, 7, 9, the 5-form being self-dual. they
give rise to even-form potentials 0, 2, 4, 6,
8, having odd p-brane sources p = 1, 1, 3,
5, 7. note the (1)-branes that correspond
to instantons.

the r-r p-branes are called dp-branes be-
cause they interact through the emission of
open strings with dirichlet boundary con-
ditions in the transverse to the world-volu-
me directions.

 in type i theory, there is no 2-form from
the ns-ns sector, because of the left-right
symmetrization of the spectrum. similarly,
because of the antisymmetrization of the
r-r sector, only the 2-form (and its 6-form
dual) potential survive in the spectrum cou-
pled only to d1 and d5-branes.4 using now
t-duality to type i, one can actually gen-
erate all types of dp-branes.

all the branes we found above are solutions
of the supergravity eective action. they are 1/2
bps states breaking 1/2 of the supersymmetries,
and they form short supermultiplets (analog of
massless representations). their mass is deter-
mined by their charge due to the supersymmetry

4in fact, there are also 32 d9 branes, which is a special
case as there is no eld strength for a 10-form potential.

algebra, and using the bps property the mass
formula receives no quantum corrections.

the eective action of a p-brane (neglecting

background elds) is:


s = tpz(p+1)
 det h
pz a(p+1)

1...p+1dx1  ...  dxp+1 ,

(2.4)

with h = x x. the bps property xes
its tension tp to be equal to its charge p in 10d
supergravity units:

p =q22

10tp

22

10 = (2)7()42 .

(2.5)
for dp-branes, the values of the tension (or the
charge) can be extracted from the one-loop vac-
uum amplitude of an open string ending on two
d-branes, which can also be seen in the trans-
verse channel as the propagation of a closed string
between the two d-branes. the result is:

1

tp =
 (2)p()
p = 2(42)

1+p

,

(2.6)

which satises the dirac quantization condition
(2.3) with minimal charge n = 1. notice the non-
perturbative factor 1/ in the expression of the
d-brane tension (2.6).

besides the check of the quantization con-
dition (2.3), one can derive a recursion relation
for the d-brane tensions by use of t-duality dis-
cussed in section 1.6. in fact, a t-duality trans-
formation along a compact direction longitudinal
to the brane, maps a dp-brane to a d(p  1).
wrapping the dp-brane around a circle of ra-
dius r, one gets a (p  1)-brane with tension
2rtp. performing now a t-duality along the
circle (r  /r,   /r) and using
the non-perturbative dependence tp  1/, one
nds the relation

2rtp  2 tp  tp1 ,

(2.7)

which is satised by the general formula (2.6).

the tension and charge of the fundamental

string are:

tf und =

f und = (2)

(2.8)

11

to nd the tension and charge of the ns 5-brane,
the magnetic dual of the fundamental string, we
can use the quantization condition (2.3) with min-
imal charge n = 1 and the bps relation (2.5) to
deduce:

tns 5 =

1

2(2)5()3

ns 5 =

1
(2) 3
2  

.

(2.9)
notice that the tension of the ns 5-brane is pro-
portional to 1/2, in contrast to the 1/ factor of
d-branes, while the tension of the fundamental
string is of course perturbative (of order unity).
upon compactication to lower dimensions,

on nds two important consequences:

 a p-brane wrapped around a p-cycle of the
compact manifold lead to a non-perturba-
tive point-like state with

mass = tension  area of the cycle,

(2.10)
generalizing the notion of string winding
modes with mass an integer multiple of
2r/(2). for non-trivial manifolds, if
the cycle shrinks to zero size, one obtains
new non-perturbative massless states that
can be charged under some gauge elds and
give rise to enhanced gauge symmetries. in
this way, it is possible to obtain non-pertur-
batively interesting non-abelian gauge
groups in type ii theories.

 a p-brane with euclidean world-volume
wrapped around a (p + 1)-cycle leads to
an instanton and thus can generate non-
perturbative corrections to the eective ac-
tion, proportional to

es ,

s = tension  world volume .
(2.11)
the ns 5-brane generate typical eld the-
ory instanton corrections of order e1/2
,
following from the expression of its tension
(2.9). on the other hand, d-branes have
tension  1/ generating non-perturbative
eects of order e1/. these are typical
stringy in nature and are much stronger
than the eld theory ones in the weak cou-
pling limit.

2.2 non-perturbative string dualities

in part 1, we have found ve consistent super-
string theories in ten dimensions. two type ii
with n = 2 supersymmetry, and two heterotic
and the type i with n = 1 supersymmetry. the
two type ii theories, as well as the two heterotic
ones are related by t-duality upon compactica-
tion in nine dimensions, leaving in principle three
independent consistent superstring theories. in
perturbation theory, type ii theories are phe-
nomenologically uninteresting since they contain
only gravity in ten dimensions and compactica-
tion is not sucient to produce the rich particle
content of the standard model, while type i the-
ory appears quite complicated. this singled out
the heterotic string as the theory where most of
the eort was devoted. the surprising result of
string dualities is that when non-perturbative ef-
fects are taken into account, all superstring the-
ories are equivalent in the sense that they corre-
spond to dierent perturbative vacua of the same
underlying theory, called m-theory, which con-
tains also a new vacuum described by the 11d
supergravity.

the s-duality inverts the coupling constant
  1/ and exchanges the role of perturbative
states with solitons. t-duality (1.38) is thus an
s-duality from the 2d world-sheet point of view,
since the radius r is the coupling constant of
the 2d -model and winding modes correspond
to solitons. in ten dimensions, there are two s-
duality conjectures:

1. type i - het so(32)

,

bh
  bi

 ,

(2.12)

under which we identify

d1  string  het string
d5  brane  het ns 5  brane .

(2.13)

by identifying the tension of the d1-brane
with the one of the heterotic string t1 =
1/(i 2
h), we derive the
relation between the type i and heterotic
scales:

i )  1/(2


h = i 

i .

(2.14)

12

2. type iib is self-dual under the s-duality
group sl(2, z)s, acting on  complexied
with the r-r scalar (see spectrum (1.58)):

 (cid:19) =(cid:18) p q

r s(cid:19)(cid:18) bn s
 (cid:19)


brr

(2.15)

(2.16)

with the integer parameters satisfying ps
qr = 1. for the particular case p = s = 0
and q = r = 1, one nds the simple s-
duality   1/ and bn s  brr, which
correspond to the exchange:

iib string  d1  string (2.17)

ns 5  brane  d5  brane

by comparing the fundamental and d1-
string tensions, we get again the transfor-
mation   .
to summarize up to this point, we have dis-

cussed the following relations:

t

nsusy = 1 : hete8e8
nsusy = 2 : iia t iib s iib

 hetso(32)

s

 type i
(2.18)

which lead to two independent theories accord-
ing to the number of supersymmetries. the next
question is how to relate theories with dierent
number of space-time supersymmetries. the an-
swer is after compactication on dierent appro-
priate manifolds leading in lower dimensions to
the same number of supersymmetries.

the rst non-trivial example arises in six
dimensions. we can relate the heterotic string
compactied on t 4 and type iia on k3, which
have both n = 2 (non-chiral) supersymmetry in
d = 6, by identifying the following branes:

het ns 5-brane wrapped around t 4

iia ns 5-brane wrapped around k3

 iia string

(2.19)
comparing the branes tensions tf und  tns 5v4
with v4 the volume of the 4d compact manifold,

 het string

ignatios antoniadis, guillaume ovarlez

we deduce that the two theories are related by
an s-duality in d = 6:

6 

1
6

and

  2

6  ,

(2.20)

where 6 = /v4 is the string coupling in six
dimensions.

the two theories have indeed the same 6d
massless spectrum, which consists of the n = 2
supergravity multiplet coupled to u (1)20 abelian
vector multiplets containing 4  20 = 80 scalar
moduli. however there is a potential problem:
on the heterotic side, there are special points in
the moduli space with enhanced gauge symme-
tries, while on the type iia side there are no
perturbative states charged under the u (1)s be-
cause the latter come from the r-r sector. the
missing states appear in fact non-perturbatively
and correspond to d2-branes wrapped around 2-
cycles of k3. as we discussed in the previous
section, these states become massless when the
cycles shrink to zero-size, giving rise to enhanced
gauge symmetries.

2.3 m-theory

the connection between the heterotic and type
ii theories can also be understood from eleven
dimensions, suggesting the existence of some un-
derlying fundamental theory, called m-theory,
whose low-energy limit is d = 11 supergravity.
in this context, the various string dualities follow
from 11d general coordinate invariance.

d = 11 supergravity is unique and contains
the metric g, the gravitino and a 3-form poten-
tial a(3). upon dimensional reduction on a cir-
cle, it gives the d = 10 iia supergravity with
the following eld identication:

11d g a(3)
iia g b

11 g1111 g 11 a(3)

a a(3)




(2.21)

where b is the ns-ns 2-index antisymmetric ten-
sor,  the dilaton and a(p) the r-r p-form poten-
tials. from the identication of the dilaton with
g1111, it follows that the type iia string coupling
is given by the radius of the eleventh dimension:

r11 =  .

(2.22)

the corresponding kaluza-klein (kk) states with
masses n/r11  1/ are non-perturbative states

13

from the type iia viewpoint and can be identied
with d0-branes. indeed d0-branes are charged
under the r-r gauge eld a which is precisely
the kk u (1) g 11. moreover, the d0-brane ten-
sion t0 = 1/ = 1/r11 is the same with
the mass of the lightest kk mode having the
minimum charge. kk states become innitely
heavy and decouple in the type iia weak cou-
pling limit. on the other hand, when   ,
they become light and the eleventh dimension
opens up (r11). as a result, the strong cou-
pling limit of type iia string theory is described
by the d = 11 supegravity.

in order to describe the rest of the type iia
spectrum, 11d supergravity should be implemen-
ted with (bps) sources for the 3-form potential,
in the context of the underlying m-theory. a
membrane (m2-brane) as electric source and a
m5-brane as a magnetic one. upon compacti-
cation on a circle s1 of radius r11, one obtains
the following identication:

fundamental string  m2-brane wrapped on s1

ns 5-brane  m5-brane

(2.23)

d0-brane  kk
d2-brane  m2-brane
d4-brane  m5-brane wrapped on s1
d6-brane  kk monopole

the tensions of m-theory branes can be com-
puted in the eective supergravity, although they
are essentially determined by dimensional anal-
ysis in terms of the 11d gravitational constant
11:

.

in 11d supergravity units, p = p22

they satisfy the quantization condition (2.3) for
n = 1, with the charges equal to the tensions
11tp as in
eq.
(2.5). all type iia brane tensions can be
derived from eqs. (2.24), (2.25), using the iden-
tication (2.23), in terms of 2 parameters: 11
and r11, or equivalently  and  (determined by
the dimensional reduction). in fact, the quanti-
zation condition (2.3) leaves us with three inde-

pendent tensions that are given in terms of two
parameters, so that there is one non-trivial rela-
tion among the tensions. since this relation can
be understood from t-duality (2.7) within type
iia theory, it follows that t-duality is a conse-
quence of 11d reparametrization in the context
of m-theory.

we have seen above that m-theory compact-
ied on a circle s1 describes the strong coupling
limit of type iia. one can also argue that m-
theory compactied on a line segment s1/z2 de-
scribes the strong coupling limit of the heterotic
string e8  e8. besides inverting the 11th co-
ordinate x11  x11, z2 changes also the sign
of the 3-form a(3)  a(3). as a result, g 11
and a(3)
 are projected out and the z2 invariant
(untwisted) bosonic spectrum is

g , a(3)

11  b , g1111   ,

(2.26)

which forms the particle content of n = 1 super-
gravity in d = 10. this truncation of the spec-
trum introduces a potential gravitational anomaly
at the two (ten-dimensional) ends of the segment,
which is cancelled by introducing twisted states
localized at the two endpoints. they consist of
two 9-brane walls with one e8 gauge factor each.
the distance between the two walls is the radius
of the 11th dimension which is related to the het-
erotic string coupling by the same relation (2.22)
as in type iia.

with this result, we completed the discus-
sion on the connection of all known consistent
superstring theories in the context of m-theory.

2.4 eective eld theories and duality tests

here, we will rederive the duality transforma-
tions that relate the dierent string theories in
various dimensions by studying the eective eld
theories, and discuss some duality tests.

the 10d eective lagrangians for heterotic

and type i theories are:

where d is the d-dimensional dilaton, such that
ed = d is the d-dimensional string coupling,
and for simplicity you keep only the gravitational

 finally, in d = 4 one obtains a mixing:

(2.36)

for type iia compactied on k3, the eec-

tive eld theory lagrangian is:

f 2 ,

(2.37)

where the absence of dilaton dependence in gauge
couplings is due to the fact that gauge elds are
r-r states. compactifying to d dimensions and
going to the einstein frame as before, we obtain
the gauge coupling:

d2 ii

d v ii

6d .

(2.38)

we can now deduce the dualities between het-
erotic string on t 4 and type iia on k3:

 in d = 6 we have
eii
6  eh

(2.39)

which is an s-duality 6  1/6. more-
over, by identifying the newtons constant
on both sides:

(2.40)

we get   2
formations (2.20).

 in d = 4 we have
2 = e2h
v ii
4 ,

(2.41)

which is a u-duality 4  1/r, with r
dened by v2  r2.
let us now start from 11 dimensions with the

supergravity lagrangian

(2.42)

compactifying to 10 dimensions, with the identi-
cation (2.21) a(3)

rescaling the metric g  g /r11, we obtain

11  b and g11 11  r2

l

(2.43)

and gauge kinetic terms. the dierence between
the two lagrangians comes from the dierence in
the topological expansion of the two theories, as
discussed in section 1.7: gauge elds appear on
the sphere in closed strings, at the same order
with gravity, while they appear on the disk in
open strings.

compactifying to d dimensions, the lagran-
gian is multiplied by the internal volume v10d
(in string units)

l  l v10d ,

(2.29)

and we dene the d-dimensional dilaton

e2d  e210 v10d .

(2.30)

in order to normalize the gravitational kinetic
terms, we go to einstein frame by rescaling the
metric

g  g e

(2.31)

the gauge kinetic terms take then the form

we can now deduce the duality transforma-

gauge couplings in both theories:

(2.33)

which is an s-duality   1/. on the
other hand, by identifying the newtons
constant on both sides:

(2.34)

we get   , thus reproducing the
transformations (2.12) and (2.14).

 in d = 6 we have

(2.35)

which is a u-duality   1/r2, with r

expression should produce the perturbative and
non-perturbative corrections on the other side,
providing an explicit duality test.

a similar but much more non-trivial exam-
ple arises in d = 4, for string vacua with n = 2
supersymmetry, obtained by compactifying het-
erotic or type i on k3t 2 and type ii on calabi-
yau. in this case, one has vector multiplets con-
taining a vector, two scalars and a dirac fermion,
and hypermultiplets. moreover, for neutral hy-
permultiplets, supersymmetry implies a no-mix-
ing at the level of low-energy lagrangian. now,
the heterotic 4d dilaton belongs to a vector while
the size of t 2 belongs to a hyper. the oppo-
site is true on the type ii side, while heterotic 
type ii duality (2.41) maps the dilaton of the one
theory to the t 2 size of the other. as a result,
ln =2
4, vectors can be computed exactly by a tree-level
computation on type ii side and should produce
the perturbative (which stops at one-loop) and
non-perturbative expansion of the heterotic the-
ory. finally, on the type i side, one has to dene
linear combinations and duality with heterotic
(2.36) is more involved. both vectors and hypers
can receive type i string corrections.

which reproduce the relation (2.22).

one consequence of the relations obtained in
this section is that although s-dualities are non-
perturbative in higher dimensions, they may be-
come perturbative after compactication which
makes possible to perform various duality tests
by comparing appropriate couplings in the ef-
fective action. in addition, non-renormalization
theorems due to extended supersymmetry make
in some cases possible to obtain exact results.

the rst non-trivial example arises in d =
6, for string vacua with n = 1 supersymme-
try, obtained by compactication of heterotic or
type i theories on k3.
in this case, there are
two types of (massless) supermultiplets containg
scalars: the tensor multiplet with one scalar, a
self-dual 2-form and a weyl fermion, and the
hypermultiplet, containing 4 scalars and a weyl
spinor. moreover, for neutral hypermultiplets,
supersymmetry implies that the low-energy (two-
derivative) eective lagrangian is a direct sum of
two pieces, one describing the interactions of ten-
sors and the other describing the interactions of
hypers:

ln =1

6

= ln =1

6, tensors + ln =1

6, hypers .

(2.45)

it turns out that on the heterotic side, the 6d
dilaton h
6 belongs to a tensor multiplet while
the compactication volume v h
4 belongs to a hy-
permultiplet. the opposite is true on the type i
side, while duality (2.35) maps the dilaton of the
one theory to the compactication volume of the
other. since tensors cannot mix with neutral hy-
pers, it follows that ln =1
6, tensors can be computed
exactly by a tree-level computation on type i,
while ln =1
6, hypers can be computed exactly by a
tree-level computation on heterotic. higher or-
der
(perturbative or non-perturbative) cor-
rections are forbidden because they depend on
the string coupling and would bring a dilaton
dependence and therefore a mixing. the exact
