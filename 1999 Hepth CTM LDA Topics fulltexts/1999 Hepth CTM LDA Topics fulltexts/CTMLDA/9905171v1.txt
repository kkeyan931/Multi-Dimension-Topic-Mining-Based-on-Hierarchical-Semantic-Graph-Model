we study the behavior of bound energy levels for the case of two classical interacting elds
4 4 self
 and  in a nite domain (box) in (1 + 1) dimension. the total lagrangian contain a 
interaction and an interaction term given by g22. we calculate the energy eigenfunctions and
its correspondent eigenvalue and study their dependence on the size of the box (l) as well on
the free parameters of the lagrangian: mass ratio  = m 2
, and interaction coupling constants

m 2

 and g. we show that for some congurations of the above parameters, there exists a critical
size of the box for which a kind -condensate appears.

i. introduction

it is well known quantum physical systems can alter signicantly their behavior when placed

inside cavities. a modern paradigm is the famous casimir eect [1] and more recently the so

called cavity quantum electrodynamics [2,3].

from a mathematical point of view part of these studies can be translated into the general

setting of dierential equations for quantum elds on which are imposed suitable boundary

conditions, in order to know wavefunctions and energy eigenvalues. the above mentioned

subjects are essentially of quantum nature. nevertheless it is well known that, for several

applications, quantum elds can be thought as classical elds on which are added quantum

corrections [4]. in this sense, although at a classical level, we can get a lot of information about

the system under study.

in this work we study the inuence of boundary conditions on bound energy levels of a

classical system of elds described by lagrangian density

(1)

where , g are coupling constants. we consider only the simpler case of elds  and  inside a

nite box (interval) in (1 + 1) dimension. of course all discussion can be generalized to higher

dimensions with a number of new dierentials equations and boundary conditions related to

geometry of the box. the quantum version of the theory, in a semiclassical approach will be

done elsewhere.

the equation of motion (e.o.m.) for the two elds are given by

  + m 2

  2 g2 = 0,

  + m 2

  3 = 0.

(2)

(3)

in eq.(2) we have neglected the term 2 g2 which can be interpreted as the back-reaction
of eld  on the mass term of . this can be achieved if we impose for example that
|| << min{ m
2 g}. of course other regimes can be studied from eq. (3) adopting dierent
approximations.

in a previous work [5] we have studied in (1 + 1) dimension the eld (x), unlike (x), is

not inuenced by nite boundary conditions of the box. so (x) is the kink solution of eq.
(3) in (, +) [6]. in this case we can think -eld is placed in a xed potential 2 and we
showed that -particle creation can be induced by squeezing the box below a critical size.

in this work we take into account the same boundary conditions for both elds  and .
this means that the potential 2 depends on the size of the box. so we study the behavior

2

of the energy levels of  eld by running the parameters l, , , g, where  = m 2

m 2

ratio and l is the box size. of course, the box size is an external parameter of the theory. we

is the mass

show a kind of particle-antiparticle condensate appears for a critical size of box.

the general static solutions of the classsical equation of motion to the eld (x) are given

by sn-type elliptic functions [7]

c(x) = 

sn  mx

2 q1 + 1  2c, l! ,

m2c

q1 + 1  2c

where c is a parameter belonging to interval (0, 1

2 ] and

l =

1

1 + 1+12c

c

.

clearly, l  (0, 1].
so, the equation of motion for the eld  can be written as

(5)

  + m 2
 

4 g m 2
c

(1 + 1  2c)

sn2  mx

2 q1 + 1  2c, l!!  = 0.

since we are interested in stationary solutions we can write (x, t) = ei t(x), where 

are energy eigenvalues. with this, the previous equation we can be writen in the form

(6)

in the next section we calculate the energy eigenvalue of eq. (6) as well study their depen-
dence on the parameters of the theory, namely, g, ,  = m 2
, l. for short   (, g, ; l),

m 2

where the semicolon means l is an external parameter of the theory. in section iii we study

the level shifts induced by changing the box size and interpret the results. in section iv we

conclude with some comments and list some topics for future work.

ii. boundary conditions and energy eigenvalues

in this section we study the bound levels of two interacting elds which are conned inside

a box (interval in our case) of length l. as a natural mathematical way to model connement,

we impose dirichlet boundary conditions for both elds  and  (or ).

in [7] the authors showed that imposing dirichlet boundary conditions on the eld , given

by (4), conned to a box of size l, it must satisfy the condition

ml = 41 + l k(l),

3

(7)

where 4k(l) is a period of the jacobi elliptic functions sn(u, l) [8].

since we take the same boundary conditions for both elds (same kind of connement), this

implies that the same l = l(l) obtained from the above equation must be substituted in the

-eld boundary conditions, in order to nd its energy eigenvalues.

of course dierent boundary conditions can be imposed independently on the elds  and .

for example, in our previous work [5] we have studied the extreme case that the box boundaries

are transparent for the eld , while  satises dirichlet boundary conditions.

we start making the changes of variables,

 =

and

2 =

(e  2)

m 2
,

in equation (6) which can then be rewritten as

d2
d2

() = 


8 g c

(1 + 1  2c)2

sn2(, l)  2

on the other hand, from (5) we have

  m 2
)

q1 + 1  2c 

e

(1 + 1  2c)


().

(8)

c =

.

thus (8) reduces to

() =  4

(m 2

  m 2
)

(1 + l) 

e(1 + l)

(9)

(10)

this dierential equation has some important special properties. since g and  are positive

we can write, without lost of generality

4

g
  n(n + 1),

where n is a positive real number.

so, the above equation can be rewritten as

d2
d2

() =  n(n + 1)l sn2(, l) 

(m 2

  m 2
)
m 2


(1 + l) 

e(1 + l)

2

! ().

(11)

(12)

this is a generalized lame dierential equation. in the literature the general form of this

type of equation is given by [9]

d2

d2 () = (cid:16)n(n + 1) k2 sn2(, k) + c(cid:17) (),

where n is a positive real number, k2 is the parameter of the jacobian elliptic function sn, and
c is an arbitrary constant.

(13)

4

comparing (12) with (13), we obtain

c = (  1)(1 + l) 

e(1 + l)

2

,

where we dened the adimensional mass ratio parameter   m 2


m 2


. for the purpose we have

in mind we only consider in this work the case that n is a positive integer. the case with n

real, although more interesting, leads to eigenvalues which are dicult to calcule exactly and a

full numerical treatment is necessary in order to obtain the eingenvalues we are interested to.

for n integer the equation (12) or (13) is called simply lame dierential equation and can be

solved analiticaly. so, our results can be used also as a test for the numerical solutions of more

realistic cases which do not have exact solutions.

for n a positive integer the general solution of eq.(12) is given by

(p) = a em

n (p) + b f m

n (p),

where a and b are arbitrary constants and em
n (p) are lame functions of the rst
and second kind respectively [9]. the parameter m ranges on {n,n + 1, ..., n  1, n} and
p = sn2(, l). also, from reference [9], it is easy to prove that f m
n (p)   for p  0. since we
want the solution  be bound, we must take b = 0. so the solution reduces to

n (p) and f m

(p) = a em

n (p).

(14)

since we are interested only in the eigenvalues, in the following we drop the arbitrary

constant from the eigenfunctions (14).

below we show the rst eigenfunctions (n = 0, 1, 2, 3) of eq. (12) which are given by lame

2 (for n = 1). as a consequence weak coupling (g  

functions. of course by eq. (11) there is a minimum strengh for the coupling constant namely,
g = 
2 ) will not be studied here. on the
other hand, strong coupling (n  ) leads to a new and more complicated lame functions.
in this work we analyse only the case for n small, that is, coupling constant not too big. we

will see that, yet for these few cases a rich phenomenology for the bound energy levels emerges.

iii. eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of -field

using the results from reference [9] for em

n (p), the eigenfunctions (p) (14) and their eigen-

values for eq.(12) are given by

iv. eigenvalues for dirichlet boundary conditions

now, imposing dirichlet boundary conditions at x =  l

2 on the solutions s above, we

obtain relations for l  l(l). using, in each case, the form dened in [9], namely

h =

1
l

c,

where h corresponds to the eigenvalues obtained above, and making the change of variable
2 = (e2)

, we obtain the energy eigenvalues 2, i.e.:

2 m 2

case i: n = 0 (g = 0)

1) 2 =  m 2
.

but, this is not a valid result, since for g = 0 the lagrangian density of the eld  describe

a free particle which has positive eigenvalues. so, n = 0 will be discarded in this work.

case ii: n = 1 (g = 
2 )

1) 2

observe that in this case 2

1 does not depend on l.

where l satises

2) 2

2(l, ) = (

1
1 + l  )m 2
,

ml = 21 + lk(l).

note that the l = l(l) solution of this equation is not the same to that one from (7). as

previously mentioned, we are interested to obtain energy eigenvalues of eld  with the same
l = l(l) used for eld . thus 2

2 must be discarded for the case n = 1.

3) 2

3(l, ) = (

l

1 + l  )m 2
,

sn2(

ml
21 + l

, l) =

1
l

.

(32)

(33)

where l satises

since sn2( ml
2l+1

, l)  1, it is possible show from this relation, that l  1. since l  (0, 1],

only l = 1 (l = ) is solution of the eq. (33).

case iii: n = 2 (g = 3

2 )

where l satises

or

1) 2

1(l, ) = (

4 + l
1 + l  )m 2
,

ml = 41 + lk(l)

ml = 21 + lk(l).

(34)

(35)

(36)

notice, that in this case only the eq. (35) satises the condition that the same l = l(l)

must be used for both elds  and . according to this, equations like (36) will be discarded

in our further study of the energy eigenvalues of the eld .

on the other hand, in [7] was determined a minimum value for the relation ml, when
l  0, namely, 2. using (7) or (35), this result it can be veried easily. likewise observe
from (9) that if l  0 then c  0 and consequently by (4) we have that   0. so, below the
minimum value ml = 2 the eld  vanishes. therefore, in our calculation the only consistent
eigenvalues are those that satisfy the condition ml  2, that is, where the eld  there exist.

9

we now turn to the calculation of the energy eigenvalues for eigenfunctions i (i = 2, 3, 4, 5).
imposing in each case dirichlet boundary conditions, we obtain the eigenvalues

with l satises (35) or also

2) 2

2(l, ) = (

4 l + 1
1 + l  )m 2
,

sn2(

ml
2l + 1

, l) =

1
l

.

here as in the case of the eq. (33), only l = 1 (l = ) is solution of this equation.

3) 2

3() = (1  )m 2
,
3 is independent of l and therefore of l.

observe that 2

where l satises

4) 2

4(l, ) = (

,

sn2(

, l) =

1

1 + l + l2  l + 1

.

(37)

(38)

(39)

(40)

(41)

as l  (0, 1], from (41) we have that the values of ml belongs to the interval (1.57, 1.86).

so, the eigenvalue 2

4 is not a consistent solution for this case ml < 2.

where l satises

1

1 + l  l2  l + 1

.

(42)

(43)

as in the case of the eq. (38), this relation has an only solution, namely, l = 1 (l = ).

case iv: n = 3 (g = 3)

1) 2

1(l, ) = (

2l + 5 + 2l2  l + 4

 )m 2

with l satisfying an equation similar to (36) and

sn2(

ml
2l + 1

, l) =

1

l + 2 + l2  l + 4

.

10

(44)

(45)

from this equation is possible show that ml belongs to the interval (1.04, 1.36). so, the

eigenvalue 2

6 is not a consistent solution since ml satises (36) and from (45), ml < 2.

2) 2

2(l, ) = (

5l + 2 + 24 l2  l + 1

or

sn2(

.

(47)

observe that the rst equation is satised only for l = 1 (l = ), and for the second
equation is possible show that ml belongs to the interval (1.36, 1.91). thus this equation will
not be considered since ml < 2.

3) 2

3(l, ) = (4  )m 2

3 is independent of l and therefore of l.

in this case 2

with l satisfying (35) and

in this case, also it is possible show that only l = 1 (l = ) is solution of (50).

(56)

from this equation is possible show that ml belongs to the interval (2.04, 2.92). thus this

must be discarded since ml < 2.

in the next section, we will study the behavior of the energy eigenvalues 2, for a xed
 (mass ratio parameter) and changing continuously the external parameter of the theory
l  l(l).

v. level shifts induced by box size changing and

condensates

from the previous results we have discarded the cases n = 0 and n = 1. for the cases

n = 2 and 3 we have the following non-trivial results. in all cases we xed dierent values for

the mass parameter . also we demand classical stability of the eigenfunctions i (i = 1, 2, 3).
classical stability will ensue that the energy eigenvalues 2

i are non-negative [4].

a) case n = 2 (g = 3

2 )

considering only the energy eigenvalues 2

i  0 in eqs. (34), (37) and (39) we obtain the

following relations:

i = 0.

it is interesting to note that (see fig. 2) for l = , 1 and 2 converge to q 3

for large box (l = ) the excited state of dashen-hasslacher-neveu (dhn) [6] is obtained.
likewise the ground state of (dhn) model also is obtained, i.e., 3 = 0. this can be proved

13

directly from eq. (6) taking l = 1. nevertheless the eq. (6) or its equivalent eq. (12) has an

aditional freedom by varying the parameter .

the fig. 2 shows that for l  0 (ml  2) [7], the energy eigenvalues 2+ and 2

antiparticle condensate can be induced by the external parameter l (box size). this is not the
case, because l  0 implies by eqs. (4) and (5) that  = 0 and so no interaction lagrangian

its classical conguration is unstable in this interval. also observe that now a condensate

occurs for a bigger size (not he minimal) of the box. a full proof of this requires a second

quantization at least for the eld  in a semiclassical aproach. it is well known that inclusion

not pursued here, since our aim is just to show the behavior energy levels for elds (in classical

limit) placed inside boxes, for a very simple geometry like an interval in (1 + 1) dimension. for

the increasing of the mass parameter  leads to a formation of a condensate more and more

we can see from these relations that all the energy eigenvalues are negative (for l 6= 0) and

therefore their classical congurations will be unstable.

it is interesting to note that for   [2, 3] the 2 disappears for   5

2 and for 5

2 <  < 3

only 1 survive and it is easy to see from fig. 4 above that its behavior is inverse of 2.

we conclude that, in this case n = 2, there will be formation of a condensate for the
energy eigenvalues 1 or 2 for   (1, 4). these condensates are obtained by squeezing the
box.

b) case n = 3 (g = 3)

for the case n = 3 the results are pretty the same for its seven bound energy levels.

however, in this case, only the eigenfunctions given by eqs. (26), (27) and (30) with respective

energy eigenvalues given by eqs. (48), (49) and (55) satisfy the condition (7). the only great
dierence is that there is no condensate when the mass ratio parameter   (4, 6). in fact

16

the condensate only exists for   (1, 4] or   [6, 9).

another interesting point, as showed in [7], is that imposing periodic boundary conditions
at x =  l
2 on the eld , the same relation (7) is obtained and therefore all results from the
dirichlets case keep valid. also imposing periodic boundary conditions at x =  l
2 on the
solutions s, it is possible to show that for the case n = 2, the eigenfunctions given by eqs.
(19), (20) and (21) lead to the same relation for l  l(l) given by (7). in same way, for the
case n = 3, the eigenfunctions given by eqs. (26), (27) and (30) also lead to (7). therefore all

results of the dirichlet case are valid.

vi. conclusions

in this work we studied the energy eigenvalues 2 of a classical scalar eld  in (1 + 1)
dimension interacting with another classical scalar eld  through the lagrangian lint = g22,
in a nite domain (box of size l). the energy eigenvalues depend on four parameters, namely,

 (mass ratio parameter), coupling constants  and g, and l (which is connected with the box

size l). we xed the coupling constant g by eq. (11) for an arbitrary  and we studied only

the cases n = 0, 1, 2, 3, which correspond to a not too big interaction constant g related to .

the more general case of n real a full numerical treatment is necessary. next, we discussed
the behavior of the energy eigenvalues 2 by xing the parameter  and changing the external
parameter of the theory l  l(l).

in the case n = 2 (g = 

2 ), we concluded that the formation of a condensate for the energy
eigenvalues 1 or 2 occur for   (1, 4). these condensates are obtained as a consequence
of squeezing the box. also, we observe by figs. 2, 3 and 4 that by varying the mass ratio ,
while 1 forms its condensate more and more near the minimal size of the box l = 2
m
forms its one more and more far from this value.

, 2

for the case n = 3 (g = 3), we have seven bound energy levels. only three of them satisfy

the dirichlets boundary condition which in turn lead to eq. (7). their behavior are pretty the
same of n = 2, but the condensate only exists for   (1, 4] or   [6, 9). so there is a gap
in the set of possible values of the parameter . for periodic boundary conditions all results

obtained with dirichlets boundary conditions keep unchangeable. of course other boundary

conditions can be imposed leading to new behaviors of the energy levels under box squeezing.

several interesting extensions and approaches can be pursued from the above work. as

stressed in the introduction, elds placed in cavities lead to new and sometimes unexpected

behavior of some systems. although our approach is for classical elds it suggest that a quan-

tization of the system above studied could lead to formation of condensate just by squeezing

the system in a box. of course this would require a semiclassical approach which will be done

17

elsewhere. a more interesting case would be the inclusion of non-linearities for the classical

eld , which leads to well known condensate for unbound domains [10], but now in nite

domains. also in this case we think a full numerical treatment is needed.

generalization of the above results to 3 spatial dimensions leads to more complex equations,

not to mention that we have, in this case, an enormous (innite to be sure) variety of geometries

for the shape of the box. nevertheless these kind of calculations for spherical symmetry could

be interesting in order to study for example bound states behavior of matter elds in compact

stars.
