abstract

the relevance of calibrations, and generalized calibrations, to super-
symmetric m-brane congurations, and their associated eld theories, is
reviewed, with emphasis on applications to domain walls and domain wall
junctions of d=4 n=1 supersymmetric eld theories.

minimal surfaces have long been an active area of mathematics. with the advent
of the brane revolution they have become important to theoretical particle physics
via m-theory. an important development on the mathematical side was the introduc-
tion in 1982 of the concept of a calibration [1]. in the simplest cases this deals with
p-surfaces w immersed in en. the immersion induces a metric m on w, and hence a
p-volume scalar density det m. the tangent space at each point of w is spanned by
a basis set of p vector elds on en. in the neigbourhood of any point on w we can
choose this basis set to be {/i; i = 1 . . . p}, so that the i are local coordinates
for w. the antisymmetrized tensor product of these vector elds, which determines
the orientation in en of the tangent p-plane , is the local expression for a p-coform 
which can be contracted with any p-form  on en to yield a scalar   . the p-form
 is a calibration if, for all ,
(i)     1
(ii) d = 0
because en is at2, each tangent plane of w denes a point on the grassmannian
so(n)/[so(p)  so(n  p)] of p-planes through the origin of en. each p-coform 
is associated with a subset of these p-planes. the subset for which the calibration
inequality (i) is saturated is called the contact set of the calibration. a surface for
which all tangent p-planes belong to this contact set is called a calibrated p-surface.
a theorem of harvey and lawson states that a calibrated p-surface has minimum
p-volume among all p-surfaces with the same homology [1]. that is, it is a minimal
p-surface.

the proof of this theorem is elementary. consider an open set u of a surface
satisfying the premise of this theorem. since the calibration inequality (i) is saturated,
by hypothesis, we have

vol(u)  zu

dp det m = zu

dp det m    .

(1)

but the scalar density det m    is the hodge dual on w in the induced metric m

of the p-form induced on w by , so a calibrated p-surface has the property that

vol(u) = zu



(2)

for any open set u. now consider any other p-surface that coincides with the original
one on the boundary u of u, and let u  be an open set of this new surface with
u  = u. since we only consider surfaces within the same homology class there
exists a (p + 1)-surface d such that d = u  u . it follows that

zu

 = zu 

 + zd

d .

(3)

2obviously, there is no path-independent means of comparing the tangent p-planes of a p-surface
in a generic n-dimensional riemannian manifold but a modied theory exists for spaces of reduced
holonomy.

the second term on the right hand side vanishes by property (ii). rewriting the rst
term we then have

zu

 = zu 

dp det m     zu 

dp det m  vol(u )

(4)

where the inequality follows from property (i). putting together (2) and (4) we
conclude that

the theorem then follows from the fact that this is true for any choice of u.

vol(u)  vol(u ) .

(5)

the applicability of this theorem to branes [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] relies on the fact that in
many cases of interest the energy of a static p-brane is proportional to the p-volume
of its worldspace w, the constant of proportionality being the p-volume tension t .
there are, however, many cases in which the energy is not simply the p-volume.
obvious examples are d-branes and the m5-brane which have gauge-elds on their
worldvolume. the theory of calibrations is still applicable in these cases when (if
consistency allows it) one restricts attention to congurations for which worldvolume
gauge elds vanish. discounting worldvolume gauge elds, the bosonic p-brane action
takes the universal form

s = t zw

[vol(g) + a]

(6)

where vol(g) is the (p+1)-volume form in the metric g induced on the worldvolume w
swept out by the worldspace w in the course of its time evolution, and a is a (p+1)-
form induced on w from a background (p+1)-form. for stationary backgrounds one
has a timelike killing vector eld k for which lka vanishes (in some choice of gauge).
this generates a symmetry of the p-brane action for which there is a corresponding
noether energy. for static branes3 in static backgrounds the energy density is

h = t h

k2det m + i

(7)

where  is the worldspace dual of ika, and hence a type of electrostatic energy
density associated with the background gauge potential a.
if  vanishes then a
minimal energy p-brane is a minimal p-surface, in an appropriately rescaled metric
unless k2  1. if  does not vanish then a brane of minimal energy is not a minimal
surface. however, in this case one can invoke a theory of generalized calibrations
[8, 9] (not to be confused with generalizations involving non-vanishing worldvolume
gauge elds [10, 11]) .

a generalized calibration is a p-form satisfying

(i)     k2
(ii) d = ik(da)
for simplicity we shall assume here that k2  1, and refer to [9] for the general
case. in this case, property (i) reduces to property (i) and the same arguments as
before lead to

vol(u)  vol(u ) + zd

d .

(8)

3see [7] for a discussion of calibrations in relation to non-static branes.

2

but we can write

zd

d = zu

  zu 



and thus deduce the generalized bound

vol(u)  zu

  vol(u )  zu 

 .

using property (ii) this becomes

e(u)  e(u )

(9)

(10)

(11)

where e is the integral of the energy density h of (7), with k2  1. this illustrates
the general result of [9] that the contact set of a generalized calibration is a minimal
energy p-surface.

generalized calibrations are needed to study supersymmetric branes in those su-
pergravity backgrounds for which the electrostatic energy density  is non-vanishing.
in this contribution i will limit myself to supergravity backgrounds for which  van-
ishes, and for which the background metric is at, so that k2  1. in such cases
only the standard calibrations are needed. i will begin by explaining how, in these
simple circumstances, the calibration bound (i) follows from the p-brane supersym-
metry algebra; i refer the reader to [9] for the general case. a super p-brane in a
vacuum background is invariant under supertranslations of superspace. this invari-
ance implies the existence of spinorial noether charges q, in addition to the energy
and momentum. as this symmetry is a rigid one, the charges in any region u of the
brane are well-dened and must satisy the supertranslation algebra. when account
is taken of the p-form central charge in the spacetime supertranslation algebra [12],
one nds that

{q, q} = zu hvol(m)  0i1...ipdx i1  . . .  dx ipi

(12)

where vol(m) is the volume p-form in the induced worldspace metric m and x i are
the n-space coordinates. the values of p and n are restricted by supersymmetry, but
these restrictions are those required anyway for applications to m-theory. the values
of p and n are further restricted if we assume that the supercharges q are real. this
assumption is not essential but will be made here to simplify the presentation. the
matrices (0, i) are the dirac matrices of (1+n)-dimensional minkowski spacetime.
we now introduce a real, commuting, covariantly constant spinor , to be called

a killing spinor, normalized so that

t  = 1 .

(13)

the number of such spinors will always equal the number of supersymmetry charges
q. given such a spinor, (12) implies that

(q)2 = zu

[vol(m)  ] = zu

dp det m (1    ) ,

(14)

3

where

 =

1
p! (cid:16)t 0i1 ip(cid:17) dx i1      dx ip .

(15)

the left hand side of (14) is manifestly positive, and since this is so for any region u
we must have

    1

(16)

for all . it is also obvious, since  is covariantly constant, that d = 0. we conclude
that  is a p-form calibration. as we shall now see, the calibration inequality (16) is
saturated by congurations that preserve some fraction of the spacetime supersym-
metry.

the calibration just found from considerations of supersymmetry can be written

as

where  is the matrix

 = (det m) t 

 =

1

p!det m

i1...ip (cid:16)i1x i1 . . . ipx ip(cid:17) 0i1...ip .

given the restrictions on p and n mentioned previously, it can be shown that

2 = 1 .

(17)

(18)

(19)

the eigenvalues of  are therefore 1, and the bound (16) is an immediate conse-
quence of this. as we have already derived this bound, the more relevant point here
is that the condition for its saturation is

 =  .

(20)

this is the key equation for what follows4. for many simple applications we may
choose coordinates for which the covariantly constant spinor  is constant. for sim-
plicity, let us suppose that such coordinates have been chosen and that  is constant.
the matrix  will not be constant, in general, because it will depend on the tangent
p-plane  at the point at which it is evaluated. let us call this matrix , and let s +

be the +1 eigenspace of . the space of solutions to (20) is then the intersection of
the spaces s +
 for all p-planes  that are tangent to the p-brane. for a generic p-brane
this space is the empty set and there are no non-zero solutions of (20), but for special
cases there will be a non-empty intersection. to take a trivial example, a planar
brane has only one inequivalent tangent p-plane and the space of solutions to (20)
has a dimension equal to half the number of supersymmetry charges. in other words,
a planar brane is 1/2 supersymmetric. non-planar branes will generally preserve less
than 1/2 supersymmetry. as we go from one point on the p-surface to another we go
from one p-plane  to another p-plane  . correspondingly,

4the lagrangian version of this equation was originally derived in [13, 14] from considerations

    = r1r ,

(21)

of kappa-symmetry. the derivation here follows [9].

4

where r is some so(n) rotation matrix in the spinor representation. the p-surface
will be a calibrated one only if there exist non-zero solutions  to r = , because
only in this case will s +

  have a non-empty intersection.

 and s +

in the context of m-theory,  is a 32 component majorana spinor of so(1, 10),
which is real in a real representation of the dirac matrices. for static solutions we
may consider  to be a spinor of so(10), so n  10. preservation of some non-
zero fraction  of supersymmetry by a static m-brane conguration requires r to
take values in a subgroup g of so(n)  so(10) such that the decomposition of the
spinor representations of so(n) contained in the spinor of so(10) includes at least
one singlet. if the total number of singlets is 32 then the conguration will preserve
the fraction  of supersymmetry; it is -supersymmetric. the subgroups of so(10)
with the required property are

su(5)  so(10)
spin(7)  so(8)
su(4)  so(8)
g2  so(7)
su(3)  so(6)
su(2)  so(4)

(22)

for each supersymmetric, and hence calibrated, p-surface the tangent planes must
parameterize a coset space g/h, where g is the rotation group discussed above and
h is some stability subgroup. the groups g and h, together with the dimension p
of the calibrated surface, provide a classication [4, 5, 6] of the calibrations relevant
to supersymmetric congurations of m5-branes5. these are shown in table 1.

the simplest realization of these possibilities is via orthogonally intersecting m5-
branes. here i will follow the approach of [5]. consider, for example, two m5-branes

5there are additional cases when one includes m2-branes [4, 9]. see [15] for a comprehensive

review.

intersecting according to the array

7   

each m5-brane determines a tangent p-plane , and hence an associated matrix 
with +1 eigenspace s +
 . the intersection of these spaces can be shown, by standard
methods, to be 8-dimensional, so the conguration preserves 1/4 supersymmetry and
must be a calibrated conguration. the 1-2-3 directions, separated from the others
in the above array by the vertical line, are common to both m5-brane worldvolumes.
they play an inessential role and may be ignored, as may the transverse 8-9- di-
rections (following [16], we use  as a convenient single character for ten), so we
eectively have two intersecting 2-branes in e4. the 2-brane in the 6-7 transverse
directions may be considered as a solitonic deformation of a test brane in the 4-5
directions. from this perspective, the orthogonal intersection of the two 2-branes is
a singular limit of a conguration of a single 2-brane, which can be considered as
an elliptic curve in c2, asymptotic to the two orthogonal 2-planes in the 4-5 and 6-7
directions. either plane can be obtained from the other by a discrete su(2) rotation
in c2. such rotations preserve 1/4 supersymmetry [17]. we can desingularize the
intersection, while maintaining 1/4 supersymmetry by allowing a continuous su(2)
rotation from one asymptotic 2-plane to another. we then have a non-singular elliptic
curve which, because it preserves 1/4 supersymmetry, must be a calibrated 2-surface.
it must be calibrated by an su(2) kahler calibration as this is the only case with the
required properties, the kahler and special lagrangian calibrations being equivalent
for su(2).

this conclusion can be conrmed directly from the constraints imposed on killing
spinors by two orthogonally intersecting m5-branes [5]. let us consider here the
simpler case of two orthogonally intersecting m2-branes because the three common
directions of the two m5-brane are irrelevant to the nal result. we take the m2-
branes to intersect according to the array

the calibration form (15) in this case is the 2-form

 =

xi,j=1(cid:16)t 0ij(cid:17) dxi  dxj .

the constraints imposed on the killing spinors by the two m2-branes are

012 =  ,

034 =  .

these imply

12 = 34 ,

13 = 24 ,

14 = 25 ,

(23)

given the normalization (13) of , we then nd that

t 013 = 0

t 014 = 0 .

 = dx 1  dx 2 + dx 3  dx 4 .

(26)

(27)

introducing the complex coordinates x 1 +ix 2 and x 1 +ix 2 we see that  is a kahler
2-form on e4. its form is preserved by su(2) acting on the doublet (dz, du). the
calibration is therefore an su(2) kahler calibration.

the same conclusion can be reached for m5-branes via a similar analysis of the
constraints imposed on killing spinors (after factoring out from the 5-form of (15)
the volume 3-form of the three common directions). but these constraints apply to
a much wider class of congurations than orthogonally intersecting m5-branes. in
particular, they apply to any 1/4 supersymmetric conguration of a single m5-brane
that is asymptotic to the conguration of orthogonally intersecting m5-branes. the
asymptotic planes may also be rotated relative to each other (see [6] for a discus-
sion of calibrations in this context). one may consider the array as a shorthand
for the entire collection of such congurations. pushing this interpretation to the
extreme, one may regard the array as nothing more than a tabular representation
of the constraints (24), so that it may be considered to represent any conguration
yielding these constraints regardless of the asymptotic behaviour. if an interpretation
this liberal is adopted then the geometry of the array may suggest results that are
spurious in particular contexts, but one may still hope to capture general features
common to all cases. we shall return to this point below when discussing the asso-
ciative and cayley calibrations, but we rst need to consider a simpler case with 1/8
supersymmetry.

consider three m5-branes intersecting according to the array

m5 : 1 2 3 | 4
m5 : 1 2 3 |   6
m5 : 1 2 3 |     8

5     
7   
9 

each m5-brane determines a tangent p-plane , and hence an associated matrix 
with +1 eigenspace s +
 . the intersection of these spaces can be shown, by standard
methods, to be 4-dimensional, so the conguration preserves 1/8 supersymmetry and
must be a calibrated one. the 1-2-3 directions, separated from the others in the
above array by the vertcal line, are common to all m5-brane worldvolumes. they
play an inessential role and may be ignored, as may the transverse tenth direction,
so we eectively have three intersecting 2-branes in e6. the 2-branes in the 6-7 and
8-9 transverse directions may be considered, as before, as solitonic deformations of
a test brane in the 4-5 directions.
in this case the orthogonal intersection of the
three 2-branes can be considered a singular limit of a conguration of a single 2-
brane wrapped on an elliptic curve in c3, and asymptotic to the three orthogonal
2-planes in the 4-5, 6-7, and 8-9 directions. each of these planes can be obtained

7

from any of the other two by a discrete su(3) rotation in c3. such rotations preserve
1/8 supersymmetry [17]. we can desingularize the intersection, while maintaining 1/8
supersymmetry by allowing a continuous su(3) rotation from one asymptotic 2-plane
to another. we then have a non-singular elliptic curve which, because it preserves 1/8
supersymmetry, must be a calibrated 2-surface. it must be calibrated by an su(3)
kahler calibration as this is the only candidate with the required properties. this
can be veried as before.

in any conguration of intersecting branes there will generally be zero modes
trapped on the intersection and these will govern its low energy dynamics. in the
above example the intersection is 3-dimensional so the zero modes trapped on the
intersection yield a (3+1)-dimensional quantum eld theory. since the conguration
preserves 1/8 of the supersymmetry of the m-theory vacuum, the intersection eld
theory has a total of four supersymmetries, transforming as a real spinor of so(1, 3).
in other words, the low energy intersection dynamics is governed by a d=4 n=1
sqft. if the intersection is desingularized so as to describe a single non-singular
m5-brane then this sqft will be determined by the m5-branes eective action. the
sqft obtained in this way from three orthogonally-intersecting m5-branes is not of
particular interest in itself, but any minimal energy m5-brane wrapping a riemann
surface in a at m-theory vacuum is also calibrated by an su(3) kahler calibration,
and various sqfts can be thus obtained. a particularly interesting example in which
an m5-brane wraps a riemann surface in the s 1-compactied m-theory vacuum was
identied in [18] as a theory, now called mqcd, with properties similar to that of
sqcd.

an example of an associative calibration is provided by four m5-branes intersect-

ing according to the array [5]

ignoring the common directions, and the transverse tenth direction, and interpreting
the last three rows as solitonic deformations of a test 3-brane in the 3-4-5 direc-
tions, we conclude that we have a calibrated 3-surface in e7. since this conguration
preserves 1/16 supersymmetry, it must be calibrated by a 3-form, and the associa-
tive 3-form calibration is the only candidate. we might wish to relate this to a d=3
sqft, but there is an alternative application. noting that this array can be obtained
from the previous one by the addition of a fourth m5-brane, we retabulate it as

m5 : 1

if the rst three m5-branes are interpreted as supplying a d=4 n=1 sqft with coor-
dinates (x0, x1, x2, x3) then the array suggests that we interpret the fourth m5-brane
as a domain wall in this theory. the 1/16 supersymmetry of associative calibrations
of an m5-brane translates to 1/2 supersymmetry of the d=4 n=1 minkowski vac-
uum; in other words, the domain wall is a 1/2 supersymmetric bps wall. this is a
simple analogue of wittens identication of associative calibrations of the m5-brane
of mqcd as 1/2 supersymmetric domain walls [18].
it has been known for some
time [19] that the wz model admits 1/2 supersymmetric domain walls for an ap-
propriate superpotential (the solutions having been studied originally as solitons of
the dimensionally-reduced n=2 d=2 sqft [20]). they also appear in su(n) sqcd
with n  2 [21] because the low eective action includes a wz action with a su-
perpotential admitting n isolated critical points and hence n degenerate vacua [22].
minimal energy congurations that interpolate from one vacuum to another are 1/2
supersymmetric domain walls. it should therefore be no surprise that mqcd admits
similar domain walls, although their geometrical nature (and the fact that they are
d-branes [18]) is remarkable.

it has recently been appreciated that the domain walls of wz models, and hence
of sqcd, may intersect at junctions, the conguration as a whole preserving 1/4
supersymmetry [23, 24]. the junction of two domain walls is 1-dimensional. let z be
a complex coordinate for the plane orthogonal to this direction. the 1/4 supersym-
metric domain wall junctions of the wz model are congurations (z) of a complex
scalar eld satisfying

d
dz

= w () ,

(28)

where the superpotential w is a holomorphic function of . the 1/2 supersymmet-
ric domain walls themselves are special solutions of this equation with translational
symmetry along one direction in the z-plane, but the generic solution is 1/4 super-
symmetric. in the case that

w  = 1  3 ,

(29)

corresponding to a quartic superpotential, there are three vacua with  = (1, , 2)
where  is a cube-root of unity. in this case we expect a z3-symmetric junction, as
shown in fig. 1. although no exact solution to (28) of this type is known, numerical
studies suggest that one exists [25] and the existence of a z3-invariant minimum energy
domain wall junction solution to the second order wz equations with superpotential
(29) has been proved [26]. in addition, an exact solution representing a domain-wall
junction has recently been found in a more complicated, but related, model [27]. it
seems clear from these results that 1/4 supersymmetric domain wall junctions are
generic to d=4 n=1 sqfts. in particular they are expected in su(n) sqft for
n  3 [28].
this raises an obvious question. does mqcd have 1/4 supersymmetric domain
wall junctions and, if so, what is their geometrical realization? a suggestion of
gauntlett, which will be explored in a forthcoming article [29], is that domain wall
junctions of mqcd are cayley calibrations of the mqcd m5-brane. this can be

this conguration preserves 1/32 supersymmetry, corresponding to 1/4 supersym-
metry of the d=4 n=1 vacuum dened by the rst three m5-branes. if the last two
m5-branes are viewed as excitations about this vacuum then it is apparent from the
array that they can be interpreted as intersecting domain walls.
