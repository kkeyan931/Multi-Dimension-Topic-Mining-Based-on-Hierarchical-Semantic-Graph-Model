search for periodic vacuum in qed2

abstract

it is shown that the vacuum of qed2 in minkowski spacetime does
not favour a periodic electric mean eld. the projected eective action
exhibiting a genuine dependence on the non-vanishing background eld
has been introduced. the functional dependence of the energy den-
sity of the vacuum on the assumed periodic vacuum expectation value
of the vector potential is determined from the component t 00 of the
energy-momentum tensor at one-loop order. treating the background
eld non-perturbatively, the energy of the vacuum in the presence of a
periodic mean eld is found not be equal to the negative of the eective
action.

1 introduction

it is
it is well-known that the perturbative vacuum of qed is trivial, i.e.
characterized by the vanishing expectation value of the electromagnetic vec-
tor potential. our goal is to investigate the vacuum non-perturbatively in the
framework of the continuum theory in minkowski spacetime. as a working hy-
pothesis we assume the presence of a periodic electric background eld. the
interaction of the fermions with the background eld is treated exactly by inte-
grating out the fermion elds, whereas the quantum uctuations of the electro-
magnetic eld are taken into account at one-loop order. the non-perturbative
treatment of the interaction with the background introduces innitely many
non-renormalizable, i.e.
it may happen that
such vertices generate non-trivial, periodic (otherwise anti-ferromagnetic) vac-
uum structure. similar examples are known for yang-mills theories on the
lattice [1], where the existence of various anti-ferromagnetic vacua have been
established due to irrelevant interaction terms.

irrelevant interaction vertices.

our problem setting can also be motivated by the following intuitive pic-
in the presence of a background scalar potential a0 = a cos(x) with

ture.

overcritical amplitude a > m (with the rest mass of the electron m) local-
ized electrons of the dirac sea may tunnel into localized electron states of the
same energy above the mass gap (see fig. 1). therefore, the creation of a
certain amount of electron-positron pairs with the spatial separation of / is
imaginable. this might stabilize itself with a periodic charge density (but zero
net charge) and a periodic mean electric eld. the expected eect might be
destroyed due to the uncertainty principle. localisation in an interval /2
means a momentum and, consequently, an energy spread of order e = p
e p
and the eect may occur only if a >> m + e

2 projection method

it is not completely trivial to dene an eective action depending on a back-
ground eld a(x). the simple shift of the integration variable a(x) to
(x) = a(x) - a(x) is not the answer requested, since a dependence on
the background a(x) shall only occur due to terminating the loop expansion.

below we introduce an eective action exhibiting a genuine dependence on the
background eld.

our method of dening the sector of qed for eld congurations belonging
to quantum uctuations around a given vacuum expectation value ha(x)i
consists of the following steps:

1. projection to the sector with a given background eld. the generating

functional of qed in minkowski spacetime has the form:

zqed = z d dda expnisem[a, ] + isd[a, , ]o

(1)

with the vector potential a(x) ( = 0, 1, 2, 3) and the electron-positron
eld (x), where sem[a, ] and sd[a, , ] are the action of the electro-
magnetic eld and the dirac action, resp., in the covariant gauge with
the gauge parameter . let the vector n(x) be introduced in the space
of the vector potential congurations. multiply the integrand of the
generating functional by the factor 1 written in the form

1 = z dc (z dxan  c)

with  = t v the spacetime volume. then, we nd

zqed = z dcz 

qed[n, c],

where the functional

z 

qed[n, c] = z d dda expnisem[a, ] + isd[a, , ]o

(z dxan  c)

(2)

(3)

(4)

can be concieved as the generating functional of the sector belonging to
vector potential congurations in a hypersurface orthogonal to n(x).
the projected generating functional z 
qed[n, c] is gauge invariant for the
choice of n(x) satisfying the condition n(x) = 0. the projected
eective action sef f [n, c] is dened by

z 

qed[n, c] = exp {isef f [n, c]} .

(5)

for the choice n(x) = a(x) with a given background eld a(x) satis-
fying the lorentz condition  a(x) = 0, we obtain the eective action

3

for the sector belonging to the given background a(x).
introducing
the shifted integration variable (x) = a(x)  a(x), the projected
generating functional can be rewritten as

z 

qed[ a, c] = z dz d expnisem[ a + , ]o

exp(cid:26)i(cid:18)z dx a a +z dx a  c(cid:19)(cid:27)
z d d expnisd[ a + , , ]o .

(6)

2. identication of the background with the vacuum expectation value of the

vector potential. as to the next, it is required that

ha(x)i = a(x),

i.e.

hi = 0.

(7)

this condition is used to determine the constant c as the functional of
the vacuum expectation value of the vector potential ha(x)i.

for later use it is useful to introduce the external sources j(x), (x), and
(x) coupled to the quantum uctuation (x) of the vector potential, and to
the fermion elds (x) and (x), resp. then, we nd instead of eq. (6) the
expression

z 

qed[ a, c, j, , ] = z dz d exp(cid:26)is[ a + , , c] +z dxj(cid:27)

zf [a, , ]

(8)

with

s[ a + , , , c] = sem[ a + , ] + (cid:18)z dx a a +z dx a  c(cid:19) ,(9)

and

zf [a, , ] = z d d expnisd[ a + , , ]o .

(10)

3 projected eective action

the projected generating functional (6) denes the projected eective action
via eq. (5). we determine it in one-loop approximation, i.e. we replace the full
vector potential a(x) in the dirac action sd by the background eld a(x).

4

thus, the generating functional is factored into an electromagnetic part and a
fermionic part,

qed[ a, c, j, , ] = z 
z 

em[ a, c, j]zf [ a, , ].

(11)

the explicit forms of the actions are given as

sem[ a + , ] =

( ad1 a) +

(d1) + (d1 a),

(12)

and

sd[ a] = ( g1)

with the inverse of the photon propagator in lorentz gauge,

 (x, y) = hg x +(cid:16)1  1(cid:17) x
i (x  y),

and the inverse of the fermion propagator in the background eld a(x),

(13)

(14)

(15)

g1(x, y) = (cid:16)i(x

  i a(x))  m(cid:17) (x  y)

with the dirac matrices  ( = 0, 1, 2, 3). for the sake of simplicity, the

notation (f og) = r dxdyf a(x)oab(x, y)gb(y) is used, where a and b are either

lorentz or spinor summation indices. in the one-loop approximation the path
integrals are gaussian ones and can be performed explicitly, leading to

satisfying the lorentz condition.

the constant c can be determined by using the fact that

0 = z dz d




from this we nd that

exp(cid:26)is[ a + , , c] +z dxj(cid:27) .
c0 = z dx a a.

one establishes now for the one-loop eective action:

dirac vacuum and that of the free electromagnetic eld, resp. (see e.g.

p> denotes the summation over all non-negative single fermion energies k  0,

being the energy eigenvalues of the dirac equation in the external eld a(x).
the third term on the r.h.s. of eq. (23) is just the negative of the energy
density of the periodic electric background eld. the last term of the eective
action (22) gives a vanishing contribution to the action density in the innite
volume limit.

the meaning of the rst two terms of eq. (23) might lead one to the false
conclusion that the negative of the action density is equal to the energy density
of the vacuum, as it would happen if the background eld were constant [2].
determining the energy density from the energy-momentum tensor we will
show that the energy density does not equal the negative of the action density
for inhomogeneous background eld.

as 1+1 dimensional qed is a superrenormalizable theory, the action den-
sity is uv nite after subtracting the action density of the free vacuum sef f,f ree,
i.e. that of the vacuum in the absence of the background eld. this dierence

7

 = 1(sef f + sef f,f ree) has been calculated numerically by solving the
dirac equation for the single-fermion energies.

these energy eigenvalues show the same band structure plotted against the
momentum in g. 2 as the electrons in the kronig-penney model [3] because
of the periodic potential. fig. 3 shows how  changes by modifying the
amplitude a and the wavelength  of the potential. (the fermion rest mass is
chosen for m=1.) one can recapitulate from g. 3 that the surface (a, )
has only a single stationary point at the origin of the parameter space (a, ),
i.e.
the path integral dening the vacuum-vacuum transition amplitude is
dominated by the trivial, identically vanishing eld conguration a(x) = 0.

4 mean eld equation

the vacuum expectation value of the current can be written at one-loop order
in the following form:

h (x)(x)i = z dz deis
i a(x)

= eisef f "





i a(x)

zf (cid:30)z dz deiszf

eisef f  zf



i a(x)

z 

em# .

(24)

the rst term on the r.h.s. of eq. (24) is just the rst functional derivative
of the eective action sef f / a(x). in the innite volume limit the second
term gives:

ic2
0

 exp(
2( ad a))
a(x)
(d a)(x)   c0
 a(x)
= 2 a(x) =  f 

= 



i a(x)

exp( ic2

2( ad a))

0

 a(x)!

(25)

with the eld strength tensor f  evaluated from the background a. here
we used that

c0

 a(x)

= 2 a(x)

due to eq. (20). thus, one obtains the equation

h (x)(x)i =

sef f
 a(x)

+  f .

(26)

(27)

for the background eld conguration making the eective action extremum,
one recovers the vacuum expectation value of the maxwell equation. thus,
the eective action has an extremum at the background eld conguration
coinciding with the mean eld solution. in our numerical search, this is the
trivial extremum found at a =  = 0.

satisfying the necessary condition of the extremum of the eective action,
eq. (27) results in the poissons equation for the mean eld a0, which must
be considered together with coupled set of operator equations for the quantum
elds (x), (x) and (x). the latter equations should be solved and the
result substituted in the l.h.s. of eq. (27), in order to make the charge density
explicit.

corresponding to the action r dxl = s + sd and with the covariant derivative

d =   ia.

substituting the ansatz (19) one obtains for the component t 00 of the

energy-momentum tensor:

t 00 = t 00

em,2[] + t 00
+t 00

f [ a + , , ]

em,1[ a, , ] + t 00

em,0[ a] + t 00

 [ a, c]

(30)

where t 00
em,a (a = 0, 1, 2) are the terms independent of the fermion eld and
being of the order ()a. due to the constraint (7), the expectation value of
the rst order term vanishes, therefore it can be neglected. the second order
term

and represents the energy density of the periodic background eld. due to the
projection to a particular sector of the theory, the additional term

t 00

= (cid:18)(1z du a(u) a(u)  a(x) a(x)(cid:19)

occurs. it is easy to see that this term does not contribute to the energy, but
gives a non-vanishing periodic contribution to the energy density. finally, the
term

t 00
f = 

i
2

0(cid:16) 0(cid:17) + 0 hd( a + )

(34)

represents the contribution of the fermions to the energy density. the rst
term on the r.h.s. gives vanishing contribution to the total energy if charge
conservation is required, whereas the second term accounts for the kinetic
energy of the fermion system. at one-loop order, we have to substitute  = 0
in the hamilton operator, i.e. write

hd( a) = i0jx

j  0j aj(x) + 0m.

(35)

since aj(x) = 0 in our case, we obtain hd( a) = i0jx

j + 0m, i.e. the

free hamilton operator.

the vacuum expectation value of t 00 in the presence of the background

eld a is dened as

ht 00(x)i = z dz dd dt 00(x)ei(s+sd)(cid:30)z dz dd dei(s+sd)

(36)

similarly, the vacuum expectation value of t 00
ground eld ht 00

f ree in the absence of the back-
f ree(x)i0 is given by substituting a(x) = 0 in eq.(36) and

10

replacing t 00(x) by t 00
the background eld a(x) 6= 0 is

f ree(x). then, the casimir energy of the vacuum due to

ec = z dx1ht 00(x1)i z dx1ht 00

f ree(x1)i0

= z dx1h(l2a2/2) sin2(lx1) + h 0hd0i  h 0hd0i0i

(37)

this expression of the casimir-energy reminds one on the expression for the
energy of a system of electric charges in classical electrodynamics. there, the
energy is the sum of the energy of the electromagnetic eld and the kinetic
energy of the charges [4]. in our case the casimir energy is the sum of the
background electric eld and the change of the relativistic kinetic energy (in-
cluding the rest mass) of the dirac-sea due to the presence of the background
eld.

eq.(36) can be
qed[ a, c, j, , ] as
z 

rewritten by the help of the generating functional

qed[ a, c0](cid:17) t 00

ht 00(x)i = (cid:16)1/z 
where t 00
op (x) denotes the operator obtained from t 00 by replacing the elds
(x), (x), and (x) by the operators /j(x), / (x), and /(x) and
the variable  by i1/c.

qed[ a, c, j, , ](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)j,,=0;c=c0

op (x)z 

(38)

then, we nd

ht 00

 i =

1
2

a22(cid:16)2 cos2(x1)  1(cid:17) .

(39)

furthermore, the expectation value ht 00
the free electromagnetic eld. indeed, it holds for the second derivatives

em,2[]i is equal to the energy density of

= id

1 (x, y)z 

em|j=0,c0

(40)

2z 

em/j(y)j(x)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)j=0,c0

where d
1 (x, y) tends to the free propagator d(x, y) in the innite volume
limit, since the last term on the r.h.s. of eq. (18) is of the order 1. conse-
quently, the pure electromagnetic contribution to the casimir energy density
is given by

eem(x) = ht 00

em,0[ a] + t 00

 [ a, c0]i

=

1

a22 cos2(x1).

it is more cumbersome to evaluate the fermionic contribution ef (x) =
ht 00
f i  ht 00
f reei0 to the casimir energy density, where the energy density of the
free dirac vacuum is subtracted. since qed in dimensions 1 + 1 is superrenor-
malizable, the dierence turns out to be uv nite without further renormaliza-
tions. we perform the evaluation of the fermionic part of the casimir energy
in the second quantized formalism. then we can write ef = h0| : t 00
f : |0i
where |0i is the interacting vacuum (in the presence of the periodic back-
ground eld) and : . . . : denotes normal ordering with respect to the normal
vacuum (in the absence of the background eld). the evaluation is performed
in the following steps:

1. the fermion eld  is expanded in terms of the eigenspinors f (ks)(x1)
and g(ks)(x1) of the dirac hamiltonian hd( a) belonging to the energy
eigenvalues ks and ks, resp. here the quasi-momentum k  [/2, /2]
and the integer s  0 enumerating the bands are introduced.

2. then the creation and annihilation operators a

ks and aks, bks of these
stationary single particle states are expressed as linear combinations of
the creation and annihilation operators a
ks and aks, bks of the free
fermion states f (kr)(x1) and g(kr)(x1) of energies (0)
and (0)

kr , resp. in terms of the latter, the normal ordering is performed.

kr = qm2 + (k + r)2

ks, b

ks, b

3. finally, the normal ordered operator is reexpressed in terms of the oper-
ks and aks, bks and the vacuum expectation value with respect

ators a
to the vacuum in the presence of the background eld is taken.

ks, b

thus, one arrives to the following expression

figure 4: casimir energy per unit volume of the periodic vacuum in qed2.

establish from eq. (48) that the volume integral of the energy density is not
negative:

ef = xkrs(cid:26)0

(50)

by numerical calculations we were convinced (see fig. 4) that this expres-
sion of the energy only vanishes in case of a==0. this means that the casimir
energy ec of the vacuum is always positive if a non-vanishing periodic electric
background eld is assumed. thus, the vacuum of qed2 does not favour a
periodic mean eld energetically with respect to the normal vacuum.

6 necessary condition of energy minimum

the vacuum expectation value a0(x) is dened by the minimum of the energy
functional

t e[ a0(x)] = z dxht 00(x)i = z dxd(cid:16)t 00

em(x) + t 00

 (x) + t 00

f (x)(cid:17)e . (51)

14

the second term vanishes due to the explicit value of c0. thus, the necessary
condition of the energy minimum takes the form



 a0(x) z dy(cid:16)t 00

em,0[ a0(y)] +dt 00

f (y)e(cid:17) = 0.

the functional derivative of the rst term gives



 a0(x) z dy(cid:16)t 00

em,0[ a0(y)](cid:17) = 2 a0(x).

(52)

(53)

at one-loop order the fermionic contribution to the energy can be rewritten as

t ef = z dydt 00

f (y)e

= z 1

f [ a, 0, 0]z dyt 00

taking its functional derivative we nd

f,op(y) zf [ a, , ](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)==0

.

thus, we nd the following equation for the eld a0(x) minimizing the energy:

 f 0 = d (x)0(x)e + c0(x).

itr(0g(x, x)), determined via the propagator g(x, x) as a given functional
of a0(x), and a similar statement holds for c0(x).

a similar equation appears in the classical case when a certain charge
distribution moves in an electromagnetic eld. integrating out the eect of
the charged particle distribution it will result in a polarisation charge density
term beside the common charge density in the equation of motion for the

charge density, so minimizing the energy with respect to a0(x) leads to an
equation similar to that of poissons equation in a polarised medium. thus
eq. (57) can be solved directly for a0(x) in principle without the need for
solving any other equations. on the contrary to this the mean eld equation
(27) obtained by extremizing the eective action does not take the polarisation
of the vacuum into account, in order to do this we have to solve a system of
operator equations as well.

7 conclusions

the energy density of qed2 in the presence of a periodic mean eld is de-
termined from the energy-momentum tensor. for this purpose a projection
method is worked out which is applied to treat the mean electromagnetic eld
self-consistently. the projected eective action and the energy density of the
vacuum are derived at one-loop order, whereas the interaction of the electron-
positron eld with the periodic mean eld is treated exactly. it is established,
that the negative of the eective action must not be regarded as the energy
of the system if the background eld is not constant. it was shown that the
necessary conditions of the extremum of the eective action and the minimum
of the energy lead to dierent equations for the vacuum expectation value of
a0. eq. (27) obtained by extremizing the eective action is the vacuum expec-
tation value of the poissons equation that does not include the polarisation
of the vacuum due to one-loop radiation corrections. those are accounted for
by separate operator equations for the quantum uctuations of the electro-
magnetic eld and for the dirac eld. on the other hand eq. (57) obtained
by minimizing the energy functional includes the polarisation eects of the
vacuum.

the expectation value of the component t 00 of the energy-momentum ten-
sor was determined as the function of the amplitude a and wave number l of
the static periodic scalar potential a0(x1) = a cos(lx1). it is found that the
vacuum conguration with this periodic electric mean eld is not favoured en-
ergetically compared to the normal vacuum. the volume integral of the energy
density plotted against the amplitude a in fig. 4 shows that the energy of the

16

system increases with increasing a monotonically.

the result obtained contradicts to our naive expectation discussed in the
introduction. possibly, the reason is that the naive picture mentioned there
does not take into account the uncertainty principle i. e. for a certain  the
energy spread of a wave packet localized in an interval of  1/ could be much
larger than the amplitude of the potential and of course in this case our naive
picture is not valid any more. we set now forth our work looking for periodic
ground states at nite chemical potential.

a solution of the dirac equation in periodic

external eld

a.1. relativistic bloch waves

to get the projected eective action at one-loop order in eq. (22) we must nd
the fermionic single-particle energies, so we have to solve the dirac equation
in the presence of the potential (19):

(i(  ie a)  m) = 0.

(58)

we look for the solution of eq. (58) in the form of bloch waves corresponding
to the energy eigenvalues e:

 = eipsteipx



xn=

uneinlx = ( eipstf ps(x),

eipstgps(x),

if e = ps > 0
if e = ps > 0

(59)

inserting (59) into (58) we nd



xn=(cid:18)un(0(pnl)1m1) +

a
2

0(un+1+un1)(cid:19)ei(p+nl)xiet = 0. (60)

we get non-trivial solutions when the determinant of the matrix appearing next
to the dirac-spinors equals zero. if we had solved the schrodinger equation
in the presence of this sinusoidal potential, the form of the matrix would have
been tridiagonal which means that the diagonal and the neighouring diagonal
elements are nonzero. in relativistic case the matrix elements are replaced by
d dimensional  matrices but the structure of the matrix remains unchanged.

17

a.2. eigenvalues, eigenspinors

we cannot get the eigenvalues analitically because of the complicated structure
of the matrix but we can determine them as precisely as we wish. in numerical
calculations we work with matrices with nite dimension. using the well-
known identity [5]

det[a] = det(cid:18) p q

r s (cid:19) = det[p ] det[s  rp 1q]

(61)

we can reduce the problem of calculating the determinants of these d(2n +
1)  d(2n + 1) dimensional matrices to calculating four dimensional matrices
by identifying the upper left matrix element of the matrix under investigation
with p in eq. (61). (n denotes the number of u,i-s taken into account in eq.
(60).) using identity (61) 2n times we get a product of 2n determinants of
four dimensional matrices. we computed the determinant of eq.(60) as the
function of e and determined its zeros, corresponding to the energy eigenvalues
e = 

in order to evaluate  we have to sum the eigenvalues ps < 0 and
extract from it the sum of the negative eigenvalues of the free dirac equation.
this dierence will depend on the accuracy of the eigenvalues, the number of
the eigenvalues taken into account in the sum, the size of the chosen matrix
and, of course, the parameters of the potential, the amplitude a and the wave
number . we have to be convinced of the stability of the numerical calculation.
we increased the number of members in the sum and the numerical accuracy
of the determination of eigenspinors by choosing larger matrices as far as we
have seen that the energy dierence does not change signicantly.

to get the expectation value of the component t 00 of the energy-momentum
tensor we also have to determine the eigenspinors of the dirac equation (58).
we calculated them with the help of the eigenvalues by solving a system of
homogeneous linear equations (60) for the eigenspinors.
