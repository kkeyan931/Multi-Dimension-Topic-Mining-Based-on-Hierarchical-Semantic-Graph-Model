transformation, extended to the case of twisted boundary conditions. we show
how torus calorons (lt/ls small) are nahm dual to the torus instantons (lt/ls large).
holonomies are dual to the locations of constituents, this duality becoming exact in

1 introduction

the study of su(n) gauge elds on the torus has a long history (see ref. [1] for a recent
account). it was initiated by g. t hooft [2] who pointed out additional non-trivial topolog-
ical features, associated to what is known as twisted boundary conditions (tbc), describing
the presence of center-valued conserved uxes for non-abelian gauge elds. in particular,
the study of self-dual gauge eld congurations on the torus has become a challenging
problem. both within the nite volume hamiltonian and the nite temperature formula-
tions of non-abelian gauge theories they play an important role, and the main result of this
paper is a rather surprising detailed dual relationship between these solutions.

for non-zero twist, numerical methods based on the lattice formulation of gauge theories
strongly suggested the existence of non-abelian self-dual solutions for all torus sizes [3, 4].
indeed, existence of smooth solutions with one unit of topological charge (q) and any non-
trivial twist has been established rigorously [5], even though one can prove non-existence
for zero twist [6]. (for higher topological charges existence has been proven by taubes [7]
earlier). to date, however, no analytic expressions have been found for these non-abelian
solutions on the 4-torus. this contrasts with the situation for r4 (or s4), where one has
the algebraic adhm construction [8].

1

an important technique for studying self-dual gauge elds is the nahm transforma-
tion [9], which is particularly simple for the torus. it maps su(n) self-dual solutions of
charge q on the torus to su(q) self-dual solutions of charge n on the dual torus. the
mapping is an involution, i.e. applying the nahm transformation again brings one back to
the original gauge eld conguration. the only analytically known example of the nahm
transformation on the torus, based on a particular abelian solution [10], maps it onto it-
self [11]. nevertheless, the nahm transformation is believed to be an important ingredient
in leading to analytical results for the self-dual solutions.

a few strategies have been used to improve our understanding of this problem. one
follows from the consideration of mixed compact and non-compact directions t n  r4n.
under the duality transformation the non-compact directions collapse and the dual space
is an n-dimensional torus, thereby achieving a dimensional reduction. the most dramatic
example is that of n = 0, where the dual space collapses to a point, being the reason that the
adhm construction [8] is algebraic. the n = 1 case is relevant at nite temperature [12, 13]
for which the associated geometry is r3  s1. the case n = 3 was considered as a way to
circumvent the no-go theorem on q = 1, zero-twist congurations [14, 15]. this geometry
is relevant for the hamiltonian formulation of gauge elds on the spatial torus, with the
non-compact direction identied with time. the possibility of having q = 1 congurations
introduces an important additional simplication, since its nahm-dual connection is an
abelian gauge eld.

applying nahms transformation in the non-compact case demands some modica-
tions [11].
in particular, there appear a nite number of singularities where the nahm
transformed gauge eld is non-selfdual. these occur when the holonomy of the original
self-dual gauge eld (extended to u(n) by adding a curvature free abelian gauge eld,
which parametrises the coordinates of the dual torus) has a trivial eigenvalue. the holon-
omy is dened by the wilson loops winding non-trivially in the compact directions, when
taken to innity in the non-compact directions.

an important example of the appearance of these singularities in the nahm transforma-
tion is the case of calorons [12, 13], instantons at nite temperature. it was already known
from the early work of nahm [9] that the dual formulation involves a u(1) gauge eld on
the circle with suitable singularities. it was only recently that explicit expressions for the
q = 1 self-dual congurations on r3 s1 with non-trivial holonomy were obtained [16, 17].
in particular it was shown how the location of the singularities in the dual eld is related to
the holonomy (the polyakov loop at spatial innity). these non-trivial calorons reveal the
presence of constituent bps monopoles, hidden at trivial holonomy due the masslessness
of one of the monopoles.

another example recently analysed in detail is the q = 1 instanton conguration for
t 3  r with twisted boundary conditions in time [18]. there the location of the singu-
larities is determined by the holonomies (polyakov loops in the three directions of t 3) at
innite time. away from these singularities, the abelian nahm transformed eld is self-
dual and therefore satises maxwell equations. the singularities act as sources and can be
interpreted as point-like dyons carrying (equal) electric and magnetic charge.

it is interesting to ask oneself how these caloron and instanton congurations are ap-
proached from congurations on a torus, lt  l3
s, when sending either ls or lt to innity.
when nite, these congurations will be referred to as torus calorons and torus instantons

2

respectively. both types of congurations have been analysed in the past by means of
numerical methods. in [14] it was seen how some of the t 3  r congurations are the
limit of self-dual congurations on the 4-torus with twisted boundary conditions in time,
which are known to exist [5]. the q = 1 solution tunnels between vacua where some of the
holonomies have opposite signs. the non-existence of the q = 1 solution without twist was
understood as an obstruction for tunnelling between two vacua with the same holonomy.
the situation seems quite similar to the o(3) model on the cylinder, which turned out to
be tractable analytically [19].

the case of non-zero spatial twist was studied numerically even earlier. the basic
building block is a lump the twisted instanton carrying fractional topological charge
(q = 1
2 for su(2)) and which is well localised in time [3, 4, 20]. single twisted instanton
congurations arise for non-zero (so called non-orthogonal) twist, both in space and time,
and they have a well-dened limit as lt  . only their overall position is a free parameter,
so that in particular their scale is xed (to ls). higher topological charge congurations
look as superpositions of these twisted instantons, distributed in the time-direction [21, 22].
2 lumps also feature prominently in numerical studies that address how 4-torus
these q = 1
congurations approach the non-compact geometries of t 2  r2 [23].

finally, caloron congurations on a torus have been recently studied [24] on lattices
typically having ls/lt = 4 or higher. these torus calorons tted extremely well to the
innite volume analytic results.
interestingly, twist in the time direction enforces the
holonomy (when taking the limit ls  ) to have zero trace, which implies the constituent
monopoles of the caloron have equal mass. for spatial twists, however, the numerical
analysis of ref. [24] suggests that the constituent monopoles are forced to sit at xed
relative positions on the torus, but can have arbitrary masses (only constrained by the
total topological charge). one can also study one constituent monopole in isolation by
having suitable twists, both in space and time, such that it supports the q = 1
2 twisted
indeed in the limit lt/ls  0 this solution becomes time
instanton mentioned before.
independent and thus has to approach a single bps monopole. hence also in this limit the
twisted instanton - as the bps monopole - is the basic building block, but now arbitrarily
placed in space.

quite remarkably, as will be discussed in this paper, torus calorons are dual to torus
instantons, with either their space (for calorons) or time (for instantons) positions deter-
mined by the holonomies of their nahm dual. in the limit lt  , relevant for t 3  r, the
nahm dual has the limit lt  0 (setting ls = 1 = 1/ls for convenience). this means that
the non-abelian cores of the torus caloron shrink to zero and one is left with the abelian
eld discussed before. quite in the same way one can interpret the abelian dual of the
caloron in the limit ls   (here setting units by lt = 1, the nahm dual has ls  0) as
the limit in which the instanton cores have shrunk to zero. in both cases the non-abelian
eld is self-dual at all values of lt and ls, and the violation of the abelian self-duality in
the limiting case is thus due to ignoring the singular non-abelian cores of the constituents.
such understanding of the singularity may prove important for future analytic work in the
t 3  r case.

in our analysis, two ingredients play an important part. one is that for t 4 lattice
techniques have been developed [25] that allow us to study the nahm transformation
numerically. this was tested in a non-trivial example for su(2) with charge 2, which maps

3

to itself. this demonstrated that the method is precise enough to become a useful tool in
numerically analysing the properties of the nahm dualities. this charge 2 conguration
was actually composed from four q = 1
2 twisted instantons. as we will see, it is these
twisted instantons that are mapped on to themselves as they only have their position as a
free parameter.

the other ingredient is the recent formulation of the nahm transformation in the pres-
ence of twisted boundary conditions [26]. the nahm transform of an su(n), charge q
self-dual conguration is an su(n0q) conguration with topological charge q = n/n0,
where n0 is an integer depending on the twist. if the original twist is non-trivial the nahm
transform lives on a torus with non trivial twist. in essence the construction is related to
recognising twist as (for su(2)) half-periods for a larger torus, to which the usual nahm
transformation can be applied. remarkably, the dual conguration admits half-periods
as well, and the dual gauge eld can thus be formulated in terms of gauge elds with
twisted boundary conditions.
it is this that allows us to demonstrate that the q = 1
su(2) twisted instanton is mapped to itself under the nahm transformation.

2

alternative to the formulation in terms of doubling, one can introduce a suitable
avour group to compensate for the twist [27], with which the nahm transformation can
then be performed. again one might study half-periods in the resulting dual torus and
reach a self-dual conguration in a smaller torus (the nahm-dual torus) and with non-zero
twist (the nahm-dual twist) [26]. furthermore, it was shown that both formulations agree.
from the analytical point of view this method is more general and allows a simple and
compact characterisation of the nahm-dual torus and twist. this will be presented in an
appendix.

in this paper we will make a synthesis of all the results mentioned above, leading to
additional insight in self-dual gauge elds on the torus and their moduli spaces. in section
2 we will set up the formalism, whereas section 3 shows how the torus calorons and torus
instantons are related under the nahm transformation, illustrated explicitly by numerical
examples. we show that taking the appropriate limits, as discussed qualitatively in this
introduction, reproduces the known analytic results.

2 the nahm transformation with twist

let us consider a 4 dimensional torus. this can be dened as r4/ where  is a rank-four
lattice of points. let e() stand for four vectors (  {0, 1, 2, 3}) which can be chosen as
generators of . we will take in general a hypercubic torus lt  l1  l2  l3, for which
e(0) = (lt, 0, 0, 0), e(1) = (0, l1, 0, 0), e(2) = (0, 0, l2, 0) and e(3) = (0, 0, 0, l3). often we will
take l1 = l2 = l3  ls. for obvious physical reasons we will refer to the direction with
length lt as time and to the other three as space.

now consider su(n) self-dual gauge elds a(x) dened on this torus. they can be
looked at as elds dened on r4, periodic modulo gauge transformations under translations
by vectors a in the lattice . given any element of , a  e(s) = se() (s  z), we have
(our convention throughout this paper is that a(x) is hermitian)

a(x + a) = [a]a(x)  a(x) a(x) 

a(x) + i a(x) 

a(x)

,

(1)

4

where a(x) form a family of su(n) matrices, known as twist matrices. since the lattice
 is abelian, the matrices a(x) must satisfy the following consistency conditions

a(x + b) b(x) = e2in (a,b) b(x + a) a(x)

.

(2)

because the matrices belong to su(n), the factor exp(2i n (a, b)) must be an element of
the center zn . hence, n (a, b) is an antisymmetric bilinear form dened by its action on
the generators

n (e(), e()) =

,

(3)

n
n

where n is an antisymmetric matrix of integers dened modulo n, known as the twist
tensor. we will frequently refer to its elements in the form of two 3-vectors of integers:
ki = n0i and mi = 1

2ijknjk.

an important role in what follows will be played by the lattice 0, a sublattice of .
this is given by the elements a  , such that the associated gauge transformation a(x)
commutes (in the sense of the composition in eq. (2)) with all other b(x). equivalently

0  {a   | n (a, b)  z,

b  } .

(4)

the quotient group /0 is a nite abelian group. using the freedom to select a basis of 
such that n has the canonical frobenius form, one can show that the order of this group
is the square of some integer, n 2
0 . the integer n0 plays an important role in what follows
and depends only on the form n . it is clear that for trivial twist vectors ~k = ~m = ~0 mod n
(n (a, b)  z) one has 0 =  and n0 = 1.

now let us proceed to introduce nahms transformation [9, 6]. for that purpose add
a 4 parameter family of curvature free abelian gauge elds to the original self-dual gauge
eld, a(x) + 2zi. this family of u(n) gauge elds is still self-dual, as the curvature
is not aected by the addition. the zero-modes of the weyl equation in this background
satisfy

(5)
in this notation we associate to each four-vector c a 2  2 matrix c = c0 i22 + i ~c  ~
(with k the pauli matrices). the covariant derivative d is given by   ia(x). in the
absence of twist (~k = ~m = 0), the weyl spinors satisfy the boundary conditions:

z (x) = 0 .

(d  2iz)



z (x + a) = a(x)

z (x)

,

(6)

and the index theorem [28] implies that the number of solutions satisfying eqs. (5-6)
(labelled by ) is given by the topological charge q. then the nahm transformed gauge
eld is given by

 (z) = iz d4x 
a

z (x) 
z



z (x)

.

(7)

quite miraculously this is an su(q) self-dual gauge eld with topological charge n. fur-
thermore, the gauge eld is dened on a dual torus r4/, where  is the dual lattice of
.

with non-trivial twist (~k, ~m 6= 0) the boundary conditions shown in eq. (6) are no
z (x) takes values in the fundamental representation of su(n), which

longer valid, since 

5

transforms non-trivially under the center of the gauge group. two strategies were developed
in ref. [26] to deal with this. one involves adding avour and the other replicating the
original torus. both methods were shown to lead to the same nahm transformed gauge
eld.

for the avour construction one introduces the u(nf n) self-dual gauge eld a(x) 
inf nf . the enlargement of the colour space allows us to modify the twist matrices as
follows: a(x)  a(x)  (a). the nf  nf constant matrices (a) satisfy

(a) (a) = e2in (a,a) (a) (a)

.

(8)

in this way the new u(nf n) matrices a(x) have no twist, and the standard formalism
can be applied to them. the existence of solutions to eq. (8), known as twist-eaters, was
studied in the past [33]. the constant matrices (a) are known to exist provided nf is
a multiple of n0, the twist-dependent integer dened below eq. (4). the solutions form
an irreducible set provided the matrices are precisely n0  n0. furthermore, the solution
is unique modulo similarity transformations and multiplication by constants [33, 1].
if
we restrict to matrices belonging to u(n0) these constants are necessarily phases (a u(1)
representation of the lattice ). hence, we will consider nf = n0 and make a particular
choice of solutions (a). in the appendix we show how dierent choices of the twist eaters
correspond to translations in z of the nahm transformed eld.

we have reduced the problem to the situation without twist, for a u(n0n) self-dual
gauge eld dened on the torus r4/ with topological charge n = n0q. one can then
it will be a u( n )
construct the nahm transformed gauge eld in the standard way.
self-dual gauge eld with topological charge n0n, living on the dual torus r4/. the
construction is in terms of the solutions of the weyl equation in the background of the
u(n0n) gauge eld (adding 2zi). however, given the tensor product form of this gauge
eld, these zero-modes are seen to be solutions of the original u(n) weyl equation (5).
but the boundary condition, eq. (6), is replaced by

i

z (x + a) = a(x) 

ij(a) j

z (x)

,

(9)

where i, j are avour indices (taking n0 values). the index theorem tells us that the label
, running over the linearly independent solutions, takes n = n0q values. choosing these
solutions to form an orthonormal set, we can express the dual gauge eld as follows:

a

 (z) = i

n0

xi=1

z d4x i

z (x) 
z

i

z (x)

.

(10)

although this eld is in principle living on the torus r4/, in ref. [26] it is shown that it
possesses additional periodicities. hence, one can dene the nahm transform of the original
gauge eld with non-trivial twist as the restriction of the gauge eld given in eq. (10) to
the minimal torus, in which case it has non-trivial twist as well.
it can be shown that
this minimal torus is precisely r4/, where  = 0, the dual lattice of 0 (see eq. (4)).
this denition preserves the property that the nahm transformation is an involution, and
reduces to the standard construction for trivial twist. proofs are given in ref. [26]. a more
elegant, basis independent derivation is given in the appendix.

6

now we will explain briey what is the essence of the alternative construction, which
is directly related to our numerical implementation of the nahm transform. we can view
a(x) on r4/ as being dened on the 4 dimensional hypercube formed by the unit cell
(spanned by e()) of , with appropriated twisted boundary conditions. consider now a
sublattice  whose unit cell is obtained by duplicating the original hypercube in various
directions, in such a way that the net twist vanishes. so one denes a(x) on r4/, such
that its boundary conditions do no longer carry twist. a trivial way to achieve this is by
taking  = 0, whose unit cell contains n 2
0 unit cells of , but this is not a minimal
choice.

to determine  it is simplest to make a choice of generators for  such that n
takes the frobenius standard form with non-zero entries dened by n02 = n20 = q1 and
n31 = n13 = q2. we introduce p1 and p2 as the smallest positive integers such that
qipi/n  z. one duplicates the hypercube (p1  1) times in either the 0 or 2 direction and
(p2  1) times in either the 1 or 3 direction such that n0 = p1p2. further freedom arises
in case pi has non-trivial prime factors. the new gauge eld on r4/ has topological
charge n0q and no twist. now one can apply the nahm transformation, which maps to a
su(n0q) self-dual gauge eld of topological charge n, dened on r4/.

figure 1: we present a cross section through the 0-2 plane of the various lattices that
appear in the nahm transformation with twisted boundary conditions n02 = n20 = 1
2 , for which r4/0 is of the same size as the
on r4/. units are such that l2
original torus.
in this case n0 = 2 and the two choices for the minimal lattices with
twist are denoted by  and . the dual of the lattice 0 gives the torus on which the
nahm transformed gauge eld lives, with the same twist. duplications on the dual side
are identical, except for interchanging the roles of  and 0 (and less importantly  and
). when a symbol overlaps with dierent cells it belongs to all of those cells as a whole.

0 = l2

2 = 1

each choice of  will lead to a dierent set of zero-modes. this can only mean that the
resulting dual gauge elds are related by gauge transformation. gauge invariant quantities
have to agree when derived from the various choices of . but this means that the
smallest unit cell in terms of which these gauge invariant quantities can be reproduced, is
the intersection of the unit cells of all , which is precisely  = 0, the dual of 0 (in the
same way the unit cell of  is the intersection of the unit cells of all ). note that 0 is
the smallest sublattice of , that is also a sublattice of all possible choices of  (the unit
cell of 0 consists of n0 unit cells of  and therefore of n 2
0 unit cells of ). with the twist

7

in the standard form given above, 0 is obtained by duplicating the hypercube that denes
the original torus r4/, (p1  1) times in both the 0 and 2 directions and (p2  1) times in
both the 1 and 3 directions. in fig. 1 we elucidate this for the 0-2 plane with q1 = 1 and
p1 = 2.

this shows that a can be dened as an su(n0q) gauge eld on r4/0 [26] and has
topological charge n/n0. nevertheless, as is obvious in particular for n/n0 not an integer,
the unit cell of 0 cannot be without twist, i.e. a is also a gauge eld with twisted boundary
conditions. for su(2) in the case that the original twist is already in the frobenius
standard form (where the situation of fig. 1 applies in the 0-2 and/or the 1-3 planes), the
dual twist can be read o from the minimal number of duplications required to go from 0
to any of the choices .

3 the case of su (2) (twisted) instantons

having presented the general formalism, let us now concentrate on the study of su(2)
gauge eld congurations for spatially symmetric tori. from the previous formulas one
can deduce that the symmetric structure of the torus is not always preserved by the nahm
transform. nonetheless, the dual torus is always contained within the symmetric torus
r4/. furthermore, if a given torus has ls/lt  1, its nahm transform corresponds to
ls/lt  1. thus, the nahm transform of the torus instanton congurations are the torus
caloron congurations. the space of gauge inequivalent solutions denes the moduli space.
its dimension is given through an index theorem to be 4nq for su(n) gauge elds of
charge q on the torus. note that qn = q n so that the dimensionality is preserved by the
nahm transform. indeed, in ref. [6] it is proven that the nahm transformation induces an
isometry between the moduli spaces.

3.1 the twisted instanton q = 1

2

we start with the smallest value of the topological charge, for su(2) this is q = 1
2 . the
dimension of the moduli space is 4, so that the set of solutions is discrete up to translations.
the value of the topological charge is related to the twist by the formula [2, 29]

q =  

~k  ~m

n

,

(11)

where  is an integer. fractional values of the topological charge are attainable for non-
orthogonal twists, i.e. ~k  ~m 6= 0 mod n. for su(2) we choose ~k = ~m = (0, 1, 0), with
~k ~m = 1. we deduce n0 = 4 and therefore the nahm transformation is again an su(2) self-
dual gauge eld with topological charge 1
2 . furthermore, it lives on a torus with generators
e() = 1
2 e(), where e() are the dual basis vectors e(0) = (1/lt, 0, 0, 0), e(1) = (0, 1/ls, 0, 0),
e(2) = (0, 0, 1/ls, 0), e(3) = (0, 0, 0, 1/ls). the corresponding twist is unchanged.

now we will explain how this works for congurations with ls/lt  1. this will serve
to illustrate the precision of our numerical techniques. one can generate self-dual congu-
rations numerically by employing the method described in ref. [3]. to minimise the errors
due to lattice artifacts we actually make use of the improved cooling technique described in

8

ref. [14], with the parameter  = 0. one can implement twist by the method of ref. [30].
we have generated self-dual congurations with the twist mentioned above on lattices of
size 4  163 and 32  83. notice that in the former case ls/lt = 4 and in the latter case
1
4. they correspond to nahm-dual tori for this twist. in both cases the action density of
the conguration has a lumpy prole with a single maximum in space. the position of the
maximum does not coincide with a lattice point, but can be estimated by interpolation.
then, given the interpolated position of the maximum, one can determine the coordinates
corresponding to each lattice point with respect to it.

what we did next was to apply the numerical nahm transformation introduced in
ref. [25]. the values of z, where the nahm transformation was calculated, were those
corresponding to the lattice points of the dual conguration. in this way the nahm trans-
formation can be compared with the lattice conguration obtained on the dual torus. fig. 2
shows the result of such a comparison for the action density along a line on the torus. the
agreement is remarkable. it shows the way in which our expectations work and gives us
condence on the precision of our numerical methods to investigate other more complicated
situations. note that in fact ref. [25] dealt with the case of four q = 1
2 instantons (with
ls/lt = 1) on a 12  6  12  6 lattice, nding that the conguration is mapped to itself

9

(up to a shift). in terms of the q = 1
2 twisted instantons this can be understood from the
fact that only its position is a free parameter. since the work in ref. [25] the numerical
methods have been greatly improved, details of which will be reported elsewhere.

3.2 temporal twist q = 1
let us recall what is known about q = 1 congurations with ~m = ~0 and ~k 6= ~0, for the
cases lt/ls  0 (torus calorons) and  (torus instantons). these will be mapped onto
each other by the nahm transformation and we are interested in establishing how the 8
dimensional moduli spaces are related.

the torus caloron congurations (lt  ls) have been studied recently by -cooling tech-
niques [24]. as lt/ls  0 these congurations approach some of the non-trivial holonomy
calorons [16, 17], namely those associated with  = 1

4 correspond to equal size constituent monopoles located at two
these calorons with  = 1
dierent points. for nite ls/lt the periodic boundary conditions in space slightly modify
the action density proles without changing the qualitative features. already for ls/lt = 4
the agreement is excellent [24].

on the right at y = t = 0) with  = 1
~y2 = (1.38, 0.24, 2.67), in units where  = lt = 1 (or a = 1
4 ) and the left most lattice point
corresponding to x = z = 0. the plots give the added densities of the two zero-modes.

recently also the weyl-dirac zero-mode for the innite volume caloron with non-trivial
holonomy was determined analytically [31]. the zero-modes are more localised than the ac-
tion density and the agreement between the numerically determined zero-mode for the torus
caloron is therefore expected to be even better. this is illustrated in fig. 3, where we com-
pare these exact innite volume zero-modes with those that are numerically constructed.

10

since the zero-modes are the ingredients for performing the nahm transformation, the
present comparison shows the numerical accuracy that was achieved. for convenience we
have taken for this comparison the parameters that were used in fig. 1 of ref. [24], where
one can nd the action density proles. in this particular case ~k = (1, 1, 1) and we dupli-
cate the initial torus in the time-direction, to reach a situation without twist. this gives
a charge 2 conguration with two zero-modes, of which one is periodic and the other is
anti-periodic. from ref. [31] one knows that each is localised on one of the constituents.
the numerical procedure was to combine the two zero-modes of the doubled lattice in two
orthonormal modes, each maximising the overlap with one of the two constituents. using
the large degree of localisation, we have simply added the zero-mode densities together
to show the result in one gure, but we stress each lump corresponds to the density of
one of the zero-modes. there are no free parameters involved in this comparison and the
agreement for the zero-modes is indeed impressive.

in the innite volume the parameters of the caloron are described by the spatial posi-
tions of the two constituents (6 parameters), one overall time position and a u(1) phase
rotation that can be undone by a gauge transformation. for large separations of the con-
stituents the caloron becomes static with the two constituent monopoles showing up as
separate lumps. on the other extreme when the constituent monopoles are close to each
other they fuse into a single lump that looks like an ordinary instanton in r4.

torus instanton congurations (ls  lt) were studied a few years ago [14, 15]. as
ls/lt  0 the congurations evolve into well-dened solutions on t 3  r. one feature
shared by all these torus instanton solutions is that they are local in time. at large times
the congurations have to approach a pure gauge, to guarantee the action stays nite. the
gauge elds with zero curvature on t 3 at t =  are characterised by their holonomies
(spatial polyakov loops)

when we consider lt/ls nite, the instanton has 8 parameters, but the holonomies can
not be rigorously dened. in the limit lt/ls   they would, however, be related by the
twist factors. it is likely that in this limit the three holonomies are part of the moduli
that describe the solution (for the innite volume caloron, gauge zero-modes associated
with a variation of  are not normalisable and  is not a moduli parameter). there are
indications that the holonomies x the scale of the torus instanton [15, 18]. in addition
there are of course the four position parameters, and presumably a phase that describes
the colour orientation relative to the twist matrices.

the dual gauge eld for instantons on t 3  r with temporal twist was shown to be
a solution of the abelian bogomolny equations with point sources [18] that have (due to
the self-duality) equal magnetic and electric charges. from this one computes the maxwell
eld analytically by summing over the periodic copies of these charges. essential is that
the location of the point charges is determined by the holonomies p 
j . at these specic
points on the dual torus the nahm transformation is modied due to boundary terms in the

11

non-compact directions. this leads to four singularities, whose locations are determined
by requiring exp(2iljzj)p 
to have a unit eigenvalue (this leads to a zero-energy state
j
in the weyl-dirac hamiltonian at t =  and therefore to non-exponential decay of the
zero-mode). the charges are all equal in absolute value, due to dirac quantisation [18],
and opposite in sign for those associated to the holonomies at either end. with temporal

twist, the location of the sources with one sign of the charge are displaced by 1

we illustrate in fig. 4 how the singularities arise as lt increases. the results are based
on a charge 1 instanton on an 20  83 and 40  83 lattice with temporal twist ~k = (1, 1, 1)
j = (0.86, 0.76, 0.082) (changing lt and making
and holonomies dened by 1
sure the holonomies stay xed can be achieved by cooling with open boundary conditions,
introduced in ref. [15]). we choose units such that ls = 1, so that the sources with positive
charge are located at ~z = (0.415, 0.387, 0.263) and ~z = (0.585, 0.613, 0.737) and the ones
with negative charge at ~z = (0.915, 0.887, 0.763) and ~z = (0.085, 0.113, 0.237). fig. 4 is
plotted in the plane dened by z3 = 0.263, which is through the position of the rst source
and still close to the position of the last source. shown is the ratio of the action density
for the 40  83 lattice over the action density for the 20  83 lattice.

the nature of the singularities is illuminated by the observation, made before, that
the nahm transformation of the torus instantons are the torus calorons. thus, the action
density peaks correspond to the location of the bps constituent monopoles. their mass
4) should be given by 82lt (in units where ls = 1). the result
(associated to w = 1
is compatible with the fact that the peak heights of these bps monopoles scale as l3
t .
away from the core of these bps monopoles the eld becomes abelian and should become
independent of lt, as the charge is xed. fig. 4 shows that indeed the ratio becomes one
outside of the core of the monopoles. the non-abelian core of the bps monopole shrinks
to a point in the limit lt  , and one is left with the resulting abelian eld. this is
illustrated in fig. 5, where we plot the square of the electric eld in the plane dened by

12

z3 = 0.5. the numerical result is based on the 40  83 lattice, for which the plane z3 = 0.5
is far enough away from all sources not to be aected by their non-abelian dressing as
su(2) bps monopoles of mass 402 (in units where ls = 1). the agreement, that involves
no free parameters, is indeed very good.

40  83 instanton conguration described in the caption of fig. 4. on the left is the
numerical result and on the right the analytic result for t 3  r.

the nahm transformation was constructed by doubling in time, such that at nite lt
this corresponds to a charge 2 torus instanton, which is mapped to a charge 2 torus caloron
][0, 1]3. our general formalism tells us that this is formed
dened on the hypercube [0, 1
by duplicating the nahm-dual torus, which is half the size. the latter corresponds to a
skew lattice, since the twist is not in the frobenius standard form. the additional lattice
generator is precisely the vector 1
) giving the displacement of the 2 positive
versus the 2 negative sources.

in summary, we have illustrated how the nahm transformation maps torus instantons
into torus calorons, and how the (approximate) holonomies are mapped into the positions
of the constituent bps monopoles. this relation is exact in the limit that lt   (resp.
0). to test its validity at nite lt/ls we studied the case with temporal twist ~k = (0, 1, 0)
( ~m = (0, 0, 0)). one cannot have both the original and nahm-dual torus to be spatially
symmetric, due to the asymmetric twist, but that is not important for the general con-
s,  = 0
clusion about the mapping we are studying. if our original torus has size lt  l3
has size 1

original ones.

by means of improved cooling ( = 0) we have generated a lattice torus caloron cong-
uration [24]. the relative distance between the two constituent monopoles can be tuned
by using dierent values of the parameter  [24]. on the other hand, it is possible to use
a modied version of cooling [15] (xing the eld to have zero colour magnetic elds at
t = 0 and t = lt in terms of prescribed holonomies) in order to produce torus instanton
congurations with xed holonomies.
if we choose these to be the ones determined by
the location of the monopole constituents of the torus caloron, then the numerical nahm
transformation [25] can be applied to each of these congurations and has to give back
the other conguration, up to a translation. this is illustrated in fig. 6. the somewhat

13

larger numerical dierences are in part due to the not suciently large ratio for lt/ls which,
for the required values of the holonomies, enforces a rather narrow instanton which is not
easily stabilised on the lattice. results for a smaller value of lt/ls (not shown) conrm this
improvement with increasing lt/ls. going to even a larger ratio is however computation-
ally too expensive. the comparison conrms that the holonomies of the time-twisted torus
instanton are part of the moduli.

3.3 spatial twist q = 1
we will conclude by discussing the case of spatial twist (~k = ~0), for which we take ~m =
(0, 1, 0). if our original torus has size lt  l3
s, the nahm dual torus for this twist has size
1
(to obtain instead a spatially symmetric dual torus we should apply
lt
the nahm transformation to a torus with size lt  1
2ls). as before, the dual
gauge eld has the same spatial twist as the original gauge eld. the phenomenology of
these congurations, for the large aspect ratios we are interested in, is dierent to the
previous case with temporal twist. but there are also quite interesting analogies that may
be important for the case lt = ls, where from the euclidean point of view there should be
no essential dierence between twist in space or time.

2 ls  ls  1

the analysis of ref. [24] shows that for ls/lt large, torus calorons with spatial twist
are given by congurations that approximate the innite volume caloron with arbitrary

14

holonomy, parametrised by   [0, 1
2], such that the two constituent monopoles have in
general diering masses, 162/lt and 82(1  2)/lt. but now their relative positions are
xed and determined by the spatial twist. this contrasts with the situation for temporal
twists for which the value of w is xed, but the relative position is arbitrary.

torus instantons with twisted boundary conditions in space, and ls/lt small, have been
studied extensively in relation to the hamiltonian formulation in a twisted box [21]. the
outcome of these studies [22] showed that the congurations can be described in terms of
two q = 1
2 twisted instantons (2q twisted instantons in the case of higher charges), that
have both twist in space and time. the net twist in time, however, vanishes. we can view
the q = 1
2 constituents of the q = 1 instanton in very much the same way as the monopole
constituents for the caloron. it was found that the space-time locations of these twisted
instanton lumps can be arbitrary. only when they are very close to each other, they merge
into a single lump. in that region, when the size of the lump becomes small compared to
ls, the conguration behaves like the ordinary instanton in r4. there are two very simple
specic examples where this constituent nature of the torus instantons with spatial twist
2 instanton with twist ~m = ~k = (0, 1, 0) and duplicate either in
is apparent. take a q = 1
the 0 or 2 direction to remove the time twist. the result is a q = 1 instanton with spatial
twist. either the two lumps have the same spatial positions and are separated maximally
along the time direction, or they have equal time positions and are maximally separated
along the space direction.

we now turn our attention to studying how the nahm transformation relates these
torus instantons and calorons. for the above example built from two q = 1
2 instantons,
this can directly be understood in terms of the results of section 3.1, where it was shown
2 instanton is a bps monopole, with twist ~k = ~m = (0, 1, 0).
that the dual of such a q = 1
duplication of the instanton in the 0 direction is dual to duplication of the bps monopole
4 )
in the 2 direction, and we do get a caloron with maximal separation of the ( = 1
constituents in the direction of the spatial twist. on the other hand, duplication of the
instanton in the 2 direction is dual to duplication of the bps monopole in the 0 direction.
this doubles the mass of the constituent monopole and corresponds to a caloron with
trivial holonomy  = 0 or 1
2 (the other constituent is massless and therefore absent). this
establishes that, with twist in space,  need not be 1
4 .

to deal with a more general case, we consider the q = 1 instanton with spatial twist
2 ( ~m = (0, 1, 0), ~k arbitrary such that ~k ~m = 1(mod 2)) with an
being made out of two q = 1
arbitrary time separation, i.e. no longer obtained by duplication in the time direction. to
study some of the properties of its nahm transform, we consider the limit ls  0. in this
limit all spatial dependence is removed and the two q = 1
2 instantons shrink to two points,
specied by their positions in time. in one dimension curvature can be non-trivial only
at point-like singularities, so the curvature vanishes everywhere, except at the locations
of the q = 1
2 instantons, where the eld strength becomes singular. the curvature free
regions are described by a constant abelian gauge eld aj, making a jump at the positions
2 instanton, the twist determines
of the q = 1
the jump in the constant gauge eld to be  aj = kj/ls (relevant for the case of space
twist, so as to assure that eq. (14) is satised. in the general case, where the values of the
polyakov loops are not xed (see below), there is more freedom). the q = 1 instanton is

2 instantons. in this limit, for a single q = 1

15

therefore described by

aj = 2(j + 1

,

2kj[ta,tb](t)/ls)

(15)
where j (and a0) are arbitrary constants (xed for spatial twist, see later) and [ta,tb](t)
is the characteristic function of the interval t  [ta, tb]. this result agrees exactly with
the nahm transformed gauge eld of the innite volume caloron [16]. we can identify
~k/ls(= a2) with the distance vector between the two constituents (in units set by
2(tb  ta) with its holonomy (see the second of ref. [16], eqs. (41) and
lt = 1) and  = 1
(65), for the precise denitions of  and a).

figure 7: comparison between the action densities of the numerical nahm transform of a
torus instanton and the appropriate innite volume analytic caloron solution. the original
eld lives on a 80  4  8  4 lattice with twist ~k = (0, 0, 0), ~m = (0, 1, 0). units are set
by lt = 1. the temporal distance between the two q = 1
2 constituents for the instanton
corresponds to a caloron with  = d0/2 = 0.311. the plot is along the line connecting the
centers of the two constituent monopoles, dened by z1 = z3 = 5 as determined by the
spatial holonomies of the instanton.

it may seem that for the nahm gauge eld of the caloron ta =  and tb =  are
xed, but one should of course realise that a is still self-dual, away from the singularities,
when t is shifted over a constant. we conclude that the holonomy of the caloron xes the
relative locations of the q = 1
2 instanton lumps under the nahm transformation, whereas
the holonomies of the instanton, determined in each of the two at regions (for ls  0), x
the relative locations of the constituent monopoles of the caloron. their dierence vector
2 ~m/ls, remarkably, agrees with maximal separation on the dual torus along the direction
determined by the spatial twist1. this derivation is as rigorous, in the limit ls  0, as the

one for t 3  [0, lt], in the limit lt   and has given a beautifully consistent picture of the
dual relationship between the moduli spaces of the calorons and nite volume instantons.
to test this picture at nite ls we have made use of our numerical methods. we started
with a conguration on an 80484 lattice containing two q = 1
2 torus twisted instantons
(with ~m = ~k = (0, 1, 0)) separated in time by a distance d0. in units where lt = 1 (so
ls = 1/10), the lattice  is generated by e0 = (1, 0, 0, 0), e1 = (0, ls/2, 0, 0), e2 = (0, 0, ls, 0)
and e3 = (0, 0, 0, ls/2). the dual torus r4/0 has as unit cell [0, 1]  [0, l1
s ]3. this
2 conguration
conguration is constructed in several steps. first one starts with a q = 1
on a 40  4  8  4 lattice with twist ~k = ~m = (0, 1, 0). using a time reversal and parity
2 instanton with the polyakov loops at t  
transformation one obtains a second q = 1
interchanged. one can glue the two congurations together at arbitrary time separation
if d0  ls this
d0 and transform them appropriately to trivial twist matrices in time.
procedure gives an approximate self-dual solution on the required torus and with spatial
twist. the small deviations from self-duality induced by the procedure can be eliminated
by cooling with  = 0. we end up with a q = 1 conguration with the desired properties.

figure 8: the same as in fig. 7, but for a temporal distance corresponding to d0 = 0.786.

a few remarks are in order, concerning the values of the polyakov loops for the space
twisted instantons. eqs. (12) and (13) are only valid in the gauge where the appropriate
a(x) are trivial. such a gauge was assumed for the discussion in sect. 3.2. the general
formula for a wilson loop that closes by the shift over a period reads [32]

p(x) = p exp(iz l

0

a(x)dx) e()(x)

.

(16)

in the presence of a space twist the pi are not arbitrary, but uniquely determined (up
to some discrete transformations) by the twist. this can be seen as follows. since the

17

2trp1 = 1

2

2trp3 = 0 and 1

conguration is exponentially localised in time, it goes to a pure gauge at . now one
can choose a gauge in which ai(t = ) = 0, xing i = 0 in eq. (15), for which the twist
matrices e(i) are constant and the holonomy is given precisely by these matrices. the fact
that e(1) and e(3) anticommute (as a result of the twist), implies they can be brought to
the form i1 and i3, respectively. on the other hand, the constant twist matrix for the 2
direction has to commute with these pauli matrices and therefore must be i. this xes
the polyakov loops for the q = 1 space twisted instanton at both t =  and t =  to
2trp2 = 1, depending on whether we choose the twist matrix
be 1
in direction 2 to be i. the location of the caloron constituents are determined by the
holonomies to be at ~z = (5, 0, 5), and the one displaced by 1
2 ~m/ls from it, i.e. ~z = (5, 5, 5).
we have generated two such congurations with time separations between the q = 1
instanton constituents given by d0 = 0.622 and d0 = 0.786. in figs. 7 and 8 we compare
the nahm transformed results with the innite volume analytic caloron solutions and the
holonomy xed to  = d0/2. plotted is the action density along the line joining the
two monopoles. the comparison is very good taking into account that there are no free
parameters. the mismatch at the peaks can be attributed to the fact that the data points
correspond to a nite ratio lt/ls = 1/10, which is zero for the analytic result. a direct
comparison with numerical data at this xed ratio is dicult due to its small value, and
seems unnecessary given the agreement shown in figs. 7-8.

4 conclusions

by now our knowledge of self-dual congurations on the torus has come from various
sources. apart from general existence proofs and consequences of the index theorem, in-
formation in this eld has arisen from both numerical studies based on lattice gauge theories
and analytical results obtained on manifolds having compact and non-compact directions.
most of the interest and information refers to self-dual congurations on spatially symmet-
ric tori of size lt l3
s for large and small aspect ratios, known as torus instantons (ls/lt  1)
and torus calorons (ls/lt  1). in this paper we have studied the nahm transformation
that relates su(n) self-dual gauge elds of charge q with twisted boundary conditions
on a torus, to su(n0q) self-dual gauge elds of charge n/n0 on the dual torus. here
n0 is determined by the twist. we found that torus calorons and instantons are dual to
each other. this provides information on their respective moduli spaces, which is fully
consistent with the structure suggested by numerical studies. in particular, it allows us
to understand the ndings of ref. [24]. the most notable result is the duality observed
between holonomies and the location of constituent structures (bps monopoles or twisted
instantons), as suggested by analysis of the nahm transformation of congurations living
in t 3  r and r3  s1. we showed how the abelian nahm connections with singularities
obtained in this case, result from the collapse of the non-abelian core of the constituents
into point-like singularities, which act as sources of the surviving abelian eld. thus, all
the information ts nicely into a unied picture.

our results might be of help in dierent respects. recently the (t ) dualities discussed
here have played important roles in d-brane and string compactications and our ndings
concerning the relation between holonomies and constituent positions is an interesting one
also in this context. for the low charges studied here we saw that the basic constituent is

18

a twisted instanton, with charge q = 1
2 in su(2), which shows up as a bps monopole at
nite temperature. we have shown that this fractional instanton maps onto itself under
the nahm duality transformation, a property guaranteed by the fact that for su(2) the
twist is preserved under the duality transformation and the only freedom is the position of
these twisted instantons. it would be interesting to see in which sense these constituents
do continue to play an important role at higher charges. finally, we hope that the work
presented here will lead to a more complete analytic understanding.

appendix

in this appendix we will provide the proofs of the basic ingredients of the avour construc-
tion of nahms transformation for non-trivial twisted boundary conditions (~k, ~m 6= ~0). in
particular, we will present in a basis independent way the derivation of the characterisation
for the nahm-dual torus and its corresponding dual twist. this complements the results
of ref. [26].

our starting point is the set of weyl zero-modes i

z (x) satisfying the boundary con-
ditions of eq. (9). consider now the behaviour of these zero-modes under translation of
the variables z. it is easy to see that given a solution z(x) of the weyl equation one can
construct a new solution of the weyl equation as follows:

z (x)  e2iy(x) z+y(x)
(y)

,

(17)

for any element y  r4 (as usual the space of linear forms r4 can be identied with r4, and
y(x)  y  x). applying this to an orthonormal set of solutions of the weyl equation one
obtains a new set. this set satises dierent boundary conditions, obtained from eq. (9)
by replacing the twist eating matrices (a),

(a)  (a) = e2iy(a) (a)

.

(18)

we thus see that there is a correspondence between translations in z and dierent choices
of twist-eating solutions.

in general the matrices (a) constitute an inequivalent set of solutions to the original
(a). however, for special values of y the two sets are unitarily equivalent (related by a
similarity transformation). for those values of y, denoted by a, there exist u(n0) matrices
(a) satisfying

(a) (a) = e2ia(a) (a) (a)

.

(19)

this formula shows a nice duality between both sets of u(n0) matrices. before investigating
for which a these equations have solutions, we want to discuss its consequences. for all
values a, for which eq. (19) has solutions, we can construct the functions

e2ia(a) j

z+a(x) ji(a)

(20)

which form a new orthonormal set of solutions of the weyl equation with the same boundary
conditions eq. (9). thus, they can be expressed as a unitary combination of the original
set of zero-modes. we arrive at the main formula:

i

z+a(x) = e2ia(a) 

ij(a) j

z (x)( 

a(z))

.

(21)

19

from this one can deduce that for all a the nahm transformed gauge eld satises

a(z + a) = [ a(z)] a(z)

(22)
one easily sees that the set of a dene a lattice , which we will call the nahm-dual lattice.
it is a sublattice of , the lattice dual to . we dene the nahm transformation of the
original self-dual gauge eld with twist as the restriction of a to the nahm-dual torus
r4/. this is a u(n0q) self-dual gauge eld with topological charge q = n0n/|/|,
where |/| stands for the number of unit cells of  that t in a unit cell of , or the
number of elements in (mod ). the matrices a(z) are the corresponding twist matrices.
now let us investigate the solutions to eq. (19) and the characterisation of . for that
it is essential to use some properties of the twist eating solutions. one can prove [1] that
the set of matrices (a) contains a set of n 2
0 linearly independent matrices, which form a
basis of the space of all n0 n0 matrices. actually, to construct this basis one has to select
a representative of the quotient lattice /0. its order is precisely n 2
0 . the sublattice 0
can also be dened as the one associated to the matrices (a) commuting with all other
(a) for any a  . we call it the center lattice. using this fact one can, after some eort,
prove that indeed the matrices (a) do coincide, up to a phase factor, with the original
matrices (a). in more mathematical terms, we can say that there exists a mapping 
from  to  such that

(a) = ei(a) ((a))

(23)
where (a) is an arbitrary phase. from this we can identify . let a be an element of 0,
then it commutes with all matrices (a) for any a  , this includes the matrices (a).
inspecting eq. (19) we conclude that a(a)  z for any a  0. therefore  = 0, the
nahm dual lattice coincides with the dual lattice of the center lattice. one can also see
that the center lattice of  coincides with . from here it is immediate to see that the
nahm-dual of the nahm-dual gives back the original lattice.

.

there is one extra ingredient which has to be worked out, namely what is the nahm

dual twist. this follows from eq. (23) and eq. (8). we have
(a) (a) = e2i n (a,a)) (a) (a)

(24)

with

(25)
eq. (21) is only consistent provided the nahm-dual twist matrices a(z) satisfy twisted
boundary conditions analogous to eq. (2) with the skew symmetric form n replaced by
n , the dual twist form.

n (a, a) = n ((a), (a))
