abstract

an abstract formulation of quantum dynamics in the presence of a
general set of quantum constraints is developed. our constructive pro-
cedure is such that the relevant projection operator onto the physical
hilbert space is obtained with a single, common integration procedure
over the original lagrange multiplier variables that is completely in-
dependent of the general nature of the constraints. in the associated
lattice-limit formulation it is demonstrated that expansion of the con-
straint operator contribution to second order in the lattice spacing is
necessary while, as usual, only a rst-order expansion is needed for the
dynamical operator contribution. among various possibilities, coher-
ent state path integrals are used to illustrate a completely functional
representation of the abstract quantization procedure.

1 introduction

the abstract operator formulation of quantum mechanics is generally recog-
nized as being the most fundamental, while those formulations that involve
one or another representation need to contend with representation-dependent
issues (e.g., lack of global coordinates) that have no place in the essential
formulation. our goal here is to study quantum dynamics and quantum con-
straints as much as possible in an abstract, representation-independent way.

1

only then should one feel comfortable about introducing a representation for
further analysis. let us start with some basics.

the evolution operator, from time t = 0 to time t = t > 0, for a general
quantum system with an abstract, self-adjoint, time-independent hamilto-
nian operator h, is given, in units where  = 1 (which are often used), by the
unitary operator eiht acting on an abstract hilbert space h known hence-
forth as the original hilbert space. if the hamiltonian is time dependent
and self adjoint for all t, 0  t  t , the evolution operator is instead given
by the unitary operator

t eir t

0

h(t) dt ,

where t denotes the time-ordering operator. we may append to h(t) a sum
of additional, time-independent, self-adjoint operators {}a
=1 with general,
real-valued, time-dependent coecients {(t)}a
=1 leading, by assumption,
for all t, 0  t  t , to the self-adjoint operator h(t) + (t), with sum-
mation implied (the generalization to a set of time-dependent, self-adjoint
operators {(t)}a
=1 is briey discussed later). taken as the generator of
time translations, the extended evolution operator reads

t eir t

0

[h(t)+(t)] dt .

if the functions {(t)}a
=1 are xed from the beginning and held xed, the
term (t) provides an addition to the hamiltonian and modies the dy-
namics in the expected way. if we regard the functions {(t)}a
=1 as variable
external sources, then functional derivatives with respect to them lead to pro-
totype expressions from which time-ordered correlation functions may be ob-
tained. alternatively, if the functions {(t)}a
=1 denote suitable stochastic
variables, then an expectation of the given expression may relate to systems
interacting with random potentials. besides these examples, let us consider
a rather dierent interpretation and application of the extra term (t),
which we now describe.

let us accept the hypothesis that the set {}a

=1 consists of constraint
operators, which, when appropriately satised, direct attention to a subspace
of h called the physical hilbert space and which is denoted by h phys. as a
closed subspace, it follows that h phys = e h for some unique projection oper-
ator e (= e  = e 2). in turn, the projection operator e should be given by
an acceptable function of the constraint operators {}a
=1, and it is the role

2

of an integration over the variables {(t)}a
=1 to build the necessary projec-
tion operator e . hereafter, we shall refer to the set of functions {(t)}a
=1
as the lagrange multiplier variables.
in simple cases it is easy to determine a suitable projection operator e
[1]. for example, if a = 1, and so there exists a single constraint, thensee
appendix awe observe, for any  = () > 0 ((n.b. () is not a dirac
delta function but a rather general function of )), that

z 



ei sin()



d = e (    ) = e (2  2) .

if  = 0 is part of a purely discrete spectrum near zero, then it is possible
to choose  > 0 such that e (2  2) = e ( = 0). when  = 0 is part
of the continuum, we choose 0 <   1; one procedure to take the limit
  0 to arrive at the true physical hilbert space h true phys is discussed
in appendix b. from this discussion, it follows in the continuum case that
we may regard h phys as a provisional physical hilbert space, which, despite
the qualifying adjective, is, for an extremely small , already acceptable for
calculational purposes. as a second example consider that the constraints are
the generators of a compact lie group, and let dm() denote the normalized

group invariant measure, r dm() = 1. in that case (e.g., [1, 2, 3])

z ei dm() = e ( = 0, 1    a) = e ( = 0) .

in order to generate the projection operator e , these examples illustrate
that dierent measures for the lagrange multiplier variables may be involved.
indeed, in order to construct e , even for a single set of constraints, it is
generally the case that the measure for the lagrange multiplier variables is
not unique.

the use of dierent measures for dierent situations is not wrong but
it does mean that some specic properties about the system, especially the
constraints, need to be determined before an expression for e can be found.
this is clearly a nuisance, and it raises the question whether there exists a
single, common, integration procedure by which we can construct e , and
which, moreover, is a procedure that is completely independent of the specic
constraints at hand. the answer to this question is yes!, and the aim of
the present paper is to develop a universal prescription for determining e

3

from a given set of constraint operators, whatever kind of constraints they
may be, by means of a prescription that is also independent of the specic
hamiltonian operator.

there are various kinds of constraints that need to be considered. in the
usual nomenclature (see, e.g., [4]), the constraints may be: rst class, closed
or open; anomalous or second class; primary or secondary; irreducible or
reducible; regular or irregular. in the reducible case, where the constraints
are linearly dependent, it is possible that there is an innite degeneracy when
a =  even if the number of degrees of freedom is nite; see below for an
example. regularity refers to whether the classical constraint is taken (say)
as q = 0 or as q3 = 0, etc., along with the quantum repercussions of this
kind of multiple choice test. implicitly, we assume that the hamiltonian and
the constraints satisfy some minimal consistency condition, in particular,
that the set of constraints already includes all the necessary constraints for
a given hamiltonian..

in what follows, all varieties of constraints will be dealt with in a uniform

fashion.

2 construction of the physical space

projection and evolution operators

we rst observe that the extended evolution operator may be written in the
form of a lattice limit given by

lim

(n1)

h(t) dtihteir n

(n1)

(t) dti ,

where   t /n and the directed product (symbol ) also respects the
time ordering. thus, this expression is simply an alternating sequence of
short-time evolutions, rst by (t), second by h(t), a pattern which
is then repeated n  1 more times. the validity of this trotter-product
form follows whenever h(t)2 +  is essentially self adjoint for all t,
0  t  t . as a slight generalization, we shall assume that h(t)2+m 
is essentially self adjoint for all t, 0  t  t . here the real, symmetric
coecients m  (= m ) are the elements of a positive-denite matrix, i.e.,
{m } > 0. for a nite number of constraints, a < , it is sucient

to assume that m  = ; other choices for m  may be relevant when

with all this in mind, we shall explain the construction of a formal inte-

and for which the integral represented by r   dr() is independent of the
set of operators {} and the hamiltonian operator h(t) for all t. we will
dene the left-hand side of this expression by means of an additional lattice
limit.

constructing the basic projection operator

for any given n, 1  n  n, let us divide the time interval ((n 1), n] into
n , n  < , steps of equal duration,   /n  = t /(nn ) > 0. in this way
we are led to consider the integrated directed product

for some measure dr(r(n,l)) to be determined. observe that in the indicated
expression the continuum variable t has been replaced by steps of size 
consecutively numbered by r(n, l)  (n  1)n  + (l  1) for 1  n  n and
1  l  n . as far as the previous integral goes, the particular value of n
is unimportant and we will suppress it for the rest of this discussion. thus
for the present we replace r(n, l) by l for simplicity. let us proceed in small
steps.

introduce a measure ds(l) for each l and an integral over  = {l}n 

l=1

relation functions (moments) given by r 

we choose ds(l) as a normalized probability measure with the rst two cor-
l ds(l) 
(2/) m ,  > 0, values that are independent of the time-slice label l.
with a minimal requirement on higher moments (such as nite fourth-order
moments), it follows that

l 
l ds(l)  0 and r 

j =



[[11   (m )]] + o()

y1ln 
= en  (m  ) + o() ,

where the last expression follows because the factors in the directed product
are now identical for every time slice l. at this point we may take the limit
n   ,   0 with n  =  held xed. stated formally, the net result is
that

z teir n

(n1)

(t) dt ds() = e(m  ) ,

independently of n, 1  n  n. note that many choices of the basic measure
ds(l) will lead to the same result. the mechanism which lies behind this
conclusion is similar to one leading to the central limit theorem in probability.
the next step in the process is to analytically extend the variable ,

   + i , where  > 0 still and  <  < , namely
e(m  )  e(+i )(m  ) ,

and after achieving this extension, the following step is to pass to the limit
  0+. both of these steps are achieved by the single integral operation

which achieves our goal. we occasionally symbolize the collective set of

operations by r   dr(), leaving the integrals over  and  implicit.

to summarize, let us assemble the several, separate operations together.

in particular, we observe that

where the proper denition of r   ds() has been given above. in accord
with the discussion in appendix a, we note that if the nal limit is replaced
by lim0, the result becomes e (m  < 2).

a few comments are in order. it is noteworthy that r dr() = 1. thus,
in the hypothetical case that all the constraint operators are bogus, i.e.,
  0 for all  (i.e., not simply weakly zero but strongly zero), it would
follow that

z 11 dr() = e (0  2)  11 .

if some, but not all, of the constraint operators are bogus, then, even though
an integration over the associated lagrange multiplier variables takes place,
the answer will be identical to one in which the lagrange multiplier variables
for the bogus constraint operators were ignored from the very beginning.
as another hypothetical case, assume that there is an innite number of
identical constraint operators, for example,    for all ,  = 1, 2, 3, . . . .
consequently, the extended evolution operator involves h(t) + (t) =
=1(t) . we clearly see that there is only one relevant lagrange
h(t) + 
multiplier variable, but to act on that knowledge would amount to choosing

7

an irreducible set of constraints from the original set. instead, let us keep
all the lagrange multiplier variables as independent quantities and proceed
along the lines developed in this paper. in this case let us choose, for example,
m   (6/22) . then it follows that the result of the integration with
respect to dr() yields the projection operator

e (m   2) = e ((

=1 (6/22) 2  2)) = e (2  2) ,

as desired. this is an (extreme) example of how the present procedure deals
with a reducible set of constraints without needing to extract an irreducible
subset. for more complicated examples it may be useful to experiment with
dierent choices of m .

the full-time physical evolution operator

up to this point we have determined how to construct the desired projection
operator e for any (nonzero) short-time interval  = t /n. let us assume
that we have carried out the necessary lagrange multiplier variable inte-
grations for every time slice, i.e., all n, 1  n  n. the result will be
the evolution operator restricted to the physical hilbert spacelet us call it
e(t )which is given by
teir n

e    e eir 

e(t )  lim

0

h(t) dt e .

0

h(t) dt

(n 1)

h(t) dt

(n 2)

the indicated limit can be taken with the result that

e(t ) = t e eir t

0

(e h(t)e) dt e = e [t eir t

0

(e h(t)e) dt ] e .

this result holds whether or not the eective hamiltonian he (t)  eh(t)e
at time t is (essentially) self adjoint or merely symmetric (hermitian) on
h phys. if it is not self adjoint, the resulting evolution will not be unitary. on
the other hand, there are many cases of interest when eh(t)e will be self
adjoint for all t, 0  t  t , and the evolution on the physical hilbert space
will be by unitary operators e(t) acting on h phys, and which, in fact, act
as the zero operator on the hilbert space h 
phys = h  h phys, namely, the
subspace othogonal to h phys, which may be called the unphysical hilbert
space h unphys = h 
phys  0. for con-
venience, we will assume that the eective hamiltonian is self adjoint and

phys. this follows from the fact that e h 

8

therefore that the resultant evolution is unitary. ((note, even when the eec-
tive hamiltonian is not self adjoint, that fact alone does not imply that the
resultant evolution takes physical vectors into unphysical vectors; whatever
the form of evolution, vectors that start in the physical hilbert space will
remain in the physical hilbert space.))

constructive approach

it is very instructive to see the lattice-limit construction for the evolution
operator combined with the constraint operators in as direct a form as pos-
sible. for this purpose we assume that h(t) is a continuous function of t. in
that case, and modulo domain considerations, we assert that

here the single index n on the variables  and  labels consecutive time steps
with a spacing . observe that only the rst-order term (i.e., proportional
to ) is necessary to include for the hamiltonian, but to properly include
the constraints it is necessary to include rst- and second-order terms (i.e.,
proportional to  and  2). this dierence between the dynamics and the
constraints holds because the integration over the lagrange multiplier vari-
ables is, in reality, an integral over a (regulated) -correlated distribution.

this formula may also be brought to yet another interesting form. by
carrying out the integrations over all r(n,l) and n we are left with the ex-

special case

a great deal of simplication takes place whenever h(t)e = eh(t) for all t,
0  t  t . in this case we have the identity

e [t eir t

0

h(t) dt ] e .

(e h(t)e) dt ] e = [t eir t

observe that the evolution is then automatically unitary in the physical
hilbert space, and that it is only necessary to impose the projection operator
e once, say, as we have done, at the beginning of the evolution, very much in
the manner of an initial-value equation used in the case of classical rst-class
constraints.

remark

we hasten to add that for a given, specic set of constraints it is generally
possible to construct e by alternative and possibly simpler integral represen-
tations. by all means, when simpler procedures exist they should be used.
for example, as noted earlier in the case of a set of constraint operators which
close to form a lie algebra for a compact group, a group invariant average
over all unitary transformations continuously connected to the identity and
generated by the constraint operators leads to the same projection operator
e given by the general prescription developed in this paper for suciently
small ,  > 0.

relation with diracs prescription

the machinery developed above is expressed entirely in an abstract operator
form plus a functional integral over the lagrange multiplier variables which
has a well-dened formulation as a lattice limit. another abstract approach,
and one of the more common methods for dealing with constraints in the
presence of dynamics, is that proposed by dirac [5]. briey summarized,
diracs procedure denes the physical hilbert space as the subspace spanned
by vectors |i phys that fulll the requirement
 |i phys = 0

10

for all , implying an exact fulllment of the quantum constraints. for
second-class constraints, such as 1 = p and 2 = q, where p and q
are conventional heisenberg variables, there is no nontrivial solution of the
equations p|?i = q|?i = 0 for that would require [q, p ]|?i = i|?i = 0.
moreover, for a constraint  with zero in its continuous spectrum, the equa-
tion |#i = 0 has no (normalizable) solution in the hilbert space, i.e., there
is no nontrivial solution for |#i. thus, for second-class constraints, and for
general, open rst-class constraints, as well as for constraints with zero in the
continuum, the basic dirac prescription is unsatisfactory. of course, there
are modications of the dirac scheme, such as the use of a dirac bracket
[5] in the classical theory followed by the adoption of this bracket in the
process of canonical quantization. unfortunately, the classical phase space
associated with the dirac bracket generally has a nontrivial curvature (and
possibly a nontrivial topology), and so a straightforward application of the
quantization rules generally leads to an incorrect answer.

nevertheless, there are some elements of the dirac procedure and the
procedure developed in the present paper that are rather close to each other,
at least in spirit. for one thing, we note that if |?i = 0 for all , then
()|?i = 0 and conversely, where summation is implied and we are
only considering the case m  =  for simplicity. for the second-class
constraints considered above we would be asking that (p 2 + q2)|?i = 0,
which, as is well known, implies that |?i  0, an unsatisfactory solution.
let us relax this condition (cf., [6]) and say that (p 2 + q2)|?i =  |?i, for
which we do have a nonvanishing solution, namely |?i = |0i, the ground
state of the harmonic oscillator. there is no violation of the classical limit
for these constraints by this modication since, as   0, we recover the
original, classical, second-class constraints, namely, p = 0 and q = 0, in a
standard notation. however, the generalization of the dirac procedure just
illustrated suers from one important defect: the extended criterion does
not satisfactorily specify the physical hilbert space. take the given example
and instead let (p 2 + q2)|?i = c|?i for some constant c.
if c = 3 there
is a solution which is |?i = |1i, the rst excited state, but for c = 2or
indeed for any c, 1 < c < 3there is no nontrivial solution and so |?i = 0,
even though for any of these cases the recovery of the classical second-class
constraints still applies.

rather than relax the original dirac prescription in the manner just dis-
cused, we have chosen to look for solutions to the equation e (( 

11

2()))|?i = |?i. it is convenient to examine this expression as a function of .
for suciently large , there is generally a nontrivial subspace of vectors sat-
isfying this relation. as  decreases, the space in question remains the same
or its span may decrease. as an example, again take the second-class case
and consider e (p 2 + q2  c)|?i = |?i. beginning with small c, we observe
for c < 1 that there is no nontrivial solution, |?i = 0; for 1  c < 3, there is
a single nontrivial solution, |?i = |0i, which spans a one-dimensional hilbert
space; while for 3  c < 5, there is a two-dimensional hilbert space spanned
by the two vectors |0i and |1i, where the latter vector is the rst excited
state of the harmonic oscillator; etc. this dependence on the parameter c is
to be preferred to that described above.

suppose the second-class constraints are irregular as well. in particular,
let 1 = p and 2 = q3. we are then led to consider e (p 2 + q6 
c3/2). let c = c
0 denote the value that captures the ground state of
the hamiltonian p 2 + q6, let c = c
1 denote the value that captures the
rst excited state, etc. the argument then proceeds as above. of course,
e (p 2 + q6  c3/2) 6= e (p 2 + q2  c), for general c and c, but this
fact merely represents the ever-present o() ambiguity in any quantization
procedure.

time-dependent constraints

in the time-dependent case   (t), for all  and t, 0  t  t , and
assuming each constraint operator is continuous in t as well as the needed
self-adjoint properties, we are quickly led to an expression for the evolution
operator in the time-dependent physical hilbert space, given by

e (t )

12

while this expression is correct, there does not seem to be any simpler and
more elegant operator expression that holds in the general case of time-
dependent constraints.

we do not pursue time-dependent constraints further, and hereafter we

again assume that all the constraints have no explicit time dependence.

3 functional integral representation

it is convenient to adopt a functional representation for the original hilbert
space h, and to present the main properties of the foregoing argument in
that language. for this purpose, let us focus on a canonical system with
dim(h) =  and j degrees of freedom, j < , described by the basic,
irreducible, self-adjoint operators p = {p j}and q = {qj}, 1  j  j, which
satisfy the canonical commutation relations [qj, p k] = ijk11 with all other
commutation relations vanishing. as an irreducible set of operators, all other
operators may be constructed from the basic ones. hence, h(t) = h(p, q, t)
and  = (p, q) for some suitable functions.
although other bases may be used, we concentrate here on the functional
representation induced by coherent states. thus, along with the canonical
operators, we introduce canonical coherent states dened [7] by

|p, qi  eiqp eipq |i ,

where p = {pj}j
number, qp = j
moreover, for any choice of |i it follows [8] that

j=1, with each pj and qj an arbitrary real
j=1 and q = {qj}j
j=1 qjp j, etc., and |i is a xed, normalized ducial vector.

z |p, qihp, q| d(p, q) = 11 ,

d(p, q) = j

j=1 dpj dqj/2 .

needed domain restrictions on |i will be assumed, without comment, as
they arise. at this point p and q, although having suggestive names, are
just mathematical labels of the coherent states. as a rst step in giving
meaning to p and q, we assume that |i is physically centered, meaning
that h|p|i = 0 and h|q|i = 0. in this case it follows that hp, q|p|p, qi = p
and hp, q|q|p, qi = q. as a second step, we assume that |i is physically
scaled, i.e., that h|p 2|i = o(a) and h|q2|i = o(b), where a > 0,
b > 0, and a + b = 2.

13

in this expression we have again used r(n, l)  (n  1)n  + (l  1) and
identied (p, q) = (pn n , qn n ) and (p, q) = (p0, q0). we reemphasize that
it is necessary to expand the constraint operators to second order in the
lattice spacing in order to correctly obtain the desired projection operator.
it is customary to interchange the order of integration and the continuum
limit in order to arrive at a formal expression for the propagator in the
presence of the constraints.
in so doing one adopts for the integrand the
expression it would assume for continuous and dierential paths (even if
such paths do not contribute in the continuum limit!). in so doing one is
led to identify the classical action for which such paths are appropriate. if
we proceed in the same fashion, we arrive at the formal functional integral
expression

mz eir t

0

[p qh(p,q,t)a(t)(p,q)] dt dp dq dr() .

in this expression we have introduced the symbols

h(p, q, t)  hp, q|h(p, q, t)|p, qi ,
(p, q)  hp, q|(p, q)|p, qi .

we further note that h(p, q, t) = h(p, q, t) + o(c), c > 0, and (p, q) =
(p, q) + o(d), d > 0, thus leading to the expected behavior as   0.
it is clear from this expression that the system we have quantized here is
determined by the ( augmented) classical action functional

r t
0 [p q  h(p, q, t)  (t) (p, q)] dt ,

14

which has the expected form of a canonical system in the presence of a
number of constraints. evoking a stationary action principle for this classical
action leads to both dynamical and constraint equations as usual. note
that the second-order terms in the constraint operators needed in the lattice
formulation to construct the correct quantum projection operator disappear
in this formal expression since, for paths and lagrange multiplier variables
that are smooth and dierentiable, i.e., have classical behavior, these second-
order terms formally disappear.

while the derived classical action essentially reects the original quantum
theory, it is necessary, as always, to exercise great care in elevating a formal
path integral involving the classical action to a valid calculational procedure.
while not every lattice-limit formulation will lead to the correct answer, we
emphasize that one acceptable construction procedure is the one presented
in this paper.

commentary

in a classical theory, such as the one above, it is true that the lagrange multi-
plier variables play a signicant role in the solution of the classical equations
of motion, either being xed functions chosen to enforce the constraints in the
case of second-class constraints, or needing some arbitrary specication (se-
lection of a gauge) when the lagrange multiplier variables are not determined
by the equations of motion in the case of rst-class constraints. however,
what holds true in the classical theory has no reason to hold true in the
completely dierent quantum theory. for example, it should be noted that
nowhere in our discussion have we used the words gauge or gauge xing
in achieving the proper quantum results. indeed, in the abstract formulation
of section 2, the concepts of gauge and gauge xing are completely for-
eign to the whole procedure. if anything, gauge xing, and its associated
diculties, is a classical concept inappropriately and unnecessarily carried
over into the quantum theory. in concrete terms, and with respect to the
formal phase space path integral we have derived, we note that no discussion
of gauge invariance of the formal path integral has been given nor is any
needed.

if the constraints are all rst class and closed, then gauge invariance of
the resulting theory as expressed in the (true) physical hilbert space may
be demonstrated [1]. on the one hand, if  > 0 is chosen suciently small

15

so that e (m   2)  e (m  = 0) 6= 0, then invariance of
the resulting theory in the physical hilbert space follows from the fact that
ei e = e for arbitrary real-valued {}a
=1. on the other hand, if
e (m   2) 6= e (m  = 0) no matter how small  > 0 is,
then it means that ei e = e + o( e ), and gauge invariance arises
in the true physical hilbert space h true phys only after a suitable   0
limit as illustrated in appendix b. of course, for second-class constraints
the issue of gauge invariance does not arise. the presence of such constraints
is distinguished by the fact that e  0 for all  <  for some  > 0.
additionally, we observe that the abstract operator formalism developed
in section 2 applies to a eld theory just as well as to general systems of
nitely many degrees of freedom, canonical or otherwise. to discuss any
systema model eld theory includedone only needs to have candidate
operators for the hamiltonian and for the various constraints expressed in
the original hilbert space.

the construction of the rst projection operator example in section 1 relies
on a conditionally convergent integral, dened for  < x < , which is
given by

we may assign one meaning to this expression by choosing the formula

an expression which denes the function

= 0 if |x| >  .

it is clear that f 1

clearly in this case f1(x)2  f1(x) for all x. likewise we can also dene

f0(x) = 1 if |x| <  ,
= 0 if |x|   ,

which also satises f0(x)2  f0(x) for all x, by replacing lim0+ by lim0
in the denition of f1(x).
in application to a single, self-adjoint quantum constraint , we conclude,

for any  > 0, that

in many cases the resulting projection operators are identical. an example
for which they are not identical is given by

|0ih0|  e (p 2 + q2  ) 6= e (p 2 + q2 < )  0 .

here the one-dimensional projection operator |0ih0| projects onto the ground
state for a harmonic oscillator hamiltonian p 2 + q2.

appendix b

the issue of dealing with constraint operators with their zero in the contin-
uous spectrum has been dealt with by several authors [9]. here we oer a
brief discussion in keeping with the style of the present paper.

let us focus on the projection operator e (x 2  2) where x = 0 lies in
the continuous spectrum of the self-adjoint operator x dened in the original
hilbert space h. we write h = h1  h2 such that, for suciently small ,
x = x1  112, where x1 is nondegenerate while h2 accounts for possible
degeneracy. generally, this factorization depends on , but we assume that
a suitable limit of these spaces exists as   0. in the same decomposition,
e = e 1  112. for product vectors |i = |1i  |2i  h, it follows that

h|e (x 2  2)|i = h1|e 1(x 2

1  2)|1ih2|2i
dh1|e1(x)|1i h2|2i ,

= z 



where e1(x) is the spectral family for x1. for the rst factor we choose a
functional representation that diagonalizes x1 leading to

z 



1(x)1(x) dx .

18

for every |1i and |1i, this expression vanishes as   0. however, before
taking the limit let us rst rescale this integral so that it reads

1

2 z 



1(x)1(x) dx .

this expression has a well-dened and generally nonvanishing limit for a sub-
set of elements 1(x) and 1(x), namely, those that are continuous functions
in an open set about x = 0. for the subset of continuous functions, it follows
that

1

2 z 



lim
0

1(x)1(x) dx = 1(0)1(0) .

to summarize, we determine, for suitable elements |1i and |1i, that

lim
0

(2)1h|e (x 2  2)|i = 1(0)1(0)h2|2i .

if this expression is regarded as an incomplete inner product, then, after
completion, we learn that the resultant space is c  h2  h2 since c, the
space of complex numbers, has only one (complex) dimension. we conclude
that h true phys = h2.

we can understand this result in more physical terms. let us realize
h1 as l2([, ]) and introduce an orthonormal basis given by un(x) =
(1/2) einx/, n  {0,1,2, . . .}. if the hamiltonian contained the term
p 2
x = 2/x2, or such a term was added to the hamiltonian, then

p 2
x un(x) = (n/)2 un(x)

since un is an eigenfunction of p 2
x . for very small , all energy contributions
are huge save for the single case n = 0 when this contribution vanishes.

thus, when   1 energetics favor only the ground state u0(x) = 1/2 in

an expansion of 1(x) and 1(x), and consequently

1(x)1(x) dx = lim

for functions which are continuous about x = 0.

is it really necessary to take the limit   0? in our view the practical
answer is no. for example, if energies are restricted to those which are
much less than 2, a number which can be chosen as large as one likes, then
only the ground-state contribution arises for h1 and hence h true phys = h phys,
as desired.
