abstract

we study the topologically twisted string theory on the general back-ground ads3
n which is compatible with the world-sheet n = 2 superconformal symmetry and is
extensively discussed in the recent works [20]. after summarizing the algebraic structure

of the world-sheet topological theory, we show that the space-time (boundary) conformal

theory should be also topological. we directly construct the space-time topological

conformal algebra (twisted n = 2 superconformal algebra) from the degrees of freedom

in the world-sheet topological theory. firstly, we work on the world-sheet of the string

propagating near boundary, in which we can safely make use of the wakimoto free eld

representation. secondly, we present a more rigid formulation of space-time topological

conformal algebra which is still valid far from the boundary along the line of [11]. we also

discuss about the relation between this space-time topological theory and the twisted

version of the space-time n = 2 superconformal eld theory given in [20].

1 introduction

string theory on ads  n back-ground has been getting great importance in the studies
of ads/cf t -duality [1, 2, 3, 4]. among them, studies of string theory on ads3 back-ground

have old histories [5, 6], in which the several consistencies as the rst quantized string theory

have been intensively discussed from the points of view of string propagating on a non-compact

curved back-ground. more recently, a study emphasizing the relationship between the world-

sheet picture of string theory and the description of boundary conformal eld theory (cft)

on the ads3-target [7, 8] was initiated by giveon-kutasov-seiberg [9], and many subsequent

works which rene or extend it were carried out [10]-[23]. in particular the roles played by

the short string sectors, which were lacking in [9], were investigated in [10, 11].

these approaches from the world-sheet picture of perturbative string have opened up a

new perspective to the studies of ads3/cf t2-duality. namely, we can consider quite general
back-ground ads3n , which may not correspond to any brane conguration, as a consistent
string vacuum. although such a back-ground is outside of original idea of maldacena [1], which

is based on brane theory, we can still expect the existence of good holographic correspondence

with some boundary cft, because the asymptotic isometries of ads3 considered by brown-

hennaux [7] should correspond to innite numbers of conserved charges in perturvative string

theory.

in fact, in the framework given in the recent works [20] (and their related works

[24]), we must generally assign a fractional value to the level of sl(2; r) wzw describing

the ads3-sector, which corresponds to the brane charge in the usual setting of ns1/ns5.

in this paper we study the topological string on ads3  n with the suitable ns b-eld,
whose world-sheet fermions have integral spins. although we again have no origin based on

brane theory, it is natural to expect that there exists some space-time (boundary) cft which

is dual to the world-sheet theory of topological string, because of the same reason as above.

we show this space-time cft should be also topological, and the main result of this paper

is the construction of space-time topological conformal algebra from the world-sheet point

of view. there are two non-trivial points in this construction: the rst is the dierence of

brst charges between the topological string theory and the usual fermionic string theory.

the second point is as follows: in the standard rns formalism of fermionic string theory, the

space-time susy is realized by the spin elds, and so they are expected to compose a part of

the space-time superconformal algebra. however, in the case of topological string, we cannot

1

consistently consider the spin elds, since there do not exist the concepts such as ns and r

sectors. this fact seems to make it dicult to construct the space-time topological conformal

algebra in the analogus form as that for the untwisted string theory.

in order to construct the space-time conformal algebra we rst consider the near boundary

approximation, in which we can use the wakimoto free eld realizations of ane sl(2; r)

current algebra [25]. we propose the several conditions which should be satised by the cor-

rect space-time conformal algebra, and they lead us to a unique answer. nextly, we work

on a general string world-sheet propagating far from the boundary according to the formal-

ism developed in [11]. we present a candidate for the space-time algebra in this framework.

although it has rather complicated form, we can prove without using the free eld approxi-

mations that it indeed generates the correct topological conformal algebra, and it reduces to

the previous result by the wakimoto representation, when taking the near boundary limit.

2 topological twisting of fermionic string on ads3n

as was discussed in [20], the world-sheet superconformal symmetry of the fermionic string
theory on ads3  n enhances to n = 2, if n has an ane u(1)-symmetry and n /u(1)
denes an n = 2 superconformal eld theory (scft) on world-sheet.

to x the notations, let us rst present the eld contents in this fermionic string theory.

for more detailed arguments, see [20].

this sector has an ane sl(2, r)k symmetry j a = ja

the free fermions in the adjoint representation.

we already assumed the n /u(1) sector has n = 2 superconformal symmetry. we can
describe the sl(2; r)/u(1) sector by the kazama-suzuki coset cft [28], which is essentially
realized by the conformal elds {j+, j, +, } (j  j1  ij2,   1  i2), and the
u(1)2 sector is described by the standard coulomb gas representation of n = 2 scf t ,
whose members are two bosonic u(1) currents {j 3, k} and two fermions {3, }.
convenient for our later discussions to combine these bosonic currents and dene the bosonic
scalars  as follows;

it is a famous fact that we can construct a topological conformal eld theory (t cf t2)

from an arbitrary n = 2 scf t2 by the procedure of topological twisting [26, 27]. roughly

speaking, topological twisting means to shift the spins of the fermionic coordinates, namely,

to replace the physical fermion system with spin 1/2 with the ghost system with spin (0, 1).

usually topological twisting is dened with respect to the u(1)r-current jr in n = 2 super-
conformal algebra (sca) {t n =2, g

this topological theory can be naturally decomposed to the three independent sectors men-

each of them is described by the topological conformal algebra (tca): {t, g, j}, which
is dened as the twisted n = 2 superconformal algebra and our convention for this algebra

is presented in appendix a. the generators belonging to the dierent sectors (anti-)commute

with one another. this is an analogus structure as that for the topologically twisted gauged

wzw model [29]. we summarize this aspect as follows;

we must also consider the ghost system associated with the gauge xing of dieomorphism.
in the fermionic string theory before twisting, we have the spin (2,1) bc-ghosts and the spin
(3/2,1/2) -ghosts, which yield an n = 1 scf t2 with c = 15 that cancels the central
charge of matter sector. on the contrary, because the matter sector in the topological string

theory has already c = 0, the ghost sector should become a c = 0 cft, too. this leads us
to the system of fermionic ghosts with spin (2,1) and bosonic ghosts also with spin (2,1).
it is no other than the topological gravity sector [30], which also has a sturcture of twisted
n = 2 with c = 3. through this paper we shall use the symbols ,  for the wakimoto free
elds, and describe the topological gravity sector by the standard bosonizations [31] to avoid
confusion, that is, we set b = ei, c = ei,  = e,  = e, where (, ) is a spin (0,1)
fermionic elds, and ,  are scalar elds with the back-ground charges2q = 3i, q = 3,
which have the opes; (z)(0)   log z, (z)(0)   log z. it is also convenient to dene

according to the generalities of tcft. as is well-known, there are natural two choices for the
chiralities of qs (topological a-model or topological b-model). however, the detailed
discussions for this subject is beyond the scope of this paper. we shall only focus on the

left (or right) mover in the following discussions, and consider the physical condition (2.24)

simply as

qs|physi = 0,

|physi  |physi + qs|anyi.

(2.24)

the physical states correspond to the chiral primary states in the untwisted n = 2 theory on

world-sheet. moreover, since

2

k0(cid:18) i (j3 + 11 + k)(cid:19) = (cid:26) qs, ki 2(cid:27)

(2.25)

holds, arbitrary physical states must satisfy


0 +s k
j 3

2

k0
|physi = 0

(mod brst),

(2.26)

which is no other than the bps condition in space-time. it implies that the physical states

are also in one-to-one correspondence to the 1/2 bps states, or the chiral primary states in

the space-time theory derived from the untwisted world-sheet theory.

from this observation we can immediately conclude that the space-time cft associated

to our topological string must be also topological. in fact, since we now work on the ads3
back-ground, it is natural to expect that the qs-invariant virasoro operators {ln}nz of
brown-hennaux exist, and if so, they must satisfy

[j 3
0 , ln] = nln,

[k0, ln] = 0,

(2.27)

because of the requirement of sl(2; r)-symmetry on ads3. however, this means that
ln|physi cannot satisfy the condition (2.26) for any physical state |physi, unless all of the
{ln} are brst-exact. in this way, we have found that topological string on ads3 back-ground
should lead to the space-time conformal symmetry with the virasoro operators having the

brst-exact forms, namely, a topological conformal eld theory.

at this stage a few natural questions may arise; does this space-time tcft have a twisted

n = 2 algebra describing its local symmetry in the same way as the familar models of tcft

in two dimension? moreover, if it exists, can we regard it as the twisted version of the

space-time n = 2 algebra constructed in [20]?

8

the answer for the rst question is yes. in the next section we will construct the suitable

space-time conformal algebra from the world-sheet eld contents. at rst glance, the answer
for the second question seems also yes, because the most natural choice of l0-operator is as
follows (up to normalizaiton, of course);

l0 = 
0 +s k
j 3

2

k0
 ,

(2.28)

which is a brst-exact operator as seen above. this is indeed the l0-operator in the twisted
version of space-time n = 2 theory in [20], since ln =2
0 , and the u(1)r charge operator
= 2kk0. however, this is not the whole story. we must also care about the detailed
is j n =2
structure of higher virasoro generators to obtain this answer completely. in the next section

0 = j 3

0

we will discuss this point.

3 topological conformal symmetry in space-time

as we already demonstrated, the space-time conformal theory for the topologically twisted

string should also become topological. in this section we construct the tca in space-time.

we rst work in the near boundary region, where the string coordinates on ads3 become free

elds, and next present the more rigid framework that is still valid far from the boundary.

3.1 space-time topological conformal algebra in the near bound-

ary approximation

first of all, let us remember the (bosonic) ads3 sector is described in quantum level by the

following lagrangian [9];

l =   s 2

k

r(2) +   +     exp

k

where r(2) means the curvature on world-sheet. as was claried in [10], in the near boundary

region (  +), since the interaction term    exp

s 2

k

9

(3.1)


 ,

s 2

 is suppressed, we can safely

make use of the wakimoto free eld representations [25] for the ads3-sector. the (bosonic)

sl(2; r)-current can be realized as follows;

j3 =  +s k

2



j = 
j+ = 2 + 2k + (k + 2)




(3.2)

, (z)(0)   log z in our convention. the stress tensor in this sector is

t (z) = 

1
2

()2 

1
2k

2 + .

(3.3)

where (z)(0) 
given by

1
z

it is important to notice that the interaction term    exp

s 2

k


 is so-called screen-

ing charge, which does not break at least perturbatively the conformal invariance as well as

the ane sl(2; r) symmetry on the world-sheet. this implies that the results given in the
previous section are still valid in a generic region with   nite, in which the wakimoto rep.
is not reliable. in fact, we did not need the explicit realizations of sl(2; r)-currents for the

discussions in the previous section.

however, since the wakimoto rep. is very powerful for the purpose in this section, which

is to construct the suitable space-time conformal algebra, we shall rst work in the near
boundary region   +. in the next subsection we will consider the general region according
to the framework developed in [11].

the goal in this subsection is to construct the full space-time conformal algebra from the

degrees of freedom in the world-sheet topological theory in the analogous form as that given

in [9]. the rst guess for the answer may be the twisted version of the space-time n = 2

sca for the untwisted string [20] as mentioned in the previous section. namely, one might

suppose that

ln = ln =2

n 

1
2

(n + 1)j n =2

n

,

(3.4)

where ln =2
although this expectation seems to be natural, it is not correct. this is because the r.h.s of

are the stress tensor and the u(1)r current given in [20]. unfortunately,

, j n =2

n

n

(3.4) is not brst-invariant in the sense of topological string theory (except n = 0). further-

more we have another serious diculty: in the untwisted theory the space-time supercurrents

are made up of the spin elds. but, in the topological string theory, we have only the fermionic

10

elds with integral spins (ghost system) on world-sheet, and hence only the periodic bound-

ary condition is allowed. in this case we cannot consider the spin elds, which intertwine the

ns-sector with the r-sector in the usual fermionic string theory. therefore we must look for

the candidates of space-time conformal currents only within the ordinary vertex operators

(which has no pieces of the spin elds).

we here assume the conditions which the space-time conformal algebra {g

n , ln, jn} in

our topological model should satisfy;

1. they should generate a topological conformal algebra (twisted n = 2 superconformal
algebra). especially, {ln} generates the virasoro algebra with zero central charge
(irrespective of the value of i 1d).

2. {ln} act on the (bosonic) boundary coordinates as suitable local conformal transfor-

mations in the same way as those given in [9].

0 = qs  i (g+

n } should be qs-invariant.

3. {ln} and {g+
4. g+
5. all of the generators can be written in the form; an = i dz an(z), where an(z) is a spin

1 primary eld on the world-sheet, that is, it is a spin 1 current with no back-ground

tot + g+

t g) holds (up to normalization).

charge on the world-sheet;

t top(z)an(w)  0 

1

(z  w)3 +    .

the rst and second conditions are quite natural. but there is one important remark; we

require the rst condition is satised strictly, that is, not only up to qs-exact terms. oth-

erwise, we cannot determine the space-time conformal algebra at all, because the virasoro

generators themselves are now qs-exact and hence the algebra becomes trivial identities in

the sense of up to qs-exact terms.

one might ask about the third condition: why do not we impose the qs-invariance on
g and j , too? however, it is not peculiar in topological conformal eld theory. usually,
{qs, g} is not zero, rather equal to the stress tensor, and the ghost number current
j does not also commute with qs. as was already demonstrated, the assumption of the
qs-invariance of ln inevitably leads to the qs-exactness of it. this implies the topological
invariance in the space-time theory.

11

the fourth condition means that the brst-charge in the space-time topological theory

is equal to the one for the world-sheet theory. this assumption might be too strong. but,

from the viewpoint of ads/cf t -duality, all of the physical observables in the world-sheet

theory are expected to become also physical in the sense of space-time. this is the simplest

assumption to realize this correspondence.

the fth condition is more subtle. in the usual (untwisted) string theory, this is nothing

but a result of brst-invariance. however, we cannot derive this condition from the qs-

invariance. nevertheless the reason why we believe this condition is natural is as follows:
in a general cf t2 the back-ground charge term t (z)a(w)  
(z  w)3    is related with
the anomaly term on a curved world-sheet; a(z)  qr(2). so, if we require that all of
the generators in the space-time conformal algebra should be conserved charges even on the

curved world-sheet, we need impose this condition on it. this condition is quite important as

a guiding principle to look for the correct answer. for example, the space-time u(1)r current

in the untwisted model has a non-zero back-ground charge with respect to the stress tensor

t top (2.15) (after the replacement +  21,   21, etc.), and hence we cannot take
this current as the candidate for the ghost number current jn in the space-time tca.

we here make one comment: the topological gravity sector (especially, the scalar eld

2

) seems to play an important role in order to obtain the correct conformal algebra in space-

time. in fact, it is not so dicult to show that we cannot construct the conformal algebra

which satises all the ve conditions above without topological gravity sector. why it is so

may be interesting problem. we would like to further discuss this point (from a geometrical

point of view, maybe) elsewhere.

before leaving the arguments in the near boundary approximation, let us discuss the

space-time vacuum (long string vacuum) which realizes i 1d = p 6= 0 in topological
theory. by making use of the familiar bosonizations:  = iy exiy ,  = ex+iy , where
x(z)x(0)   ln z, y (z)y (0)   ln z, we can immediately make up a qs-invariant (and not
qs-exact) state having such a property within the large hilbert space of 4. we set

v
v 1

def= 1exe  1cexe
def= 1exe  1bexe.

(3.8)

they are qs-invariant: [qs, v 1] = 0 and v  v 1 = v 1  v = 1. moreover they satisfy

(cid:20)i 1d, v 1(cid:21) = v 1.

(3.9)

it is easy to see we can consider the operator products v  v   , v 1  v 1    without any
regularization of divergenece. therefore we can introduce the following space-time vacuum

in our topological model;

|vac; pi def= v p|0i

(p  z),

(3.10)

4it may be worthwhile to emphasize that we must here work on the large hilbert space rather than the

reduced space projected byi eiy = 0. this is because we need the negative powers of  as well as the positive

powers in the original construction of the space-time virasoro algebra by gks [9].

13

which is manifestly qs-invariant and satises

i 1d|vac; pi = p|vac; pi

(3.11)

for any winding number p  z.

it is interesting to compare this result with that for the untwisted theory. the operator

vuntwisted in the untwisted fermionic string theory should be given by

vuntwisted

def= +cexe.

(3.12)

this operator is brst-invariant (and not exact) in the framework of the untwisted fermionic
string, and also satises [lgks
space-time virasoro generators given in [9]. the space-time vacuum for p = 1 is dened as

, v ] = 0 (mod brst) for n  1, where lgks

n

n

denote the

|vaciuntwisted

def= vuntwisted|0i,

(3.13)

which is no other than the (1)-picture version of that introduced in [15]. (remember that
in this paper we write the bosonized superghost as  instead of the usual notation .).
since one can again dene the operator products vuntwisted  vuntwisted    without any reg-
ularization, one might imagine that the space-time vacuum for any p  z can be dened
simlarly as (3.10). but this naive guess does not work. in fact, we can prove that v p
(p  2) becomes brst-exact, and moreover the operator corresponding to v 1 (which is
given by replacing 1 with  in the expression (3.8)) does not become brst-invariant in the
untwisted theory. this observation suggests the claim given in [15]: one can only construct

untwisted

the space-time vacuum for p = 1 on the single string world-sheet, and in order to realize the
cases p  2 one should consider the multi-string system desribed by symp orbifold theory.
this claim is consistent with the naive estimation of physical degrees of freedom, because the

winding number p should correspond to a brane charge (ns1 charge), and is related with the

upper bound for the u(1)r charges of the chiral primary elds in the boundary cft [32].

on the other hand, as seen above, in the topological string we can make up the space-time

vacuum for an arbitrary winding p on a single string world-sheet. it is not a contradiction,

since the winding in topological string does not correspond to any brane charge, and we

can show that we have no upper bound for the u(1)r charge related to the value of p in

the topological model. the topological gravity sector seems to play an essential role in this

feature because of the existence of gravitational descentants. of course, in order to complete

14

this discussion we need to analyse carefully the detailed structure of physical spectum in the

topological theory. this analysis will be given in [33].

3.2 space-time topological conformal algebra in finite 

now let us consider the more general situation when the string world-sheet exists far from

boundary. in this case the free eld description does not work, although we still have an ane

sl(2; r) symmetry. to this aim it is useful to introduce auxiliary parameters x, x, which are

naturally identied with the coordinates on boundary, according to the works [6, 10, 11, 22],
and to write down directly the space-time conformal currents as t (x), g(x), j (x) instead
of dealing with their fourier modes. in particular, we shall follow the convention of [11], and

refer to the above papers [6, 10, 11, 22] for the more detailed arguments.

first of all, let us introduce

j(x; z) def= 2xj3  x2j(z)  j+(z),

which satises the following ope;

j(x; z)j(y; w)  (k + 2)

(y  x)2
(z  w)2 +

1

z  w n(y  x)2y  2(y  x)o j(y; w).

(3.14)

(3.15)

the counterpart in the right mover j(x; z) is similarly dened. it is also convenient to intro-

duce the notation

j(x; z) def= j(x; z) + 2xs k

2

k(z).

(3.16)

these currents (3.14), (3.16) have the weight (1,0) for world-sheet and the weight (1, 0) for
space-time. (the boundary coordinates x, x should have the space-time dimensions (1, 0),
(0,1) respectively). the primary eld in space-time is dened by



1
2k + e (z)
|x  (z)|2e

h(x, x; z, z) def=

1

 


2h

,

(z)

2k

(3.17)

which is an analog of the bulk-boundary green funciton. this operator should have the

following ope with the current j(x; z);

j(x; z)h(y, y; w, w) 

1

z  w n(y  x)2y + 2h(y  x)o h(y, y; w, w),

(3.18)

15

which means h indeed has the space-time conformal weight (h, h). for our purpose the h = 1

case is the most important;

j(x; z)1(y, y; w, w) 

1

z  w

yn(y  x)21(y, y; w, w)o ,

and it is easy to see

lim

+

1(x, x; z, z) = 2(x  (z)).

we must further prepare the fermionic partners of the above currents. we set

which satisfy the ope;

(x; z)

(x; z)

def= 1(z) + x2(z)
def= x1(z) + 2(z),

(x; z)(y; w)  (x; z)(y; w) 

x  y
z  w

.

(3.19)

(3.20)

(3.21)

(3.22)

(x; z) should have the world-sheet weight (0, 0) and the space-time wight (1, 0). (x; z)
should have (1, 0) for world-sheet and (0, 0) for space-time.

under these preparations we can propose the following currents as the suitable topological
conformal algebra in space-time {g(x), t (x), j (x)}. to avoid the complexity of notations
we shall use the abbreviations;   (x; z),   (x; z), j  j(x; z) etc.;

in these expressions one should regard the products of operators inserted at the same points

on world-sheet as the standard normal product dened by

a(z)b(z) def= iz

dw

a(w)b(z)

w  z

.

(3.24)

now, why can we claim that they are the correct currents in the space-time conformal

algebra?

first of all, we can derive the ward identities of these currents {t (x), g(x), j (x)} by
means of the methods outlined in [11] without using the free eld approximations. we only
have to evaluate the correlators having the forms; hxa(x)a(y)o . . .i , where a(x), a(y) are
one of {t (x), g(x), j (x)}, and o . . . means the suitable primary operators in space-time
cft. in these calculations we can make use of the formulas (3.15), (3.19), (3.22) and among
other things5

1(x, x; z, z)h(y, y; z, z) = 2(x  y)h(y, y; z, z).

the following identities are also useful;

(3.30)

we shall not present here the explicit forms of the ward identities among the currents
{t (x), g(x), j (x)} (3.23), but the important point is as follows: these ward identities
are nicely interpreted as the opes among them, and we can prove that they truly generate

5this formula (3.25) is justied only by semiclassical calculations in [11]. but, we here assume the validity

of this identity in quantum level.

i =

here i is actually a constant on the boundary xi = xi = 0, and under the long string

conguration near boundary this constant reduces to

detailed arguments, especially with respect to the contribution from the short string sector,

i = i 1d.

(for the more

secondly, we can show that the currents (3.23) reduce to the free eld realizations (3.5) in

the near boundary limit   +. under this limit we have

where l.h.s means the normal product dened by (3.24) and the symbol :

means the normal ordered product of free elds.

there is an important consistency check for the space-time currents (3.23). we must show
that {g(x), t (x), j (x)} are actually holomorphic, that is, they have no singular opes
with their anti-holomorphic counterparts { g(y), t (y), j (y)}. it is not a trivial statement
in contrast to the case of free elds (3.5), since the expressions of (3.23) include the terms
x(j1) which may have singular opes with the anti-holomorphic currents. for
such as  
this purpose we rst conrm the next identity;

{ qs, a(x)} = 0,
we can show by simple calculations

(a(x)  {g(x), t (x), j (x)}).

[ qs, n

x (j1)] =

(3.33)

(3.34)

hence we obtain

(cid:20) qs, z d2z n

x (j1)f (j, , , . . .)(cid:21) = z d2z z() = 0,

(3.35)

for an arbitrary polynomial f of only the holomorphic operators j(x; z), (x; z), (x; z), . . .,

which proves the above identity (3.33). nextly, it is not so hard to prove

x g(x)a(y)  0, x j (x)a(y)  0,

(a(y)  {g(y), t (y), j (y)}).
in the proof for them we can make use of the next identitity (and its cousins);

(3.36)

dz1(x, x; z, z)(j(y; w)1(y, y; w, w)) = 2(xy)2(xy)(xy)2x2(xy) = 0. (3.37)
k[ qs, j ], t =

i w
because of the above results (3.33), (3.36) and also the relations g+ = 
k{ qs, g}, we can also conclude that

x g+(x)a(y)  0, x t (x)a(y)  0,

(a(y)  {g(y), t (y), j (y)}),

(3.38)

which are no other than the claims we should conrm.

4 conclusions

in this paper we explored the topologically twisted fermionic string theory on the general
back-ground ads3  n which is compatible with n = 2 susy on world-sheet. we summa-
rized the structure of the wold-sheet topological theory, and showed that the dual space-time

(boundary) theory should become also a topological conformal eld theory. our main result

is the construction of space-time conformal algebra from the world-sheet picture. firstly we

considered the near boundary approximation, which is described by the wakimoto free eld

representation, and secondly we took the more rigid formulation which is still valid far from

the boundary according to that given in [11]. the space-time algebra we derived became a

twisted n = 2 superconformal algebra with c = 2ki 1d. although this c is equal to that

of the twisted version of the space-time n = 2 algebra given in [20], these two are not the

same. the generators of the latter are not brst-invariant in the topological string theory,

and so cannot be regarded as the symmetry of the space-time topological theory which is dual

19

to the world-sheet topological theory. nevertheless it might be interesting to study further

the relation between them. for example, one of the interesting questions is whether or not

there exists a good modication, such as a similarity transformation, from the former to the

latter.

as we emphasized, the topological string has only the world-sheet fermions with integral

spins, and hence we cannot have spin elds. these eld contents on world-sheet are analogus

to that given in [13], which is based on the free eld realizations of ane lie superalgebra and
is deeply connected with the recent hybrid formalism [34] for the ads3  s3 superstring
(in the special case with bn s 6= 0, brr = 0). especially, it may be worthwhile to point out
that the complex scalar  in the topological gravity sector (2.20) has the same world-sheet

property as that of the ghost eld in [34]. it might be interesting to discuss in detail the

relationship between the topologically twisted theory and the framework of hybrid formalism.

analysis on physical spectrum in our topological string theory is signicant. as several

authors pointed out [19, 22, 23] (see also [5, 6]), there are still several open problems and

pathologies in (fermionic) string theory on ads3, in particular with respect to the analyses

on physical spectra. fortunately, in the toplogically twisted theory it seems that the spectrum

becomes rather simple and we need not face such pathologies. this is because only the 1/2

bps states can be physical in the topological theory. however, there may be a few subtleties

in this spectrum, for example, about the eld identication rules of chiral primary elds. we

will study the spectra in detail for some concrete examples in future work [33].
