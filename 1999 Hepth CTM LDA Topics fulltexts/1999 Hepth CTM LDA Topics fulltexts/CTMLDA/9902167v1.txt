abstract

in this paper, based on the available mathematical works on geometry and
topology of hyperbolic manifolds and discrete groups, some results of freed-
man et al (hep-th/9804058) are reproduced and broadly generalized.among
many new results the possibility of extension of work of belavin,polyakov
and zamolodchikov to higher dimensions is investigated. known in physical
literature objections against such extension are removed and the possibility
of an extension is convinsingly demonstrated

introduction

recently,there had been attempts to extend the results of two dimensional
conformal eld theories to higher dimensions [1.2]. since publication the fun-
damental works by witten[3, 4]it has become clear that there is a very close
connection between 2d physics of critical phenomena and 3d physics of knots
and links. a very detailed study of this correspondence is developed in the
fundamental work of moore and seiberg [5] .additional contributions were
more recently made in ref[6],etc. the above works heavily exploit the alge-
braic aspects of this correspondence through use of yang-baxter equations
,quantum groups,etc. much lesser eorts had been spent on development of
the same correspondence from the topological point of view through study of
3-manifolds which are complementary to knots(links) in s3=r3  {}.such
study is potentially more benecial since it is known [7] that in four dimen-
sions all knots are trivial (i.e.unknotted) so that the algebraic methods used
so far are necessarily limited to 3 dimensions and,accordingly, to study of
two dimensional conformal eld theories only.at the same time, topological
study of manifolds is not limited to three dimensions. the reasons why such
studies are useful could be understood from the following simple arguments
taken from the book by maskit [8]

dene an inclusion of rd into rd+1 through rd ={(x,t)| t = 0} where
x rd,   t  . the upper half space poincare model of hyperbolic
space hd+1is dened by

hd+1 = {(x, t) | t > 0}

(1.1)

with x  rd so that hd+1 = rd .consider a special group g of motions
g=md+1of rd+1 = {x, t} made of

a) translations:
b) rotations :
c) dilatations :
d) inversions :

(x,t) (x + a, t) ,a rd1 ;
(x,t) (r(x),t) ,

r o(d  1);

x x , > 0,  6= 1 and
x x

|x|2 .

it can be proven[8] that the group g acts as a group of isometries of
hd+1and is called d dimensional mobius group.in its action on rd g acts
as a group of conformal motions but not as a group of isometries in any
metric.

surely,it is well established[9] that in any dimension the physical system
at criticality possesses the invariance which is described in terms of the group

2

g. hence,the very existence of criticality is closely associated with
the hyperbolicity of the adjacent space.

let x h d+1 and  g. consider a motion (an orbit) in hd+1by successive
applications of  to x. it is of interest to study if such a motion will ever hit
hd+1 = rd. this problem is highly nontrivial and was solved by beardon
and maskit[10] (e.g.see section 5 for more details) for d=2. the nontriviality
of this problem could be better understood if,instead of the upper half space
hd+1model,we would consider the unit ball bd+1 model of the hyperbolic
space with the unit sphere sd
 (sphere at innity) playing the same role as
in this model as hd+1 = rd in the upper half space model.since not all
subgroups of g will allow hitting of the boundary,it is clear,that one should
be interested only in those subgroups whose orbits end up at the bound-
ary. these subgroups ,in turn,could be further subdivided into those whose
limit points on sd
 will cover the entire sphere and those which will cover
only a part of sd
.this part we shall denote as .the limit set  is actu-
ally a fractal . the fractal dimension of  is directly related to the critical
indices of the two-point correlation functions of the corresponding confor-
mal models at criticality.dierent subgroups of mobius group g will produce
dierent fractal dimensions.in turn,the corresponding hyperbolic manifolds
associated with these groups could be viewed as complements of the related
knots (links) in case of 2+1 dimensions so that dierent conformal models
are indeed could be associated with dierent knots(links).this association be-
comes unnecessary when one is interested in conformal models in dimensions
3 and higher. one could still consider motions associated with subgroups
of mobius group and the corresponding,say,hyperbolic 4-manifolds without
using knots,braids,yang-baxter equations,etc.

although not stated as explicitly as above,the recent results of maldacena[11]

and their subsequent renements in refs[12-16] (and many additional refer-
ences therein and elsewhere which we do not include) are actually directly
connected with the ideas just described.hence,in part,the purpose of this
work is to develop detailed connections between the results obtained in
physics literature and those known in mathematics.not only it is possible
to reobtain all relevant physical results but many more follow along the way
of physical reinterpretation of the results known in mathematics .it hap-
pens,that these physical results ,if properly interpreted,are directly linked
with many aspects of modern mathematics which include the geometry and
topology of hyperbolic manifolds[17],multidimensional extension of the the-

3

ory of teichmuller spaces[18],spectral analysis of hyperbolic manifolds[19] ,in-
cluding those with cusps[20],random walks on group manifolds[21],theory of
deformations of kleinian and fuchsian groups[22](and mobius groups in gen-
eral),ergodic theory of discrete groups[23],kodaira-spencer theory of defor-
mations of complex manifolds[24],loop groups[25],cohomology of groups,etc.in
particular,the cohomological aspects of these connections lead directly to the
virasoro algebra and its generalizations thus allowing us to dicuss the exten-
sion of fundamental results of belavin-polyakov-zamolodchikov(bpz)[26]to
higher dimensions(e.g.see section 8).to make our presentation self-contained,we
had incorporated some the auxiliary results from mathematics into text which
, hopefully, are meant only to facilitate readers understanding without de-
tracting of his/her attention from physical goals and motivations. a quick
summary of some auxiliary mathematical results related to hyperbolic 3-
manifolds could be also found in our earlier papers,refs[28,29].

this paper is organized as follows.

in section 2 we discuss an aux-
iliary plateau problem in d+1 dimensional euclidean space. already in
two dimensions the full analysis of the plateau problem is quite nontriv-
ial as it was demonstrated in classical work of douglas published in 1939
[29].multidimensional treatment of this problem is even more nontrivial and
touches many subtle aspects of the harmonic analysis [30].nevertheless,the
extension of the euclidean variant of the plateau problem to the hyperbolic
hd+1space is actually not dicult and was accomplished rather long time
ago by ahlfors[17] .using the results of ahlfors we were able to reobtain the
results of freedman et al ,ref[12],almost straightforwardly in section 3. we
deliberately considering only the scalar eld case in this work since the exten-
sion of our treatment to vector and tensor elds (to be briey considered in
section 8 ) does not cause much additional conceptual problems .to gener-
alize the results of section 3 and to put them in an appropriate mathematical
context ,we discuss in section 4 diusion in the hyperbolic space.this is done
with several purposes. first, using symmetries of the laplace operator act-
ing in the hyperbolic space it is possible to subdivide brownian motions on
transient and recurrent.only transient motions can reach the boundary of
the hyperbolic space. the transience and/or recurrence is associated with
convergence /or divergence of certain innite sums known as poincare se-
ries.the convergence or divergence is being controlled by the critical exponent
.patterson[31] ,sullivan[32],ahlfors[17] ,thurston [33] and others [23] had
shown that this exponent is associated with the fractal dimension of the limit

4

set .stated in physical terms,it is shown in section 5 that this exponent is
associated with the exponent 2 for the two-point correlation function of
the corresponding boundary conformal eld theory (ies).the exponent  de-
pends upon the group of motions in hd+1 .the group is directly associated
with the hyperbolic manifold so that dierent groups associated with dif-
ferent manifolds will produce dierent s.being armed with these ideas
it is possible to improve the existing physical results using spectral theory
of hyperbolic manifolds in section 6. in this section it is shown that the ob-
tained eigenvalue spectrum of the hyperbolic laplacian discussed in physics
literature is incomplete and much more results could be obtained with help
of the existing mathematical literature,e.g.see ref.[19].for instance ,2d crit-
ical exponent 2 for the ising model is almost straightforwardly obtained
with help of the recently obtained results of bishop and jones[34] .with this
result obtained ,it is only natural to look for connections between the bound-
ary conformal eld theory results and those coming from the fundamental
work of bpz[26] .the connection can be established rather easily,e.g.see sec-
tion 7 ,based on the theory of deformation of kleinian groups[22] which is
closely connected with the theory of teichmuller spaces[35] .indeed,as it was
demonstrated by bers[36] some time ago,one of the sources which generates
new kleinian groups from the old ones is through the extension of the
quasiconformal deformations produced at the boundary  = s2
   of the
hyperbolic space into the bulk.the theory of such deformations was under
development in mathematics for quite some time. however,the results which
are absolutely essential for making connections with current physics litera-
ture had been obtained by mathematicians only quite recently. in particu-
lar,canary and taylor[37] had demonstrated that the limit set of kleinian
groups which produce critical exponents  in physically interesting range
(e.g.
for 0< < 1 one obtains the correct ising model critical exponent
2 = 1/4, etc.) is a circle s1,perhaps, with some points(or,may be,segments)
being removed (please,see section 7 for more details). these facts natu-
rally explain the crucial role being played by the loop groups and the loop
algebras[25] in the conformal eld theories and other exactly integrable sys-
tems [38].at the same time, nag and verjovsky[39] had demonstrated how
the boundary deformations of such circle is connected with the central exten-
sion term in the virasoro algebra thus providing major physical reasons
for existence of such term.moreover,the analysis of the seminal work by nag
and verjovsky indicates that ,actually, their main results are based entirely
on much earlier work by ahlfors[40] . the virasoro algebra and all results of

5

the conformal eld theories[26] could be obtained much earlier should work
by ahlfors[40] written in 1961 be properly interpreted at that time ! ahlfors
and many others following him(e.g.see ref[18]for some review) had devel-
oped extension of his 2 dimensional results to hyperbolic spaces of higher
dimensions.when these results are being put in a proper physical context
they allow extension of the bpz formalism to higher dimensions.the possi-
bility of such extension(s) is discussed in section 8.the key points of devel-
opments presented in section 8 are the following.based on the work by nag
and verjovsky[38] ,one should look for extension of their results to higher
dimensions. fortunately, this was accomplished to a large extent already by
ahlfors[17](although the complete picture had begun to emerge only more
recently [41,42]).next,one should take into account that the conformal group
in d dimensions is isomorphic to the lie group o(d+1,1) which is the de sit-
ter group as was noticed already by cartan in 1920[43]. .for d=2 we have
group o(3,1) which is just the lorentz group and the connected part of this
group is isomorphic with psl(2,c) group[44].the lie algebra of this group is
in the center of the virasoro algebra. the central extension of this algebra is
just the virasoro algebra .for d=3 we have the lie group o(4,1).the repre-
sentations of the lie algebra for this group,fortunately,were studied both in
mathematics[45, 46] and in physics[47, 48] in connection with exact algebraic
solution of the hydrogen atom problem. since the hydrogen atom is exactly
solvable quantum mechanical problem,construction of representations of the
lie algebra of the de sitter lie group is also possible.it is facilitated by the
major observation[45, 47]that the lie algebra of the de sitter group can be
represented as direct tensor product of the lie algebras for the group
so(3) p sl(2, c) .hence,it is possible to construct the central extensions
for each of the lie algebras so(3) thus forming two virasoro algebras with
possibly dierent central charges(other possibilities also exist and briey dis-
cussed in the same section).the central extension of the de sitter lie algebra
can be built then based on the tensor product of two copies of the virasoro
algebras with possibly dierent central charges. the constructions of this
type of tensor products and their representations were already discussed in
the literature ,e.g.see lecture 12 of ref.[48] .hence,analysis of exponents of
various 3d conformal eld theories is becoming possible now only because
the hydrogen atom model is exactly solvable !

ii. the plateau problem in d+1 dimensional euclidean

space

the classical plateau problem,when stated mathematically,essentially co-
incides with the dirichlet problem. in two dimensions the dirichlet problem
can be formulated as follows:among functions (z) , z  a (where a is some
closed domain of the complex plane c) which take values 0(z) at a nd
such that the dirichlet integral d[]dened by

d[] =zza

d2z(~  ~)

(2.1)

has the lowest possible value.evidently,the above problem can be reduced to
the problem of nding the harmonic function (z) , i.e. the function which
obeys the laplace equation

 = 0 if z  a but z / a

and takes at the boundary a the preassigned values

 |a= 0(z) .

(2.2)

(2.3)

if g(z, z) is the greens function of the laplace operator  ,then the har-
monic function which possess the above properties is given by the following
boundary integral

(z) = za

d0()

g
n

(2.4)

with normal derivative taken with respect to the direction of the exterior
normal.use of greens formulas allows one to rewrite the dirichlet integral
in the following equivalent form

d[] =zza

d2z(~  ~) =za

d0()


n

|z=

by combining eq.s (2.4) and (2.5) we obtain,

d[] = za

taking into account that

which implies

we can rewrite eq.(2.6) in the following equivalent form

d[] =

1

2z dz d[0()  0()]2 2g

nn

(2.7)

(2.8)

.

(2.9)

eq.(2.9) was derived by douglas[29] in 1939 in connection with his exten-
sive study of the plateau problem and serves as starting point of all further
investigations related to two dimensional plateau problem.

in the case if a is extended (long enough) contour , following douglas,we

can use the greens function for the half space given by

g(z, z) = 

1
4

ln

(x  x)2 + (y  y)2
(x  x)2 + (y + y)2

(2.10)

with z=x+iy, y>0. to get 2g
of y and y in eq.(2.10).this then produces,

nn we have to keep only the innitesimal values

so that

g(z, z)  

1


yy

(x  x)2 ,

2g
nn =

1


1

(x  x)2 .

using this result in eq.(2.9) we obtain,

d[] =

1

2z dz d[0()  0()]2

1

(  )2 .

8

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

this result is evidently nonsingular for the well behaved function 0() and
the requirements put on 0() needed for d[] to be nondivergent could be
found in the already cited paper by douglas[29].

obtained results can be easily extended now to higher dimensions. to
do so ,we have to specify the metric of the underlying space. below we
shall develop our results for the case of euclidean spaces of dimensional-
ity d+1 while in the next section we shall extend these results to the case
of hyperbolic(lobachevski) space hd+1 .
in case of d+1 euclidean space
it is sucient(0) to consider the dirichlet problem for the half-space :{x,z
| z>0}so that dd+1x = ddxdz and (x) = (x,z) with 0(x)  (x, 0)
or,equivalently,in the unit d+1 dimensional ball bd+1 .an analogue of the
poisson formula, eq.(2.4),is known [30]

(x, z) =za

ddx pe(z, x  x)0(x)

(2.14)

with

pe(z, x  x) = cd+1

z

[(x  x)2 + z2]

where cd+1 =

2

(d+1)v (b) with

(2.15)

(2.16)

[(d+1)/2]! if d+1 is even
2
133(d+1) if d+1 is odd

2 

d+2

d
2

v (b) =


for example,if d+1=2 we obtain c2 = 1
 .this result is in accord with
eq.(2.11) since using this equation and prescription of douglas [29] we obtain,

pe(z, x  x) =


n

g =

1


z

z2 + (x  x)2 .

(2.17)

by repeating the same steps as in two dimensional case ,we obtain now the
following value for the dirichlet integral

d[] =

cd+1

2 za

ddxza

ddx[0(x)  0(x)]2

1

|x  x|d+1 .

(2.18)

9

this result coincides with earlier obtained ,eq.(2.13),for the case of two di-
mensions as required.evidently,it could be made nonsingular if the boundary
function 0(x)is appropriately chosen.eq. (2.18) diers from that known in
physical literature,e.g. see ref.[49] where ,instead,the following value for the
dirichlet integral was obtained

d[] = adza

ddxza

ddx 0(x)0(x)
|x  x|d+1

(2.19)

with constant ad left unspecied. such integral could be potentially divergent
,unlike that given by eq.(2.18),and ,therefore, provides no acceptable solution
to the dirichlet (or plateau) problem in any dimension. obtained results can
be easily generalized to the case of hyperbolic space. this generalization is
being treated in the next section.

iii. the plateau problem in d+1 dimensional hyper-

bolic space

since the euclidean variant of the anti desitter space is just a normal
hyperbolic space hd+1 as was noticed in ref.[13],we shall treat only the hy-
perbolic dirichlet (plateau) problem in this paper.

as it was shown by ahlfors[17] the greens formulas of harmonic analysis
survive transfer to the hyperbolic space with minor modications. for exam-
ple,for arbitrary (but well behaved) functions u and v the greens formula
analogue for the hyperbolic space is given by

zv

uhvdhx =zv

u

v
nh

 dh zv

(~hu  ~hv)dxh .

(3.1)

in particular,if u = v and u is hyperharmonic, i.e.

hu = 0

in v

then,

d[u] =zv

dxh(~hu  ~hu) =zv

u

u
nh

 dh

10

(3.2)

(3.3)

which is the hyperbolic analogue of eq.(2.5). the subscript h in all above
equations stands for hyperbolic.in particular,in case of bd+1(d+1 dimen-
sional ball of unit radius) model of hyperbolic space we have for hyperbolic
laplacian the following result

hf (r) =

1
4

(1  r2)2[f +

2(d  1)
1  r2 r

f
r

]

with r = |x| , ( |x| =sd+1
pi=1

x2
i ) and

f (r) =

d2
dr2 f +

d
r

df
dr

(3.4)

(3.5)

while in case of the upper half space realization of the hyperbolic space we
have as well

hf (x,z) = z2[f  (d  1)

1
z

f
z

] ,

z>0.

(3.6)

it can be easily shown[23] that for the upper half space model the following
eigenfunction equation holds

hz = (  d)z

(3.7)

so that the function zd is hyperharmonic since it obeys the hyperharmonic
generalization of the laplace eq. (2.2):

in the case of bd+1 model we have as well [17]

hzd = 0.

dxh =

2d+1dx1dx2...dxd+1

(1  |x|2)d+1

,

dh =

2ddx1dx2...dxd

(3.8)

(3.9)

(3.10)

(3.11)

~hu =

1  |x|2

2

~u .

(3.12)

the analogous formulas could be obtained for the hd+1 model as well.the
hyperbolic laplacian h possesses very important property of mobius invari-
ance which can be formulated as follows.let x = x be mobius transforma-
tion of the hyperbolic space , i.e. let    where  is the group of isometries
which leave hd+1(or bd+1) invariant then,for any function f, such that

we have as well

hf (x) = f (x)

hf (x) = f (x).

(3.13a)

(3.13b)

in particular,if the function f (x) is hyperharmonic,then the function f (x)
is also hyperharmonic. we have already mentioned,e.g. eq.(3.7) ,that the
function zd is hyperharmonic. now we would like to use the property of the
hyperharmonic laplacian given by eq.(3.13b) in order to obtain more general
form of the hyperharmonic function in hd+1.using known results for mobius
transformations in hd+1 one easily obtains (with accuracy up to unimportant
constant)

f (x) =(cid:20)

z

|z2 + (x  x)2|2(cid:21)d

.

(3.14)

in this case
let us check this result for the case of two dimensions rst.
d=1 in eq.(3.14) and we obtain (with accuracy up to constant) eq.(2.17).
this fact is not totally coincidental since,in view of eq. (3.6),the hyperbolic
laplacian coincides with the usual one for d=1.therefore,we can write as
well in d+1 dimensions:

ph(z, x  x) = cd(cid:20)

z

|z2 + (x  x)2|2(cid:21)d

,

(3.15)

to be compared with eq. (2.15). to calculate the constant cd we have to
use known general properties of the poisson kernels[30]. in particular,the
normalization requirement

cdz ddx(cid:20)

z

|z2 + x2|2(cid:21)d

= 1

12

(3.16)

makes ph to act as probability density.this fact is going to be exploited
below.

using spherical system of coordinates we easily obtain

c1
d = d



z0

dx

xd1

(x2 + 1)d =

d
2

( d

2 )( d
2)
(d)

(3.17)

where d is the surface area of d-dimensional unit sphere ,

d =

d

2

2
( d
2)

.

(3.18)

by combining this result with eq.(3.17) we obtain,

cd =

(d)
2 ( d
2)

d



.

(3.19)

given the results above,to obtain the dirichlet integral using eq.(3.3) is
rather straightforward,especially by working in hd+1 space. in this case we
have to replace eq.s (3.9)-(3.12) by the following equivalent expressions:

and

dh =

ddx
xd
0

u
nh

= x0

u
x0

(3.20)

(3.21)

while keeping in mind eq.(3.16). with these remarks we obtain at once

d[] = dcdz ddxz ddx 0(x)0(x)

|x  x|2d

.

(3.22)

this result coincides with that obtained in refs[12],[15].where it was obtained
methods which are noticeably dierent from ours.

from the discussion presented in section 2 it is clear that this result
can be rewritten in a manifestly nonsingular way thus removing need for
renormalization advocated in ref.[14].actually,there is much more to it as
we shall demonstrate shortly below.

13

iv. diusion in the hyperbolic space and boundary

conformal eld theories

the connection between the klein-gordon (k-g) and the schrodinger
propagators had been discussed already by feynman long time ago and had
been exploited recently in ref.[50].for readers convenience,we would like
to repeat here these simple arguments. to this purpose,let us consider the
equation for k-g propagator in euclidean space rst. we have

by introducing the ctitious (or real) time variable t the auxiliary equation

(cid:0)  m2(cid:1) g(x, x) = d(x  x) .

(4.1)


t

g(x, x; t) =(cid:0)  m2(cid:1) g(x, x; t)

supplemented with the initial condition

g(x, x; t = 0) = d(x  x)

(4.2)

(4.3)

is useful to consider in connection with eq.(4.1).the correctness of the ini-
tial condition could be easily cheked.indeed,since the solution of eq.(4.2) is
known to be

g(x, x; t) =z ddk

(2)d exp{ik  (x  x)  t(k2 + m2)}

(4.4)

one obtains immediately the result given by eq.(4.3). at the same time, if
the solution of eq.(4.2) is known then, the solution of eq.(4.1) is known as
well and is given simply by

g(x, x) =



z0

dt g(x, x; t) .

(4.5)

one can do even better by noticing that the mass term in eq.(4.2) can be
simply eliminated by using the following substitution:

g(x, x; t) = em2t g(x, x; t) .

(4.6)

14

thus introduced function g obeys the standard diusion equation:


t

g(x, x; t) =  g(x, x; t) .

(4.7)

from the theory of random walks it is well known[50] that in the case of
m2 = 0 and x = x the quantity

g(0) =



z0

dt g(0; t)

(4.8)

represents the average time < t > which brownian particle spends at the
origin(initial point).the probability (0) of returning to the origin is known
to be related to g(0) as follows[50]

(0) = 1 

1

g(0)

.

(4.9)

accordingly,the random walk is recurrent or transient depending upon
(0) being equal or lesser than one.the recurrent means that the particle
will
come to the origin time and again while the transient means that
nite probability it will leave the origin and may never come back.

thus,from the point of view of the theory of brownian motion the dirich-
let problem in sections 2 and 3 is associated with the question about the
probability for the random walker to reach the boundary sd
 (in the case of
bd+1 model)or rd (in the case of hd+1model)of the hyperbolic space or, al-
ternatively, the random walk must be transient in order to be able to reach
the boundary.this can be formulated also as the condition

g(0) < 

(4.10)

for the dirichlet problem to be well posed.this condition may or may not
take place as we shall discuss shortly.
in the meantime,we would like to
return to the massive case in order to extend to this case the above described
concepts.using eq. (3.7) we obtain now for the massive case the following
requirement

(  d)  m2 = 0

(4.11)

15

for the function z to remain hyperharmonic. eq. (4.11) leads to the follow-
ing values of  :

1,2 =

d
2

s(cid:18)d
2(cid:19)2

+ m2 .

(4.12)

to determine which of the values of  are acceptable ,it is sucient only to
check the normalization condition analogous to that used in eq. (3.16).to
this purpose the poisson-like formula (e.g. see eq.(2.14)) is helpful. in the
present case we have

(x, z) = czrd

ddx(cid:20)

z

(x  x)2 + z2(cid:21)

0(x) .

(4.13)

if  = d ,then it is easy to see that for 0(x)=const the r.h.s. of eq.(4.13)
is z-independent. if  6= d ,then after rescaling: x x
z  y ,we are left with
the factor zd under the integral.this factor can be eliminated if we require

zd0(yz) = 0(y).

(4.14)

this provides the boundary eld 0 with the scaling dimension 0 = d  
in complete accord with ref.[12] where this result was obtained by use of
slightly dierent set of arguments.

now we are in the position to determine the actual value of the constant

c.by analogy with eq.(3.17) we obtain,

c1
 = d

(x2 + 1) =

d

(  d

or, alternatively,

c =

d

2 (  d
2 )

.

(4.15)

for  = d
2 the above equation becomes singular. this observation leaves us
with an option of choosing + sign in eq.(4.12). this option, is not the
only one as it will be demonstrated below. in addition, the mass m2 should
for the sake of the normalization requirement.. these

2(cid:1)2
be larger than -(cid:0) d

16

conclusions coincide with the results of sullivan [32] who reached them by
using a somewhat dierent set of arguments.using eq.(4.13) and repeating
the same steps as in the massless case,e.g.see eqs.(3.20)-(3.22),we obtain for
the dirichlet integral the following nal result:

d[] = c+z ddxz ddx 0(x)0(x)

|x  x|2+

.

(4.16)

eq.(4.16) is in formal agreement with results obtained in refs[12],[15].unlike
refs[12],[15],where no further analysis of these results was made ,we would
like to examine obtained results in more detail. as we had mentioned already
in the introduction,according to maskit[8] the group of mobius transforma-
tions acts as a group of isometries of the hyperbolic space hd+1( or bd+1)
but not at the boundary .at the boundary of the hyperbolic space it acts
only as a group of conformal motions which is not a group of isometries in
any metric[8]. if we take into account that the isometric motions in (or of)
the hyperbolic space are described by a group  of mobius transformations ,
then eq.s(4.5),(4.6) should be modied.in particular,we should write instead
of eq.(4.5) the following result:

g(x, x) =x



z0

dtem2t g(x, x; t).

(4.17)

the integral in eq. (4.17) can be estimated ,e.g.see the discussion presented
in sections 5 and 6,and is roughly given by



z0

dtem2t g(x, x; t). . c exp{+(x, x)}

(4.18)

where (x, x) is the hyperbolic distance between x and x.it can be shown
[31], [23], that the convergence or divergence of the poincare series

g+(x, x) =x

exp{+(x, x)}

(4.19)

is actually independent of x and x . whence,one can choose as well both
x and x at the center of the hyperbolic ball bd+1. then, if the poincare
series is divergent,we have the recurrence (or ergodicity[32], [23]) according

17

to eq.(4.9) ,and if it is convergent,we have the transience.in this case the
random walk which had originated somewhere inside of the hyperbolic space
is going to end up its motion at the boundary of this space.the exponent
+ which is responsible for this process of convergence or divergence is
associated with particular kleinian (mobius) group  so that dierent groups
may have dierent exponents.to facilitate readers understanding ,we would
like to provide an introduction into these very interesting topics in the next
section.

v. the limit sets of kleinian groups

by denition, kleinian groups are groups of isometries of h3 (or b3)
,e.g.see ref[8],while mobius groups are groups of isometries of hd+1(or bd+1)
for d 1. hence, kleinian groups are just a special case of the mobius
groups.recall also that kleinian groups are just complex version of fuch-
sian groups acting on h2.

let  be one of such groups and let    be some representative element
of such group.for an arbitrary x hd+1 the group  acts discontinuously
if x  x is nonempty only for nitely many    .in particular,the nite
subgroup g0 is called stabilizer of the group  if gx = x for g  g0  
and x hd+1 .the xed point(s) x could be either inside of hd+1 or at its
boundary rd . every discontinuous group is also discrete [52]. a group 
is discrete if there is no sequence n  i, n = 1, 2, ... with all n being
distinct.discretness implies that for any x  bd+1the orbit: x, 2x, 3x
accumulates only at sd

 ,e.g.see refs[10],[52],[53].

an orbit which has precisely one xed point on sd

 is being associated
with the parabolic subgroup elements of  while an orbit which has two xed
points on sd
 is being associated with the hyperbolic subgroup elements of
 .some important physical applications of these denitions associated with
thurstons theory of measured foliations and laminations had been recently
discussed in refs[27],[28] in connection with description of dynamics of 2+1
gravity and disclinations in liquid crystals.

there are also elliptic transformations but their xed points always
lie inside of bd+1and,therefore, are not of immediate physical interest.the
parabolic transformations are conjugate to translations t:x  x + 1(in the
hd+1 model these motions are motions in rd which leave the time axis
z unchanged ).the hyperbolic transformations are conjugate to dilatations

18

d:x  kx with k > 0 and k 6= 1,while the elliptic transformations are
conjugate to rotations r: x  eix about the origin .

 or  is nowhere dense in sd

the question arises: how to describe the limit set  of xed points which
belong to sd
? first, it is clear that ,by construction,  is closed set since
for all x  bd+1the orbit {x}   .second, it can be shown [53] that 
may either contain no more than two points (elementary set) or uncount-
able number of points (non- elementary set ).
in the last case either
 = sd
. mobius (or kleinian) groups for
which  = sd
 are known as mobius (or kleinian) groups of the rst kind
while mobius (or kleinian) groups for which  6= sd
 are known as groups
of the second kind.the main goal of the subsequent discussion is to pro-
vide enough evidence to the fact that the greens function for the hyperbolic
laplacian,eq.(3.6), exist if and only if the mobius group  is of the sec-
ond kind and this implies that the correlation function exponent,e.g. see
eq.(4.16),is associated with the hausdor dimension of the limit set  which
thus forms a fractal.

let us begin with the fundamental property of the hyperbolic laplacian
expressed in eq.s (3.13a) and (3.13b).this property implies that in the hyper-
bolic space bd+1the dirichlet (or plateau) problem can be considered only
in conjunction with the group of motions (isometries) in this space.in par-
ticular, let us consider an analogue of the poisson formula, eq.(2.14),for the
hyperbolic bd+1 model. we have,

(x) =

1

d zs d



|x  x|2!d
d(x)  1  |x|2

0(x)

(5.2)

where d is the areal measure of sd
. consider now a special case of eq.(5.2)
is
when 0(x) = const. then,evidently,(x) = const too since the r.h.s.
constant by requirement of normalization as it was discussed in section 3.
this means ,in turn,that eq.(4.16) does not exist for 0(x) = const. assume
now that 0(x) is given by (x) with (x) being the characterristic function
of the set   sd
. let us assume furthermore ,in accord with denitioins
provided earlier,that (x) = (x) (since the set  is closed) with   
.then,using eq.(5.2) we obtain,

(x) =

1

d zs d



d(x)  1  |x|2

|x  x|2!d

|(x)|d (x) .

(5.3)

19

but ,since it is known [17] that

1  |x|2 = |(x)| (1  |x|2)

and

|x  x|2 = |(x)| |(x)| |x  x|2

where (x) = d

dx , we obtain,

(x) =

that is

|x  x|2!d
d(x)  1  |x|2

(x) .

1

d zs d



(x) = (x).

(5.4)

(5.5)

this means, that the function (x) is authomorphic. since the poisson ker-
nel, in eq.(5.4), is related to the corresponding poisson kernel,eq.(3.14), in
hd+1 model, and ,therefore, is related to the eigenfunction zd of the hyperbolic
laplacian dened by eq.s (3.7),(3.8),we conclude ,that (x) is hyperharmonic
and is nonconstant. this however,cannot be the case for any nonzero areal
measure ,i.e. (x)d 6= 0 . to understand why this is so several facts from
the theory of fractals are helpful at this point.following mandelbot[54],let
us recall the olbers paradox.consider an observer in at euclidean universe
(which is assumed to be 3 dimensional) located at some xed point chosen
as an origin. the amount of light reaching an observer coming from some
star located at distance r is known to scale as r2 .at the same time,if
the density of stars is roughly uniform,then the total mass of stars in the
spherical volume of radius r is  r3 so that the number of stars located
at the visual sphere of radius r is  r2 and,therefore,the amount of light
coming to observer is of order  r2  r2 = const. that is the sky in such
euclidean universe is uniformly lit day and night.this is,of course,not true.
the resolution of this paradox can be reached if one assumes that the distri-
bution of stars is that characteristic for fractals with the total mass of stars
on the visual sphere being  rd where the fractal dimension d < 2.that
this is indeed the case was demonstrated by sullivan[55] (and,independently,
by tukia[56]) based on earlier work by thurston[33] provided, that our uni-
verse is not euclidean but hyperbolic. both thurston and sullivan were

20

not concerned with olbers paradox but rather with the fractal dimension of
the limit set  which is located at the sphere at innity s2
 in b2+1model
of the hyperbolic space. using intuitive terminology ,their results could be
stated as follows.

let b0 be some small ball located inside the hyperbolic space b3 at
some point a  b3 .let the noneuclidean radius  of b0be so small that the
images of b0 given by b0, 2b0, ....,   , do not overlap. instead of balls
consider now their shadows on s2
(as if inside of b0 there is a source of
light which illuminates b3 universe). denote b0 = b1, ..., nb0 = bn,etc.
,and accordingly,for shadows, b 
i so that the

2, ..., b 

1, b 

b 

n ,....let now l=si

areal measure   m(l).

the thurston- ahlfors theorem [17] can now be informally stated as

follows.

if

m(b 

i) < ,



pi=0

m(l) = 0

and vice versa.

then,
the above is possible only if some of the shadows of the balls bi lie
completely (or partially) inside the shadows of other balls (located closer
to b0).the hard part of the proof of this theorem lies precisely in proving
that this is the case.we are not going to reproduce the details of the proof in
this paper(the reader is urged to consult refs[17],[23]section 9.9, for elegant
and detailed proofs)rather, we would like to state the same results in more
precise terms.this can be done by noticing that ,if

then the poincare series (e.g.see eq.(4.19)) converges,that is

z d(x)(x) = 0,

exp{(x, x)} < 

x

and vice versa.or,equivalently,if

with d being given by eq.(3.18),then

z d(x)(x) = d

exp{(x, x)} =  .

figure 1: some geometric relations in the hyperbolic ball model

let us explain the obtained results in more physically familiar terms first,
in view of the results of section 4,it is clear,that the results obtained above
could be equivalently stated in terms of recurrence(transience) of random
walks.next,let us examine closer the poisson kernel in eq.(5.2),that is

p 

|x  x|2!
h(x, x) =  1  |x|2

(5.10)

where we had replaced d in eq.(5.2) by  for reasons which will become clear
shortly below.notice,that x  sd
 while x  bd+1 in eq.(5.10).consider the
 and passing through point x  bd+1as depicted
horoball centered at x  sd
in fig.1

using the cosine theorem for the angle xox in the triangle xox we obtain

|x|2 + 1  2 |x| cos(xox) = |x  x|2 .

(5.11)

alternatively,by using the triangle xoc we get

w +

|x|2 +(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(1  w)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

cos(xox) =

(1  |w|)2

(5.12)

22

by eliminating cos(xox) from these two equations we obtain,

1 + |x|2  |x  x|2

2

= 1 +

|x|2  1
1 + |w|

.

this result can be equivalently rewritten as

1  |w|
1 + |w|

=

|x  x|2
|x|2  1

.

the hyperbolic distance (0, w) is known to be [52]

(0, w) = ln(cid:18) 1 + |w|

1  |w|(cid:19) .

(5.13)

(5.14)

(5.15)

accordingly, the poisson kernel,eq.(5.12), can be equivalently rewritten as

ph(x, x) = exp{(0, w)}.

(5.16)

the hyperbolic fourier transform can be dened now as [57]

(x) =

1

d zs d



d(x) exp{ < x, x >} (x)

(5.17)

with scalar product < x, x > being dened through the hyperbolic distance
(0, w) according to eq.s (5.14),(5.15).

with help of the results just obtained it is possible to give better inter-
pretation of the ahlfors-thurston theorem.indeed, in view of eq.s(5.3)-(5.5)
we obtain,

(0) =

1

d xzs d



|(0)  x|2!d
d(x)  1  |(0)|2

(x)

(5.18)

where ,without loss of generality, we had put x=0 (i.e.placed the initial point
x at the center of bd+1) .surely,|(0)  x|2  4 since we are dealing with the
ball of unit radius.therefore,we also have

(0) <

1

dxzs d



d(x)(1  |(0)|2)d(x) .

(5.19)

23

consider now the convergence(or divergence) of the series

or,more generally,

(1  |(0)|2)d

sd =x

(1  |(0)|2) .

s =x

(5.20)

(5.21)

clearly,the last expression is going to be divergent or convergent along with

1 + |(0)|(cid:19)
g(0, 0) =x(cid:18) 1  |(0)|

=x

exp{(0, (0))}

(5.22)

in view of eq.s (5.15) and (4.19).but the convergence(divergence) of the
poincare series ,eq.(5.22),leads us to the results given by eq.s(5.6)-(5.9).
and also earlier stated result , eq.(4.19).

the results just obtained admit yet another interpretation. convergence
(or divergence) of the series,eq.(5.22) is associated with existence or nonex-
istence of the greens function acting in bd+1.deep results of ahlfors[17]
,thurston[33] ,patterson[31] ,beardon[58] and sullivan [32] state that if the
poincare series converges, then the greens function in bd+1 exist and the
limit set   sd
 is fractal with areal measure equal to zero but hausdorf f
dimension equal to  (in this case  lies at the border between the conveg-
ence and divergence of the series ,eq.(5.22),and for d=2 ,  2 according to
sullivan[55] and tukia[56] . additional very important results related to the
limit set  were obtained by beardon and maskit[10] who had proved the
following

theorem 5.1.(beardon maskit).let  be a discrete m obius group of
isometries of h 3, then, if  is geometrically nite, the limit set  com-
prizes of parabolic limit points and conical limit points .

we would like now to explain the physical signicance and the meaning of
these statements.first, by looking at eq.s(4.12)and (4.16) we conclude that
m2  0 (because of the results of sullivan and tukia). second,for the group
 to be geometrically nite (in b3) it is required that the fundamental
domain for  is being made of nite sided polyhedron p in b3 (just like for
the riemann surface of nite genus we should have a nite sided polygon in
the unit disk d whose boundary at innity is s1
).every hyperbolic manifold

24

m3 is dened through use of some fundamental polyhedron p so that ,in fact
[33],

m 3 = (b3  )/

(5.23)

where  = s2
   is the open set of discontinuity of  . in general,  repre-
sents some collection of riemann surfaces which belong to the boundary of
m 3.this fact has some relevance to problems associated with 2+1 gravity as
explained in ref.[27],[28].the boundary set  is not accessible dynamically
however since it is a complement of the limit set  in s2
.based in the infor-
mation provided, study of the hyperbolic 3-manifolds is equivalent to study of
the action of discrete subroups  of the mobius group g on h3(or b3).in par-
ticular,if the quotient ,eq.(5.23),is compact,then  is said to be cocompact
and if the quotient ,eq.(5.23), has nite invariant volume,then  is said to be
conite. incidentally, if  contains parabolic subgroups,then  is not cocom-
pact. as it was shown by thurston[33](for some illustrations,please,see also
ref.[59]) complements of most of knots embedded in s3are associated with
the hyperbolic 3-manifolds. accordingly, if conformal eld theories are to
be associated with knots/links (e.g.see refs[3],[5],[6]),then the corresponding
complements of such knots/links should be associated with the hyperbolic 3-
manifolds.moreover,the spectral characteristics of dierent hyperbolic mani-
folds should be dierent as well.[19] .this dierence should be also connected
with dierence in fractal dimensions of the corresponding limit sets which, in
turn,will correspond to dierent type (universality classes)of the conformal
eld theories.conversely, given the fractal dimension of the limit set  , is it
possible to determine the kleinian (or mobius )group (or groups) which is
associated with this limit set ? evidently,this problem is more complicated
than the direct one. nevertheless, the above discussion is not limited to h3 (
or b3) and ,therefore, it becomes potentially possible to study and to classify
boundary conformal eld theories in dimensions higher than two. more on
this subject is presented in sections 7 and 8.

let us now give the precise denitions of parabolic and conical limit
points which were mentioned in the theorem by beardon and maskit stated
above.an extensive discussion of both parabolic and conical limit points (and
sets) could be found in ref.[60] .from this reference we nd that for any
discrete group the set of bounded parabolic points and the set of conical limit
points are disjoint. given this, and recalling that the parabolic transfor-
mations are associated with translations we are left with the following two

25

figure 2: a typical z-cusp in the upper half space model realization of h3

options(in case of h3) :a)either the parabolic subgroup has just one generator
of translations so that the fundamental polyhedron is the region between
two parallel planes as depicted in fig.2.

such construction is called rank 1 ( or z- cusp). evidently,topologically
motion  to these planes is the same as motion on the circle s1 as it was
recently discussed at some length in ref[59]in connection with some problems
in polymer physics.accordingly, such parabolic subgroup is isomorphic to z
.b)or the parabolic subgroup has two generators so that the fundamental
polyhedron is the region dened by the transverse pairs of parallel planes
,as depicted in fig.3

such construction is called rank 2 ( or zz ) cusp.topologically, motion
 to such planes is being associated with the motion on the torus. the
restriction to have only z and zz cusps for hyperbolic 3-manifolds imposes
very important restrictions on the boundary conformal eld theories to be
discussed in section 7.

the conical limit set is not specic to the hyperbolic spaces . according
to ref.[30],in the case of euclidean half-space hn for which the typical point

26

figure 3: a typical zz type cusp in the upper half space realization of h3

y=(x,z),z>0,x rn1,the conical limit set (a) is dened through

(a) = {(x, z)  hn : |x  a| < z}.

(5.24)

geometrically, (a) is a cone as depicted in fig.4.with vertex a and axis of
symmetry parallel to z-axis.

a function u dened on hn is said to have nontangential limit l at
a  rn1 if for every  > 0, u(y)  l as y  a within (a).the term
nontangential is being used because no curve in (a) that approaches a
can be tangent to hn = rn1.it is quite remarkable that such nontangential
behavior is being observed already for harmonic functions on euclidean half-
space hn.[30] .use of stereographic projection allows us to formulate the
same problem in euclidean ball bn.respectively,exactly the same denitions
are extended to hd+1 and bd+1.specically,in the case of bd+1 model one can
say that x  bd+1 belongs to the cone at   sd
 of opening  and ,further,
|x  | < 2 cos  . analogously to eq. (5.24) one can write

|x  | < (1  |x|),  > 0.

(5.25)

obtained results allow us to discuss in some detail the spectral theory of
hyperbolic 3-manifolds. this is accomplished in the next section.

vi. spectral theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds

in section 3 we had discussed the eigenvalue equation ,eq.(3.7), so that
,naively, one might think that this equation provides a complete answer to
the question about the spectrum of hyperbolic laplacian .this is not true
however. surprisingly,this problem still remains a very active area of research
in mathematics. for a comprehensive and very up to date introduction to
this eld ,please,consult ref[19].the fact that the spectral theory of hyper-
bolic laplacians is absolutely essential for understanding of the spectrum
of hausdor dimensions of the limit set  was realized already by patter-
son[61] long time ago.since, even now, the spectrum issue is not completely
settled,we would like only to give an outline of the current situation leaving
most of the details for future work.

in his 1987 paper[62] sullivan had stated the theorem (2.17)(numeration
taken from his work)which he calls the patterson-elstrodt theorem( inciden-
tally, the recent monograph, ref[19], is written by elstrodt ). based on the
results of previous sections it can be formulated as follows:

28

theorem 6.1.(patterson-elstrodt-sullivan).
let

h = 

(6.1)

be the eigenvalue problem for the hyperbolic laplacian on m d = h d+1/
then,the lowest eigenvalue 0(m d) satises

0(m d) =(cid:26)

d2
4 if

  d
2

()(()  d) if   d
2

(6.2)

where () is the critical exponent of the poincar e series, eq.(4.19) or
eq.(5.22).

by looking at eqs.(4.11),(4.12) ,these results can be restated as

m2 =(cid:26) 0 if   d

4 if   d

 d2

2

2

(6.3)

additional work by patterson[63] indicates that, at least for m 3,0 <   2.
in view of this ,by looking at eq. (4.12), it is reasonable to consider both
+ and - branches of solution for  ,provided that  d2
4 < m2  0. this
possibility ,indeed ,had been recognized in ref.[64].the results obtained by
lax and phillips[65] (and also by epstein[66]) indicate that for 3-manifolds
without parabolic cusps the spectrum of -h acting on l(m 3) normed
metric hilbert space is of the form:

{0, ..., k}  [

d2
4

, )

where

0 < (d  ) = 0 < 1 < ... < k <

d2
4

(6.4)

(6.5)

are eigenvalues of nite multiplicity and 0 has multiplicity one. more-
over,the part of spectrum [ d2
4 , ) is absolutely continuous (i.e.for m2 
 d2
the spectrum is continuous).the problem with lax-phillips[65] and
4
epstein[66] works lies ,however,in the fact that the explicit form of the dis-
crete spectrum had not been obtained. only the existence of such possibility
had been proven.

29

remark 6.2.in view of beardon-maskit theorem (section5) one cannot
by pass careful study of the spectrum of hyperbolic laplacian for some dis-
crete subgroups  of mobius group g if one is interested in nding the correct
fractal dimension of the limit set  .

if we would choose the sign - in eq.

for the sake of applications to statistical mechanics (e.g.see section 7)
one is also interested in spectral properties of 3-manifolds with parabolic
cusps.this can be intuitively understood already now based on the following
arguments.
(4.12) (which,by the
way would produce + sign in front of eq. (4.16),then for m2 in the range
 d2
4  m2 < 0 we would have  in the range 0 <   1 for d=2.this range
is of interest since it covers all physically interesting conformal eld theories
discussed in the literature[9].if  is to be associated with the hausdor di-
mension of the limit set , then according to sullivan ,e.g.see theorem 2 of
ref.[55],only 3 manifolds with no cusps or rank 1 (fig.2) cusps will yield 
in the desired range.the spectral theory of hyperbolic manifolds with cusps
is still under active development in mathematics[20].therefore,we would like
to restrict ourself with some qualitative estimates of the spectrum based on
topological arguments.here and below we shall discuss only the case d=2
(i.e.h3 or b3). this restriction is by no means severe. it is motivated only
by the fact that more explicit analytical results are available for this case in
mathematical literature.this ,however,does not imply that the case d=2 is
more special than say d=3.for instance, burger and canary [67] had demon-
strated that for any d>1the hausdor dimension  is bounded by

  (d  1) 

kd

(d  1)vol(c(m d))2

(6.6)

where kd and c(m d) are some d-dependent constants which can be calcu-
lated in principle .

in the case if hyperbolic manifold m 3 is topologically tame (that is it is
homeomorphic to the interior of a compact 3 manifold) ,then theorem 2.1.
of canary et all [68] states that

theorem 6.3.(canary ,minsky and taylor) if m 3 is topologically tame
hyperbolic 3-manifold,then the lowest eigenvalue 0 of the hyperbolic lapla-
cian (-h) is given by 0 = (2 ) unless  < 1,in which case 0(m 3) = 1.
remark 6.4 as before , is the hausdor dimension of the limit set .
remark 6.5 from the above theorem 6.3.
it appears that the results
of section 4 become invalid when  < 1since eq.(4.12) cannot be used. the

30

situation can be easily repaired as it is explained in the next section.

remark 6.6.theorem 6.3. allows us to obtain the following additional

estimates based on recent results by bishop and jones[34].

theorem 6.7.(bishop and jones). let  be any discrete m obius group

and let m 3 = (b3)/ . suppose that the lowest eigenvalue 0 is nonzero.then,
there are constants c <  and c > 0 (depending upon 0 only)so that for
any x,y with (x, y)  8 we have

g(x, y) =



z0

dtg(x, y; t) 

c
0

exp{c(x, y)}

(6.7)

where (x, y) is the hyperbolic distance between x and y and c=min{ 1

4 }.
corollary.6.8.using this result in combination with eqs.(4.18),(4.19)
and the theorem 6.3. we obtain,  = 0
8. if this result is substituted
into eq.(4.16) we obtain the exact result for two-point correlation function
for two dimensional ising model.

80, 1

8 = 1

remark 6.9.the theorem of bishop and jones depends crucially on the
explicit form for the heat kernel g(x, y; t) in h3. quite recently ,grigoriyan
and noguchi[69] had obtained explicit formulas for the heat kernel for any
dimension of hyperbolic space. this opens a possibility to obtain an analogue
of inequality (6.7) in any dimension following ideas of bishop and jones.

with all plausibility of the corollary 6.8. it remains to demonstrate that
such substitution of  into eq. (4.16) is indeed legitimate.to this purpose
we would like to provide a somewhat dierent interpretation of eq.(4.16) in
order to demonstrate that eq.(4.17) makes sense even without arguments as-
sociated with plateau/dirichlet problem.to begin,we would like ,by analogy
with the liouville theorem in standard textbooks on statistical mechanics,to
construct a measure associated with the geodesic ows in hyperbolic space.
following ref.[17] ,we would like to associate with each point x  bd+1 
b a unit vector   sdof directions. this vector plays the same role as veloc-
ity v in conventional statistical mechanics. indeed,v 6= 0 one can construct
a vector = v
|v| and then proceed with usual development. the mobius group
 is acting on the phase space t(b)=bs according to the rule

(x, ) (cid:18)x,

 (x)
| (x)|

(cid:19)   .

(6.8)

31

figure 5: geometry of geodesics in the ball model of hyperbolic space

the invariant phase space volume element d is given therefore by

d = dxhd()

(6.9)

with d() being a spatial angle measure and dxh being an element of a hy-
perbolic volume.the above chosen variables may not be the most convenient
ones.more convenient are variables associated with the actual location of the
ends of geodesics u and v on sd

.this situation is depicted in fig.5

it is clear,that x  b one can select a geodesic which passes through x.to
this purpose it is not sucient to assign u and v on sd
 but, in addition,one
has to provide a location (u, v) of the midpoint for such geodesics. let s be
the directional hyperbolic distance between  and x,then,one should be able
to nd a correspondence between (x,) and (u, v, s),that is one should be able
to nd a dieomorphism between b  s and s  s  r, i.e.one expects to
nd an explicit form of the function f (u, v) which enters into the expression
for the volume element given below:

d = dxhd() = f (u, v)d(v)d(u)ds

(6.10)

32

a simple argument given in ref[17] produces

f (u, v) =

g

|u  v|2d

(6.11)

with g being some normalization constant. looking now at eq. (3.22),it is
clear ,that one can now replace it with

d[] =z d

ds

0(u)0(v) .

(6.12)

it is also clear,in view of the transformation properties of the function 0given
by eq.(4.14),that ,in general,one can replace eq.(6.12) with

d[] = gz 0(u)0(v)

|u  v|2 d(v)d(u)

(6.13)

where the exponent  is associated with the hausdor dimension of the
limit set  .this is indeed the case, e.g.see page 286 of ref[53]. thus,the
exponent  in eq. (6.13) is the same as the exponent  in eq. (5.22). this
observation provides the necessary support to the claims made after eq.(6.7).
given all above, the obtained results show no apparent connections with
the existing conformal eld theories.we would like to correct this deciency
in the next two sections.

vii. connections with the existing formalism of con-

formal eld theories

in section 5 we had introduced z and zz cusps,e.g. see figs 2,3.accord-
ing to sullivan[55],only 3-manifolds with no cusps or just z-cusps will produce
limit sets  with hausdor dimension  in the range 0 <   1. naively,it
means ,that only consideration of the boundary conformal eld theories on
the strip with periodic boundary conditions(thus making it a cylinder) will
yield the critical exponents for two point correlation functions in the above
range.this case is indeed frequently discussed in physics literature[9].for the
strip of width l use of the conformal transformation

z = w(z) =

l
2

ln z

33

(7.1)

converts z strip of width l to z  c where c is the entire complex plane
{rigorously speaking ,we are dealing here with c\{0} complex plane[70]}.although
the above discussion appears to be plausible ,the description of z-cusps (as
well as zz cusps ) is actually considerably more sophisticated. in this pa-
per we only provide a brief outline of what is actually involved reserving full
treatment for future publications.

in section 5 we had noticed that  may contain no more than two limiting
points (elementary set) or innite number of points (non-elementary set).
the kleinian groups which are associated with the elementary limit sets are
known [8], [22] and,basically, are reducible to the following list:

1) a parabolic innite cyclic abelian group  : z  z + 1;
2) a parabolic rank 2 abelian group  : z  z + 1, z  z +  ; im  > 0;
3) a loxodromic cyclic group  : z z with   c\{0, 1}.
let now m 3 be some 3-manifold and let m(0,) be a subset of points
p  m 3 such that there is a closed nontrivial curve passing through p whose
hyperbolic length l is less than . then ,if  < 2r0 where r0 is some known
(margulis)constant,the m(0,) part of m 3 (the thin part) is a quotient h 3/
where  is just one of these three elementary groups. the complement
of m(0,) in m 3 is called thick part.the above construction is not lim-
ited to m 3and is applicable to any m d+1(with margulis constant being,of
course,dierent for dierent ds). the thin part is associated with z and
zz cusps.

remark 7.1.recently,we had briey considered the thick  -thin de-
composition of hyperbolic 3-manifolds in connection with dynamics of 2+1
gravity [27], [28].for a comprehensive mathematical treatment of these issues
,please,consult ref[33],.[60],[71].

to realize ,that the thin part is associated with z cusps it is sucient
in this case, the following

to look at h2 model of hyperbolic space rst.
theorem can be proven[72]

theorem 7.2.(farkas and kra) let g be fuchsian group operating on
h 2 .if g contains a parabolic element, then h 2/g contains a puncture.the
number of punctures is in one-to-one correspondence with the number of con-
jugacy classes of parabolic elements.

recall now, that in 3 dimensional case  = s2

   and,using eq.(5.27),
it is possible to show that / is just a collection of riemann surfaces.() . in
the case if we are dealing with z-cusps these surfaces will contain punctures
as it was rst noticed by ahlfors[73] .the number of cusps (=punctures) nc

34

is related to the number of generators n of the kleinian group acting on
h3.according to sullivan[74](and also abiko[75])

nc  3n-4

(7.2)

in the language of the conformal eld theories the punctures are usually
associated with the vertex operators[9].the presence of punctures converts
riemann surface r=/ into the marked riemann surface[18].we shall
, for simplicity, treat the quotient / as just one riemann surface (un-
less the otherwise is specied) keeping in mind that there could be nitely
many(ahlfors niteness theorem[73]) .among marked surfaces one can choose
some reference riemann surface x for which the marking is xed.then, other
surfaces could be related to x via homeomorphism f: r x sending the
orientation on r into orientation on x. the teichmuller space ,teich(r),
associates conformal structures on r in which each boundary component cor-
responds to a puncture.two marked surfaces (f1,r1) and (f2, r2) dene the
same point in teichmuller space teich(r) if there is a complex analytic
isomorphism i: r1  r2 such that if1 is homotopic to f2. two surfaces r1
and r2 belong to two dierent points in teichmuller space if the teichmuller
metric (distance)

d(r1, r2) =

1
2

inf ln k()

(7.3)

is greater than zero. here  : r1  r2 ranges over all quasiconformal
maps in the homotopy class f2f1
1 (relative to the punctures) so that k()
is maximum dilatation of .the above formula is not immediately useful
since we have not dened yet what is meant by dilatation.to correct this
deciency ,let us consider the beltrami coecient (for suggestive physical
interpretation,please,consult ref[28])

f =

zf (z)
zf (z)

(7.4)

for functions f1and f2 introduced above we obtain respectively 1 and 2.then,[22], [35]

k() =

1 + r
1  r

where r=(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

with k  k being dened by the requirement [35]

1  2

1  12(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)

(7.5)

(7.6)

kf (z)k = sup
zr

|f (z)| < 1

35

from the above results it follows,that if    and z s2

, then

and

((z))

(z)
(z)

= (z)

(z) = 0

z  .

(7.7)

(7.8)

let us now x  and introduce f(z) instead (that is f(z) is some function
which produces the beltrami coecient according to eq.(7.4)).the mapping
   given by  f    (f)1 is called quasiconformal (or  
conf ormal) deformation.let us notice now that normally the riemann sur-
face r is being dened as quotient r=h2/g where g is some discrete fuch-
sian group. in the case of s2
 we have a rather peculiar situation: kleinian
group   p sl2(c) plays the same role as fuchsian g p sl2(r).one
can bring these two together by noticing that h2 model corresponds to an
open disc d. then, one can glue two copies of d together thus forming s2
 .
kleinian group  acting on s2
 can be considered as fuchsian on each of these
two disks. the mapping    may aect the gluing boundary between
the two disks.. if we use f to produce new group from the old,i.e.,

 = f     (f )1,

(7.9)

then thus obtained new group is called quasi-fuchsian (provided that 
is fuchsian) if the gluing boundary between two disks is still topologically
a circle s1(e.g. see thurstons lecture notes[33] ,section 8.34). this gluing
boundary may include  as a part only or,it could be that  = s1.

recently,canary and taylor [37] had proved the following remarkable

theorem.

theorem 7.3.(canary and taylor). let  be nonelementary nitely
generated kleinian group and let  denote its limit set, then the hausdor
dimension  of  is less than one if  is geometrically nite and has a nite
index subgroup which is quasiconformally conjugate to a fuchsian group of
the second kind .

remark 7.4.recall[76] ,that for the fuchsian groups of the second kind
the limit points are nowhere dense on s1.since,according to section 6,we are
interested mainly in the domain given by 0 <   1,we notice that we
have to deal with the quasiconformal deformations of s1 associated with
fuchsian groups of the second kind.

36

for completeness,we would like also to provide the results related to the
fuchsian groups of the rst kind for which the limit set  coincides with
s1.these are summarized in the following

theorem 7.5.(canary and taylor[37]) let  be nonelementary geomet-
rically nite kleinian group, then either  has a nite index subgroup which
is quasiconformally conjugate to a fuchsian group of the second kind or 
contains a subgroup of index at most 2 which is a fuchsian group of the rst
kind. in the last case the hausdor dimension of  is equal to one.

remark 7.6.much earlier bowen[77] had proven an analogous theorem
for the fuchsian groups of the rst kind. according to bowen, the hausdor
dimension of  is greater than one.since bowens proof is nonconstructive,
there is no way to estimate ,based on his results ,to what extent  is larger
than one.thus,there is no contradiction between theorem 7.3. and bowens
results since  can be innitesimally close to 1.

remark 7.7.for the case of fuchsian groups of the rst kind bers had
demonstrated [78] that / consists of exactly two riemann surfaces :one
for each disk d. bers had also demonstrated[36] that for the fuchsian group
of the second kind / is made of just one riemann surface so that s2
 is
boundary at innity for this surface.

in mathematics literature[22] a nitely generated non elementary kleinian
group which has just one invariant component  is called function group.
if , in addition , is simply connected, then such group is called b-group.
more complicated kleinian groups could be constructed from simpler ones
and b-group is one of the main building blocks in such construction[79].

remark 7.8.in string theory (and ,therefore,in the conformal eld the-
ory)the schottky-type groups are being used[80] .schottky group is a function
group but not a b-group [22].

remark 7.9.any nitely generated kleinian group  of the second kind

is a function group ,e.g. see ref.[22] (page 126).

remark 7.10 there is one-to one correspondence between the quasi-
conformal deformations of kleinian groups and quasisometric deformations
of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.the theory is not limited to 3-manifolds ,however,
and can be considered for any d 2. more specically ,there is a
theorem 7.11.for a quasiconformal automorphism f of s2

 compatible
with a kleinian group  ,there exist a quasi-isometric automorphism f of h 3
which is an extension of f and which is compatible with  ,namely, f f 
mob(b3) for any   .

37

proof: please,consult ref.[22] (page 157).(cid:3)
remark 7.12.the above theorem follows directly from the discussion re-

lated to eq.s (7.7)(7.9) and for additional details and motivations,please,consult
the work by bers[36].

remark 7.13.the above theorem is applicable to the case when,instead
,we use s1
(taking into account the results on canary and taylor ,the-

of s2
orems 7.3 and 7.5)

the observations presented above allow us to make a direct connection
with the existing results associated with 2 dimensional conformal eld the-
ories.to begin,let us notice that if we would have s1
 as limit set  for the
fuchsian groups of the rst kind, then, according to eq. (7.8) we could not
use the quasiconformal mapping and ,accordingly,we would be stuck with
just one conformal structure.this fact is known in mathematics as mostow
rigidity theorem.usually, this theorem is applied to spaces of dimensionality
 3 (for more details,please,see section 8).at the same time,if we consider
fuchsian groups of the second kind,then ,we need to deal with maps of s1

acting on some open intervals (since  is closed set) of s1
. this is not
exactly the situation which is known in physics literature.indeed,in physics
literature on conformal eld theories one is dealing with the virasoro alge-
bra. let us recall how one can arrive at this algebra.following ref.[48],let us
consider the group g=dif f s1 of orientation preserving dieomorphisms of
s1
.let 1(z) and 2(z) be two elements of g ,then the group composition
law can be dened by

1  2(z) = 1(2(z))

, z = exp{i}

(7.10)

the representation of the group g is dened now according to the following
prescription:

u()f (z) = f (1(z)),

(7.11)

where the operator () acts on the vector space of smooth complex-valued
functions on s1
.the explicit form of the operator () can be easily found
if one notices that

(z) = z(1 + (z)) = z +



xn=

nzn+1, n  0+.

(7.12)

38

using this expansion and keeping only terms up to 1st order in n we obtain,

u()f (z) = f (z 



xn=

nzn+1) = (1 +xn

n

dn)f (z)

(7.13)

with operator dn given by

dn = zn+1 d
dz

= i exp{in}

d
d

.

(7.14)

the operators dn form a closed lie algebra v ects1 described in terms of the
following commutator

h dm, dni = (m  n) dmn

(7.15)

the central extension of this algebra (to be discussed later in this section)
produces the virasoro algebra. v ects1contains a closed subalgebra formed
by d0, d1 and d1 corresponding to the innitesimal conformal transforma-
tions of the extended complex plane s2=c  {} caused by the action of
psl2(c).thus, even though we had started with dieomorphisms of the cir-
cle,we ended up with the automorphisms of the extended complex plane. the
question arises: is such extension unique ? the answer is: no ! because of
this negative answer ,there is a real possibility of extension of the operator
formalism of 2d conformal eld theories to higher dimensions.this issue is
going to be discussed in the next section.for the time being,we would like to
explain the reasons why the answer is no.

following ahlfors[81] ,and ,more recently,gardiner and sullivan[82],we
would like to consider a quasisymmetric mapping (to be dened below) of
the disk d to itself which induces a topological mapping of the circumference
, i.e. s1
. to this purpose it is convenient to use a conformal transformation
which converts the disk model to the upper halfplane poincare model of the
hyperbolic space h2.next, it is convenient to select points x,x-t, and x+t on
the real line r (corresponding to s1
) so that the mapping h(x) satises the
m-condition

m 1 

h(x + t)  h(t)
h(x)  h(x  t)

 m

(7.16)

let h be a homeomorphism mapping of an open intrerval i of the real axis
into the real axis. then, h is quasisymmetric on i if there exist a constant

39

m such that the inequality (7.16) is satised for all x-t, x, x+t in i. thus
dened quasisymmetric mapping forms a group(which we shall denote as qs)
which obeys the same composition law as given by eq.(7.10)(except now z
is on the real line).the real line r is the universal covering of the circle. the
exponential mapping ,exp (2i), induces an isomorphism between r/z and
s1. the homeomorphism h(x) of s1which is characterized by the properties
[82]

h(0) = 0, h(x) + 1 = h(x + 1)

can be lifted to a homeomorphism h(x) of r which obeys the following in-
equalities:

1  (t) 

h(x + t)  h(x)
h(x)  h(x  t)

 1 + (t)

(7.17)

where  converges to zero with t.

it is easy to check that this result is consistent with eq.(7.12) and ,there-
fore, the group g is called the group of symmetric homeomorphisms. g is
proper subgroup of qs[82].looking at eq.(7.5) and identifying r with (t)we
conclude ,that the subgroup g has boundary dilatation asymptotically equal
to one . that is such transformation do not cause the deformations of hy-
perbolic 3-manifolds .the above deciency of the group g was recognized
and corrected in fundamental work by nag and verjovsky [39]. below ,we
would like to provide the summary of their accomplishments in the light of
results just described and with purpose of extension of these results in section
8.in order to do so, we still need to make several observations related to qs
group. let us begin with

theorem 7.14.(ahlfors-beurling[83]) assume h is homeomorphism of r
.then,h is quasisymmetric if ,and only if , there exists a quasiconformal ex-
tension h of h to the complex plane . if h is normalized to x three points,say
0,1 and ,then h is quasisymmetric with constant m. the quasiconformal
extension h can be selected so that its dilatation k is less than or equal to
c1(m) where c1(m)  1 as m  1.

remark 7.15. the symmetric homeomorphism (z) by contrast xes
only one point: z=0. some explicit examples of construction of h are given
in the papes by carleson[84] and agard and kelingos [85].

remark 7.16.because c1(m)  1 when m 1 any symmetric homeo-
morphism of s1 can be approximated by quasisymmetric one. this is the

40

most important fact facilitating development of conformal eld the-
ories beyond 2 dimensions.

construction of h is closely related to study of maps of the circle as it is
known in the theory of dynamical systems[86].evidently,one is interested in
maps which map points   to points in  and (or) ,alternatively,maps which
map points in  to points in .notice,that under such conditions the lie
algebra v ects1can always be constructed since its construction requires only
existence of some open interval around any point z .but,by denition,the
set  is open.

let us discuss now the issue of central extension of v ects1.the need
to introduce the central extension of the lie algebra v ects1 is by no means
intrinsic just for this group. already schur developed general method of con-
structing projective representations of nite groups about a hundred years
ago .the extension of his method to lie groups is relatively straightforward
and is wonderfully presented in the book by hamermesh[87]. the compre-
hensive up to date summary of results in this direction could be found in
the encyclopedic work, ref[88]. it is not our purpose to provide a review of
these results. we would like here to explain the physical motivations leading
to the projective representations of lie groups since the central extension is
directly related to construction of these projective representations.

as is well known, there are actually two dierent ways to solve quantum
mechanical problems. the rst one comes from mathematics of solving of
2nd order ordinary dierential equations while the second one comes from the
algebraic (group-theoretic) approach to the same problem. the projective
representations are naturally associated with the second approach.in partic-
ular,let g1 and g2 be two elements of some lie group g. one can think of
unitary representations associated with group g. that is one can try to nd
a unitary operator u(g), g  g, such that

u(g1)u(g2) = u(g1  g2)

(7.18)

such representation of the group g is called vector representation(by anal-
ogy with nite dimensional space where the role of u is being played by nite
matrices acting on vectors).
in quantum mechanics ,as is well known,the
wave function is determined with accuracy up to phase factor. this means
that,along with eq.(7.18),one can think of alternative way of writing the
composition law,e.g.

u(g1)u(g2) = (g1, g2)u(g1  g2)

(7.19)

41

surely,one should require |(g1, g2)| = 1.this then allows us to write the
factor (g1, g2) as

(g1, g2) = exp{i(g1, g2)}

(7.20)

the phase factor (g1, g2) is associated with the topology of the underlying
group space. finally,in our case of dif f s1 the action of the operator u(g)
on the vector f (z) is given by eq.s(7.11)-(7.13) so that the composition law
,eq.(7.19), along with denition ,eq.(7.20), allows us to obtain in a rather
standard way[89] the centrally extended lie algebra v ects1 which is known
as virasoro algebra and it is given by

h dm, dni = (m  n) dmn + ca(m, n)

(7.21)

where c is some number (related to the central charge) and the two-cocycle
a(m, n) is related to (g1, g2) and can be easily obtained explicitly by using
the jacoby identity and the commutation relations given by eq.(7.21).. the
nal result can be written in the form suggested by kac[48]

h dm, dni = (m  n) dmn + m,n

(m3  n)

12

c

(7.22)

with c being the central charge.for the developments presented below in
this paper it is very important to recognize the physical reason for the
emergence of the two-cocycle a(m,n). nag and verjovsky[39] had demon-
strated that it is related to the quasisymmetric deformations of the projective
structures on s1by dieomorphisms. these structures were fully classied in
ref[90].basically, they are associated with group of mobius transformatoions
psl(2,r)

x =

ax + b
cx + d

(7.23)

on the real line.study of the deformations of the projective structure on the
line which was initiated by ahlfors and beurling[85] was considerably devel-
oped by carleson[86] and agard and kelingos[87] and culminated in the work
of nag and verjovsky[39] . to make our presentation self-contained we would
like now to summarize their results from the point of view of ideas presented
in this section.this summary is needed whenever one is contemplating about

42

the extension of existing 2 dimensional results related to conformal eld theo-
ries to higher dimensions (to be discussed in some detail in the next section).
consider a quotient t(1)=qs/psl(2,r) that is the space of true qua-
say ,1,-1 and -i on s1
sisymmetric deformations which x 3 points,e.g.
, then t(1) is associated with universal teichmuller space in a sense of
bers[91].the space m = dif f s1/p sl(2, r) is embeddable inside of t(1).the
space m can be equipped with the complex structure so that it becomes in-
vm dm and w =
wm dm tangent to m at some point chosen as the origin one can construct

nite dimensional kahler manifold.for the vectors v = pm
pm

the kahler metric g(v, w). the most spectacular result of ref [39] lies in the
proof of the fact that the kahler 2-form

(v, w) = g(v, jw)

(7.24)

vnwma(m, n) with a(m, n, ) being the same as in eq.(7.21),

where (v, w) = pn,m

(7.22) and jw being dened through equation

the quotient /f a riemann surface.in the present case f 1 as it will be
explained shortly. in view of this, one should not worry about f.

remark 7.17.a)the kalerity of w-p metric expressed by eq.(7.24) had
actually been proven by ahlfors[40] in 1961.b) in the same paper by ahlfors
, eq.(7.28) was derived which diers in sign and numerical prefactor from
eq.(7.28).this, fortunately, plays no role in the nal results obtained in
ref[39].

remark 7.18 since eq.(7.28) plays the central role in the rest of calcu-
lations presented below,we would like to provide some additional information
related to this equation(not contained in ref[39]).to this purpose let f in
eq. (7.4) be written as (t)(z) = t(z).then, it can be shown [35] that for
solution f  of the beltrami eq.(7.4) the following limiting result holds

with help of eq.(7.29) we obtain,

to be compared with eq.(7.12).from this comparison it follows, that the
quasisymmetric vector eld v on s1 can be dened as

where the use was made of eq.(7.29).obtained result is documented on p.138
of ahlfors book, ref[81],and should be compared against eq.(7.28).since it is
well known[35] that the schwarzian derivative acts like a quadratic dierential
under the transformations which belong to the fuchsian group f ,we conclude
that,indeed,up to unimportant constant (which may dier from  
12 when the
transformation from h2 to  is made )eqs.(7.28) and (7.37) are equivalent.

next,by combining eqs.(7.21),(7.24),(7.25) it can be shown ,that

g(v, w) = 2ic re

that

b

thus we have shown, following nag and verjovsky[39],that the central
charge of the virasoro algebra is directly associated with the qua-
sisymmetric deformations of  (or h2).in view of this fact ,it becomes
possible to consider extensions of the existing formalism to higher dimen-
sions. this is the subject of the next section.

viii. beyond two dimensions

in 1968 mostow[92]had proven a very important theorem which is known

as mostow rigidity theorem. it can be formulated as follows.

theorem 8.1.(mostow)let n=h d+1/ be a complete hyperbolic manifold
, d  2, and let n  =h d+1/ be some other hyperbolic manifold, then if there
is a quasi-isometric homeomorphism f: n n  ,then f is homotopic to an
isometry n n  if and only if both mobius groups  and  are of the rst
kind (i.e.  = sd

   = 0,e.g. see section 5).

remark 8.2.this result could be easily understood in view of eq.s (7.7)
and (7.8). for an additional illustration of the existing possibilities one is en-
couraged to look at the paper by donaldson and sullivan[93] who established

46

that some closed four-manifolds have innitely many distinct quasiconformal
structures while others do not admit the quasiconformal structure at all.

remark 8.3.mostow rigidity theorem can be viewed as an extension
and ramication of much earlier theorem by liouville (originally proven in
1850)[94] which can be stated as follows.let u be some open subset of rd 
{}  rd and let f:u  rd be a conformal map,then f is just a mobius
transformation for d 3. it is because of this theorem , known in physical
literature[9]there is a widespread belief that the results of two dimensional
conformal eld theories cannot be extended to higher dimensions.

remark 8.4 in order to study d dimensional systems at criticality (d 2)
one should look for the mobius groups of the second kind .then, the ques-
tion arises immediatly :is there an analogue of physically funadamentally
important canary-taylor theorems (theorems 7.2. and 7.3) in higher dimen-
sions? we are unaware of a comprehensive answer to this question. how-
ever,we would like to mention the fundamental papers of gromov,lawson and
thurston[95] and kuiper[96] from which it follows that ,at least for groups
of isometries of h4 considered in these references ,the limit set is a circle
s1(actually,nowhere dierentiable julia-like set).

in view of the above lack of canary-taylor theorems in higher dimen-
sions,we would like to discuss now dierent methods of study the limit
sets (and their complements)of mobius groups in dimensions higher than
3.to this purpose ,using eqs (5.2)-(5.5) and following mcmullen[18](and
thurston[33],chapter 11) we dene the map :

av : c (sd

, r)  c (hd+1, r)

or

f (0)  av(f )(0) =

1

d zs d

d(x)f (x)

(8.1)

47

i.e. the map av(f) is the average of f over sd

. using eqs.(5.2),(5.5) we obtain:

f (y) = f (0) =

1

dzs d

d(x)f (x)

(8.2)

=

=

=

d zs d

y(x)(cid:12)(cid:12)
|x  y|2!d
d(x)  1  |y|2

f (x)

= av(f )(0)

here yhd+1,t10 = y.

using eq.s (2.14),(3.7),(3.8),(3.15) and (5.2) we conclude that

hav(f )(0) = 0.

(8.3)

that is the avarage av(f ) is a harmonic function in hyperbolic metric.it is
clear, that to restore the harmonic function f (x) in hd+1 it is sucient to
know the function f (x) at the boundary of hyperbolic space, i.e. on sd

.

let now v(x) be some vector eld,v(x)  sd

.then,as before,one can

extend it to the bulk of hyperbolic space by using the prescription:

av(v)(0) =

1

dzs d

d(x)v(x)

(8.4)

in the case of functions, av(f ) by design provides a continuous function on
sd
hd+1.this is not true for vectors (or tensors in general).in the case of
vectors ,one denes the extension operator ex(f ) via the following prescrip-
tion:

ex(f ) = av(f ) for scalar elds(functions)

(8.5)

ex(v) =

d + 1

2d

av(v)

for vector elds,etc.

(8.6)

48

being armed with these results we are ready to extend the results of previous
section to higher dimensions.to this purpose,we need to reanalyze eq.(7.29)
rst.it is equation for the vector eld which is created by deformation ().it
can be shown,,e.g.see pages 196-197 of ref[35], that


 z

v[](z) = (z)

(8.7)

that is when (z) = 0, v[](z) is just a holomorphic function which obeys the
cauchy-riemann equation. ahlfors had shown[17] that there is an analogue
of eq.(8.7) in higher dimensions.let fi(x) = v[](x), x  sd
hd+1,then the
higher dimensional analogue of eq.(8.7) is given by

(sf )ij =

1

2(cid:18) fi

xj

+

f j

xi(cid:19) 

ij

d + 1

fk
xk

d+1

xk=1

= ij(x)

(8.8)

it can be shown,that eq.(8.8) is reduced to eq.(8.7) in two dimensions.in a
special case ij(x) = 0 one obtains solution of eq.(8.8) in the form

f 0

i = ai +xj

aijxj + bix2  2(b  x)xi

(8.9)

where a and b are some constant vectors and a is a constant matrix which is
the sum of skew-symmetric and diagonal (with the same elements along the
diagonal)matrices. apart from the matrix term in eq.(8.9),the above result
is identical with that known in physics literature,(e.g.see ref.[9], eqn(4.14)).
by analogy with eq.(7.31) in two dimensions (taking into account the ba-
haviour at innity[18]) one obtains for the vector eld

v(z) = (a + bz + cz2)


z

(8.10)

which clearly obeys v ects1lie algebra , eq.(7.15),as expected.the central
extension of this algebra is given by eq.s(7.21),(7.22) is not aected by this
eld since for indices 1,0,-1 one has a(m.n) = 0. this is also in complete
accord with eq.(7.38).this observation has very important consequences. in
particular,if one would like to obtain solution to eq.(8.8) for  6= 0,then
,obviously,the general solution fi is going to be given by

fi = f 0

i + i

49

(8.11)

hence,physically interesting nontrivial solutions of eq.(8.8) are given by
i = fi  f 0
i . this obseravtion can be broadly generalized from the point
of view of cohomology theory to be discussed briey below. in the mean-
time,one is faced with the problem of nding solutions to eq.(8.8) for  6= 0
.ahlfors[17] had found a very ingenious way of doing this. to this purpose,he
had introduced the operator s adjoint to s .without going into details of
its explicit form which could be found in his work,the main point of having
such an operator lies in selecting such (s) for which

s = 0

(8.12)

then,by analogy with results of sections 2 and 3 ,one obtains the following
dirichlet-type problem of nding the solutions of the laplace-like equation
in bd+1 :

d3sd+1sv = 0 ,  =

1

1  x2

,

supplemented with the boundary condition

v |s d

= f , x2 = 1 at sd
.

(8.13)

(8.14)

to solve this equation ,one has to assign the vector elds at the boundary.
a complete solution which takes into account eqs.(8.5),(8.6) was obtained
only quite recently by by koranyi and reiman[41].an alternative derivation
which uses the theory of pseudo- anosov homeomorphisms which we had
recently discussed in connection with dynamics of 2+1 gravity and textures
in liquid crystals was also recently obtained by kapovich[42]. he had proven
the following

theorem 8.5.(kapovich) suppose that v is a smooth automorphic k-
quasiconformal vector eld on the open unit ball b d+1 in rd+1, d  2. then
v admits a continuous tangential extension v to sd
.the vector eld v is
again a k-quasiconformal vector eld on the sphere sd

.

to have some comprehension of these more general results,our experience
with two dimensional case discussed in section 7 is very helpful.it is also useful
for development and appreciation of usefulness of cohomological methods[97]
of study of deformations of kleinian (and ,in general, mobius ) groups.we
shall follow mainly the ideas of refs[35]and[98] since ,in our opinion,they are
the most helpful for undrstanding of more sophisticated treatments[97], [99]
not limited to dimension two.

50

the starting point is eq.(8.7). if v[](z)  f (z) is a vector eld ,then,

naturally, we have to require

f (  z) = f (z)

(8.15)

where  was dened after eq.(5.4).following ref[35],let us call f (z) a po-
tential for .
it is clear,that eq.(8.7) must be consistent with eq.(8.15).
this imposes some restrictions on the potential f that is we have to demand
that the combination f ( z)f (z) vanishes for any   .dene now the
function f () = (f (  z)/)f .taking into account eqs(7.29),(7.31),(8.7),(8.9)
and (8.10) we conclude,that vector f () should be proportional to that given
in eq.(8.10).at the same time,it should satisfy the one-cocycle condition

f (1  2) = (2) (f (1)) + f (2) ,1, 2  

(8.16)

with

indeed, since we have

and

we expect that

(p ) =

f (2) =

 f

f (1  2) =

  f.

(1  2)

use of these results in eq.(8.16) produces the result which is well known in
the theory of dynamical systems[86] :

(1  2) = 



1  



2 .

(8.18)

let w be another potential for ,then p = w  f is again proportional to
the vector eld given by eq.(8.10).thus,w  f = (p ) where (p )() =

51

(p )  p.recall now ,that according eq.(7.29) we had dened (t)(z) =
t(z).therefore eq.(7.9) can be rewritten as t = f t    (f t)1so that
d
dt t |t=0= .by combining this result with eq.(7.29) we obtain

and also,obviously,

df t
dt

|t=0= f (z)  f []

f t   = t  f t

(8.19)

(8.20)

dierentiating the last equation and ,again,taking into account eq.(7.29) we
obtain,

this leads us to

f []   =  + f []  .

 f [] =

f[]  



 f [] =




.

(8.21)

(8.22)

in view of eq.(8.15) we observe that the obtained result is nontrivial.accordingly,
if  f [] is the vector space z 1 of cocycles and (p ) is the vector space b1of
coboundaries ,then the quotient

h 1 = z 1/b1

(8.23)

denes the rst eichler cohomology group of , that is the group of non-
trivial deformations.with some eorts[98] it is possible to construct the sec-
ond and higher eihler cohomology groups.although the above analysis seems
quite natural, the higher dimensional generalizations of such cohomological
arguments were developed so far based on the cohomology theory developed
eilenberg and maclane [100],e.g.see ref[97].,which is conceptually similar
but technically a bit dierent from the eichler theory[98].the reasons for
such limitations of eichlers approach are clear: all arguments use two di-
mensional complex analysis .in our opinion , eilenberg-maclane approach is
more formal and , hence, allows much lesser use of physical intuition. the
famous gelfand-fuks two- cocycle obtained with help of eilenberg-maclane
cohomology theory (in a rather formal way) for the lie algebra of the vector
elds is known to be directly associated with the central extension of the

52

v ects1 lie algebra [101].the authors of ref.[101] acknowlege the formality
of the above derivation of two-cocycle and refer to the work of tabachnikov
[102] which is in complete accord withthat of nag and verjovsky [39] but is
much less complete as compared to ref.[39].

to establish similar results in higher dimensions remains a challenging
problem but already obtained results of refs[18],[97], indicate that such ef-
forts are not useless. in anticipation of more rigorous mathematical results,
we would like now to present some more intuitive physical -type arguments
which unable us to provide some partial answers to the above problems.

|< v, v >= 1} with rd+2

 and the group isom+(sd+1

first,we have to think about the higher dimensional analogue of the lie al-
gebra for the group psl(2,c).in two dimensions it forms a closed sub algebra
within the virasoro algebra.for concretness,let us think about description of
3 dimensional conformal models, i.e.d+1=4 .as it was already demonstrated
by cartan[43] the lie algebra of conformal transformations of rd+1 is iso-
morphic to the lie algebra of the group s(d+1,1) . for our purposes we need
actually only the connected to identity component of s0(d+1,1)=o(d+1,1).
as it was demonstrated by scannell[103] ,this group is simultaneously iso-
morphic to the group isom+(hd+1) which is group of orientation -preserving
isometries of hd+1,the group of orientation -preserving mobius transforma-
tions of sd
) of isometries of the de sitter space
(sd+1
being the space rd+2 equipped
with the signature (d+1,1)). we shall use the last option for reasons which
will become obvious upon reading. incidentally,for d=2 we have to deal with
the group s(3,1) which is just a lorenz group isomorphic to psl(2,c) as dis-
cussed in great detail in ref[[44].it is very striking that the representations of
the lie group s(4,1) ,and in particular,its connected component ,describe the
spectrum of the hydrogen atom[48].this fact is very helpful for treatment of
3d conformal models. from the very detailed analysis of the de sitter group
performed in refs[45],[46]it follows,that the lie algebra of the group s(4,1) is
isomorphic to the direct product of two lie algebras of the group so(3),i.e.
s(4, 1)=so(3)  so(3).but it is well known that so(3) lie algebra can be
mapped onto psl(2,c) (it is intuitively clear since via stereographic projec-
tion the sphere s2 on which so(3) acts is being mapped onto the extended
complex plane(on which psl(2,c) acts) and,indeed,the commutation rela-
tions given by eq.s (4.3) of ref[45],up to a trivial rescaling ,coinside exactly
with those given by eq. (7.15).since v ects1 lie algebra ,eq.(7.15),admits
central extension,we ,thus,arrive at the direct product of two virasoro al-

53

gebras which may have dierent central charges in general.the task now
is to nd the highest weight representations for such tensor product of two
virasoro algebras.

remark 8.6.in the work of balinskii and novikov[104]the multicompo-
nent extension of the virasoro algebra had been already considered (e.g. see
eq.(14) of ref[104]). this case is however is not quite the same as discussed
above since it is based on the embedding of s1into n-dimensional smooth
manifold m, i.e.f: s1  m ,f(x)={ui(x), 1  i  n; x  s1}. accord-
ingly,there is only one central charge.
in the light of the results of gro-
mov,lawson and thurston[95](e.g.see remark 8.4),the results of balinskii
and novikov [104] and,more resently,by mokhov[38] deserve further study.

remark 8.7.some results for the direct products of virasoro algebras
could be found already in the lecture notes by kac(e.g.see chr.11of ref.[48]).
