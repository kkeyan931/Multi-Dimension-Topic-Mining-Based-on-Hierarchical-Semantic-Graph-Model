abstract

it is shown that, under certain conditions, the existence of a killing
spinor on a bosonic background of a supergravity theory implies that
the einstein equations are also satised. as an application of the the-
orem, we obtain a new black vebrane solution of d=11 supergravity,
which has k3  r topology and preserves 1/4th supersymmetries of
the theory.

in string/m theories, solitons are solutions of the corresponding supergravity equa-

tions of motion (for a review see [1],[2]). generically, they can be interpreted as p-

dimensional extended black holes (p-branes) and characterized by few constants, like

the mass and the charges of the antisymmetric tensor elds. the extreme members of

black p-branes, which are obtained when the mass and charge saturate a bogomolnyi

type of bound, are supersymmetric and have stable multi-source generalizations. a

background is supersymmetric, if it is invariant under some supersymmetry transfor-

mations of the theory, whose parameters are called killing spinors. the fact that, the

states related to a supersymmetric soliton should be in the spectrum at any coupling

of the theory, increases the potential importance of such solutions [3].

in many cases, supersymmetric solitons can be obtained by writing suitable ansatzs,

which solve the killing spinor and all but the einstein eld equations from the be-

ginning [1]. then the einstein equations are solved to determine unknown functions.

this indicates that there may be a connection between the two equation systems. in

this paper a theorem is proven which shows that, when the ansatz for the elds and

geometry is chosen in a suitable way, the existence of a killing spinor implies that the

einstein equations are also satised. we hope that this observation will be helpful in

nding new and interesting supersymmetric solutions.

let us consider a bosonic background (gm n ,fm n p q) of d=11 supergravity theory

[4] which obeys:

rm n =

1
3

(fm

p qrfn p qr 

1
12

gm n f p qrsfp qrs),

qf qm n p =

1
(24)2 m n p a1...a8fa1..a4fa5..a8.

(1)

(2)

the linearized rarita-schwinger equations on this background may be written as:

m n p dn p = 0,

where the supercovariant derivative dm is given by

dm = m +

1
144

(p qrs

m  8p

m qrs)fp qrs,

(3)

(4)

and m is the usual covariant derivative acting on spinors. let us further consider
a spin 3/2 eld m , which is obtained by the action of the supercovariant derivative
on an arbitrary majorana spinor :

m = dm .

2

(5)

an interesting question about this spin 3/2 eld is whether it solves the linearized

rarita-schwinger equations (3). the answer is immediately yes, since an arma-

tive statement is equivalent to the invariance of d=11 supergravity at the linearized
fermionic level 3. to verify this let us insert (5) into the eld equations (3). after a
relatively long but straightforward calculation and using only the equations (2) for

the 4-form eld, (3) becomes

(gm n  tm n )n  = 0,

where gm n = rm n  1

2 gm n r is the einstein tensor and

tm n =

1
3

(fm

p qrfn p qr 

1
8

gm n f p qrsfp qrs)

(6)

(7)

is the energy momentum tensor. the presence of the einstein tensor in equation (6)

is due to the following identity:

m

n p [n p ] =

1
8

m

n p rn p rqrq =

1
2

gm n n .

(8)

not surprisingly the terms, which contain m , are canceled. this is because dm
is a certain connection dened on the spinor bundle. the curvature m n of this
connection is given by

d[m dn ] = m n ,

(9)

which certainly does not have a term containing the derivative of . equations (6)

are satised because gm n  tm n = 0 are nothing but the einstein equations (1),
which are obeyed by the background. therefore we ensure, once more, the linearized

supersymmetry invariance of d=11 supergravity.

now, we try to use the results of the above calculations to prove a new theorem.

we assume this time that the given bosonic background does not necessarily solve the

einstein equations (1), but it again obeys the 4-form eld equations (2). we further

assume that there exist a killing spinor 0,

dm 0 = 0;

(10)

and the einstein and the energy momentum tensors have only diagonal entries in an

orthonormal basis. diering from the previous case, for the spin 3/2 eld we make

3in the linearized theory, the supervariation of (3) should vanish upon imposing other

eld equations.

3

the special choice 0
m = dm 0 (which is actually zero) and insert it into the rarita-
schwinger equations (3) (which are trivially satised). the same calculations which

have been done to obtain (6) from (3), now implies that (3) becomes:

(gm n  tm n )n 0 = 0.

(11)

note that to reach (6) from (3), we have only used the 4-form eld equations which

are also satised by the new background. equations (6) are satised for every ma-

jorana spinor , because that background is chosen to obey einstein equations. on

the other hand (11) is correct only for the killing spinor 0, since then the rarita-
schwinger equations are trivially satised. when the indices of (11) refer to the

orthonormal basis, in which by assumption only the diagonal entries of einstein and

energy momentum tensors are non-zero, it implies:

gm n  tm n = 0,

(12)

which are the einstein equations (1) written in a slightly dierent form. therefore

we have proven that:

(i) if a chosen background solves the 4-form eld equations (2),

(ii) if it is known that there exist a killing spinor on this background,

(iii) if there exist an orthonormal basis in which the einstein and energy momen-

tum tensors have only diagonal entries;

then this background, which preserves some fraction of supersymmetries, also

solves the einstein equations of d=11 supergravity.

the main advantage of the theorem is that, to nd a solution of the second order

einstein equations, one can instead concentrate on the rst order killing spinor equa-

tions, which are of course easier to solve. it is not too dicult to write non-trivial

ansatzs which solve the 4-form eld equations from the beginning. note that, for

many of the known black p-brane solutions, assumed form of the geometry and other

elds have the property (iii) (see for instance [5],[6]). this is because the metric of

a static black hole solution depends on a single radial coordinate and usually has
spherical symmetry 4. therefore, it is not a big restriction to fulll the conditions of

4the usual multi-source p-brane solutions do not obey the condition (iii), since the
metrics depend on all transverse coordinates and the ricci tensor has non-diagonal entries.

4

the theorem.

although explicitly proven for d=11 supergravity, such a theorem can be gener-

alized to any supergravity theory. to see this, let us remind that the expression

where

m n p dn dp  = 0,

dm = m + ....

(13)

(14)

is the supercovariant derivative of the supergravity at hand,  is an arbitrary spinor

and elds are evaluated on a bosonic background which obeys the equations of mo-

tion, is a generic condition for the linearized supersymmetry invariance.

in (13),

derivatives of the metric gm n appear only in the combination of einstein tensor, due
to the identity (8). like in d=11 case, the m  terms should cancel. therefore, after
imposing all but einstein equations, (13) should become (6) (with the appropriate

energy momentum tensor of the theory) which is also satised upon imposing einstein

equations; ensuring the linearized supersymmetry invariance.

with the information above, now we can generalize the theorem. dropping the

condition that the background satises einstein equations but assuming the existence

of a killing spinor, one obtains, following (13), again (6) this time evaluated for the

killing spinor. with condition (iii), this implies the einstein equations. therefore, if

we replace (i) with



(i

) if the background satises all but einstein equations,

then together with conditions (ii) and (iii) above , the conclusions of the theorem

should be valid for all supergravities.

let us now illustrate how the theorem may be used for applications. consider

type iib supergravity in 10-dimensions [7]. we focus on the metric gm n and anti-self
dual 5-form eld fm n p qr, and set all other elds to zero. the eld equations which
govern the dynamics may be written as:

rm n =

1
96

f p qrs

m fp qrsn ,

df = 0,  f = f,

5

(15)

(16)

where * is the usual hodge dual acting on dierential forms. the killing spinors, on

a bosonic background, satisfy:

m  +

i

4  480

n p..qm fn p..q = 0,

(17)

where  is a chiral spinor 11 = ; 11 = 0....9, 
illustrational purposes, it is sucient to write a brane-like ansatz for the metric:

11 = 11, and 2

11 = i. for

ds2 = a(r)2(dt2 + dx2

1 + .. + dx2

3) + b(r)2dr2 + c(r)2d2

5(m),

(18)

where d2
5(m) is the usual metric of s5(m); the 5-sphere with inverse radius m. note
that the functions a,b and c depend only on the radial coordinate r. the ricci
tensor has only diagonal entries in the orthonormal basis ei = adxi, e r = bdr and
ea = cea, where xi = t, x1, .., x3; ea is an orthonormal basis on s5(m). when we
write the killing spinor equations, all the spinors and hatted quantities will refer to

the above orthonormal basis. we will also use the notation that, the indices , , , 
refer to the coordinates xi, r and the indices a, b, c, d, e refer to the coordinates of
s5(m).

the 5-form eld may initially be chosen to be a constant times the volume form on

s5(m). the anti-self duality requires that, there should also be non-zero components
along xi and r directions. as a result one may write:

f =

fabcde =

q
c 5  ,
q
c 5 abcde,

(19)

(20)

where q is a constant and the presence of function c is due to the fact that the volume

forms in (19) and (20) are determined by the metric (18). the eld equations (16)

for fm n p qr are trivially satised. the background has now the properties (i
(iii) above. the parameter q is related to the electric and magnetic charges of the

) and



background, which are identical due to the anti-self duality condition. on the other

hand the einstein equations (15) become:

let us now turn to the killing spinor equations (17). we make (5+5) splitting of

the 10-dimensional gamma-matrices m :

 = (  i  1),

a = (i  a  2),

(24)

(25)

where  and a are 5-dimensional gamma matrices and 1, 2 are the usual pauli
matrices. the chirality condition of the spinors becomes 3 = . the killing spinor
equations may now be written explicitly as:

i +

(28)

where a is the usual covariant derivative and eb
one can choose  to be the killing spinor on s5(m) satisfying:

ab = 0.

(29)

note that the indices on (28) and (29) refer to dierent spheres which are conformally

(30)

(31)

(32)

the killing spinor equations become integrable. since the background has now killing

spinors and thus satises the conditions (i



),(ii) and (iii), the einstein equations

should also be trivially satised. indeed, one can check that, when a, b and c obey

(31) and (32), they also solve complicated einstein equations (21)-(23).

7

there are three independent functions and two dierential equations which may

be thought to imply that the functions are not constrained enough. however, the

reparametrization invariance can be used to set c = r. then, from (31) and (32), a

and b can be solved as:

b =

4

4m  qr4 ,

a = b1/4.

(33)

(34)

this is the self-dual black threebrane solution of du and lu [8], written in a

slightly dierent coordinates. to see this, one should make the coordinate change
4mr4  q  r4 and introduce euclidean coordinates for the transverse directions to
the threebrane.

note that, this way of solving eld equations using killing spinors is dierent from

the methods which were used in the past in the context of kaluza-klein compact-

ications, see for instance [9]. it is very dicult to apply those methods to obtain

a brane like solution. however, as we have illustrated, it is very natural to consider

killing spinor equations even to obtain brane solutions. here, we have presented an

example from iib supergravity in 10-dimensions, but one can also obtain the m2 and

m5 brane solutions of d=11 supergravity.

we now use the theorem to nd a new supersymmetric solution of d=11 super-

gravity. basically, one may consider manifolds having killing spinors (like anti-de

sitter (ads) spaces or spheres) and write suitable ansatzs involving them. one of

the simplest possible case that one may work is a space which has covariantly con-

stant spinors like k3. k3 is a 4-dimensional ricci at kahler manifold which has

self dual (or anti-self dual) curvature tensor. it can be described by specifying 58

real constants and has no continuous isometries. the metric, which has self dual

curvature, is not explicitly known but its existence is proven. unlike a generic, ori-

ented, 4-dimensional manifold, the holonomy group is just a copy of su (2) rather

than so(4) = su (2)  su (2). this can be seen by the decomposition of so(4) ten-

sors with respect to their su (2) content. the curvature 2-form is an so(4) valued

tensor, however, due to (anti) self duality, it has only non-zero components in one of

the su (2) bundles. therefore, the other copy of the su (2) bundle is at. because

of this property, k3 has two linearly independent covariantly constant su (2) spinors

which are left or right handed according to the curvature tensor being self dual or

anti-self dual.

8

now, consider the following background of d=11 supergravity theory,

ds2 = a(r)2(dt2 + dx2 + ds2

k3) + b(r)2dr2 + c(r)2d2

4(m),

f = 3 q 4,

(35)

(36)

where ds2
k3 is the line element on k3, 4 is the volume form on s4(m), the four sphere
with inverse radius m, and q is a real constant, which is proportional to the the mag-

netic charge of the background calculated as the integral of f over s4(m). note that,
as before, the unknown functions a, b and c depend only on the radial coordinate
r. we choose the following orthonormal basis on the tangent space, ei = adxi,
e  = ae, e r = bdr and ea = cea, where xi = (t, x), e is an orthonormal basis on
k3 and ea is an orthonormal basis on s4(m). all the hatted indices and spinors will
refer to this basis. we will also use the indices , , ... to denote the coordinates t, x, r

and the coordinates of k3. the indices , ... will refer to the coordinates of k3 only.

it can easily be checked that the conditions (i) and (iii) of the theorem are satised

by the background. let us therefore consider the killing spinor equations. we make

the (7+4) splitting of 11-dimensional gamma matrices a as,

 = (  5),

a = (i  a),

(37)

(38)

where  and a are the 7 and 4-dimensional gamma matrices, respectively. the
killing spinor equations (10) can now be written explicitly as,

i +

i r  +

(39)

(40)

(41)

(42)

where  and a are covariant derivatives on k3 and s4(m), respectively, and 
denotes dierentiation with respect to r. one can choose  to be the tensor product

of covariantly constant spinors on k3 and the killing spinors on s4(m). furthermore,
it can also be chosen to be independent of the coordinates t and x, and thus satises,

i  = 0,

(44)

note the dierence between the killing spinor equations (29) on s5 and (45) on s4.
equations (39)-(42) can be integrated if one also imposes,

(46)

(47)

(48)

the projection imposed on  is consistent with the equations (43),(44) and (45). using

the reparametrization invariance, one can set c = r. solving for a and b we obtain

the following supersymmetric solution,

ds2 = (cid:18)m 

2q

r3(cid:19)1/3

(dt2 + dx2 + ds2

k3) +(cid:18)m 

2q

r3(cid:19)2

dr2 + r2d2

4(m),

(49)

f = 3 q 4,

(50)

which represents a magnetically charged vebrane wrapped on the manifold k3. the
horizon is located at r = (2q/m)1/3 and, unlike the horizon of the well known guvens
vebrane [5], it seems to be a singular surface. one faces with the same kind of sin-

gularities when the vebrane wraps a torus [10]. at spatial innity, i.e. when r  ,
the solution approaches r7  k3 and therefore related to the m-theory compactied
on k3. the mass can be calculated with respect to this background and turns out to

be proportional to q. due to supersymmetry, the mass and the charge saturate the

bogomolnyi bound and thus they are equal.

there are 8 killing spinors, which can be constructed as the tensor product of the

single killing spinor of the space parametrized by t, x, r obeying (46), 2 covariantly

constant spinors of k3 and 4 killing spinors of s4(m). therefore, the solution pre-
serves 1/4th supersymmetries of the theory.

as a consequence of the supersymmetry, the new solution we obtained has also

multi-source generalizations which can be found by dening a new radial parameter
r, r3 = mr3  2q, and introducing cartesian coordinates, ~r, on the euclidean space

10

transverse to the vebranes.

in this coordinate system, the elds of multi-source

vebranes having k3  r topology can be written as

ds2 = h 1/3(dt2 + dx2 + ds2

k3) + h 2/3d ~r.d ~r,

f = dh,

(51)

(52)

where  is the hodge dual in the transverse euclidean space, h is a generic harmonic
function of the coordinates ~r,

h = 1 + i

qi

| ~r  ~ri|3

(53)

and the constants ~ri and qi denote the position and the magnetic charge of the ith
vebrane, respectively.

this solution is very similar to the guvens multi-source vebrane, the only dif-

ference is that the 4 at directions of the branes are replaced by k3. this amounts to

break 16 supersymmetries of the original solution by another half. indeed, k3 can be

replaced by any other ricci at four dimensional manifold, however, a generic choice

may break all the supersymmetries. the presence of k3 also breaks the translational

invariance along 4 directions on the branes (note that k3 has no isometries). the ef-

fective theory describing the dynamics is a d = 2, n = 8 supersymmetric eld theory.

there are 24 fermionic and 12 bosonic zero modes which give 12 on-shell fermionic

and bosonic degrees of freedom. the 9 of the bosonic zero modes are related to the

broken translational invariance and 3 of them should come from the uctuations of

the four-form eld on the vebrane background.

let us conclude by mentioning some other possible new solutions which may be

obtained by using the killing spinor equations. a simple modication is to replace

the 5-sphere s5 in (18) by s2  s3, s1  s4 or by any other compact space which have
killing spinors and diagonal ricci tensors. this may lead to threebrane solutions

with dierent transverse spaces. of course, this modication can be applied to all

brane solutions. in some supergravities, one can also work with calabi-yau or other

kahler manifolds instead of spheres, which may give generalizations of compactica-

tions studied in [11].

another interesting choice is conformally ads or de-sitter type of geometries

for the branes. when the conformal factors depend on a single radial coordinate

11

transverse to the branes, these spaces will also have killing spinors and diagonal

ricci tensors. this may give branes with ads or de-sitter topologies. one can also

try to obtain time dependent cosmological type solutions, by changing the role played

by the time coordinate t and the radial coordinate r in the above construction. these

new possibilities will be studied elsewhere.
