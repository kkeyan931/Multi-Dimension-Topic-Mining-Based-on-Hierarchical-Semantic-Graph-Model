abstract. we discuss the ultraviolet niteness of the two-dimensional bf model coupled to topo-
logical matter quantized in the axial gauge. this noncovariant gauge xing avoids the infrared
problem in the two-dimensional space-time. the bf model together with the matter coupling is
obtained by dimensional reduction of the ordinary three-dimensional bf model. this procedure
furnishes the usual linear vector supersymmetry and an additional scalar supersymmetry. the
whole symmetry content of the model allows to apply the standard algebraic renormalization
procedure which we use to prove that this model is ultraviolet nite and anomaly free to all
orders of perturbation theory.

1 introduction

topological eld models have been an object of intense interest over the last decade and
brought signicant developments to the understanding of the topology and geometry of
low dimensional manifolds [1, 2]. the main property of the topological models [3] is the
fact that the observables depend only on the global structure of the space-time manifold
on which they are dened, e.g. no physical degrees of freedom exist locally. in particular,
they are independent of any metric which may be used to dene the classical theory.

there are two dierent types of topological eld theories. the rst one is called witten-
type [4] whose whole gauge xed action may be written as a total brs variation. the
most prominent example of witten-type models is the topological yangmills theory. the
second type of topological models are the schwarz-type models characterized by the fact
that only the gauge xed part of the action is an exact brs-variation. the examples
of the schwarz-type models are chern-simons and bf theories. a common feature of
such models is the presence of the so-called topological linear vector supersymmetry. the
corresponding operator  and the usual brs-operator s form a graded algebra of wess-
zumino type:

{s, } =  .

the aim of the present work is to analyze the ultraviolet behavior of two-dimensional
bf model with a matter coupling [5] quantized in the axial gauge. the infrared and
ultraviolet behavior of the pure two-dimensional bf model has been already discussed
in [6, 7]. usually the propagators in two space-time dimensions are not well-dened in
the infrared region. in the present work, however, the use of the axial gauge removes the
singular behavior at long distances. to carry out the proof of perturbative niteness we
will use the ordinary algebraic renarmalization procedure in the context of brs-symmetry
[8, 9, 15]. besides the usual brs-symmetry there exists also the topological linear vector
supersymmetry [9] together with an additional topological scalar supersymmetry. the
latter scalar supersymmetry is a by-product in reducing the three-dimensional bf model
to two-dimensional space-time. the whole symmetry content of the model is basis for the
proof of the ultraviolet niteness.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we present the classical algebraic properties
of the model at the classical level. we display the brs-transformations, the topological
linear vector supersymmetry and the additional scalar supersymmetry. in section 3 we
discuss the proof of perturbative niteness of the model by analyzing its stability. the
same arguments as in [13] imply that the model is free of anomalies.

2 the classical model

the action of classical bf model living on manifolds m with (n + 2)-dimensions can be
dened [1, 3, 9] according to

sbf = trzm

bf =

1
2n!

trzm

dn+2x 1...n+2b1...nfn+1n+2

,

(2.1)

where f is a two-form

f = da +

1
2

[a, a] =

1
2

fdxdx,

a is the usual gauge connection one-form and b is a n-form:

b =

1
n!

b1...ndx1 . . . dxn

.

(2.2)

(2.3)

this action has a topological character since it is independent of the metric of the manifold
m.

in the case of two-dimensional at euclidean space-time the action of the bf model reads

s(1)
inv =

1

2 zm

d2x f a

 a ,

(2.4)

where  is the totally antisymmetric levi-civita tensor (with 12 = +1), a is a scalar
eld and f a

 is the eld strength given by

f a
 = aa

   aa

 + f abcab

ac

.

(2.5)



here, aa
 is the gauge eld with the group index a. all elds belong to the adjoint
representation of some compact semi-simple gauge group g whose structure constants
f abc are completely antisymmetric in their indices. the generators of the lie algebra are
chosen to be anti-hermitian and subject to [t a, t b] = f abct c and tr(t at b) = ab.

the action (2.4) is invariant under the following innitesimal gauge symmetry

(1)aa
(1)a = f abcbc

 = a + f abcab
,

c  (d)a ,

(2.6)

where a and d stand for a local gauge parameter and the covariant derivative respec-
tively. this action has much been investigated in [6, 7]. following [5, 13] we enlarge the
model by adding to (2.4) the following topological matter interaction term:

s(2)

inv = zm

d2x (db)ax a

,

(2.7)

with two additional elds: a vector eld ba
invariant under (1):

 and a scalar eld x a. the action (2.7) is

(1)ba
 = f abcbbc
(1)x a = f abcbx c

 ,
.

2

(2.8)

the introduction of the matter coupling (2.7) implies that the total action

sinv = s(1)

inv + s(2)

inv

possesses an additional gauge symmetry given by

 = 0 ,

(2)aa
(2)a = f abcbx c
(2)x a = 0 ,
(2)ba

 = (d)a ,

,

(2.9)

(2.10)

where a is another innitesimal local parameter.

as usual, the quantization of gauge eld models requires a gauge xing in order to guar-
antee the existance of the gauge eld propagators. this is done consistently by the intro-
duction of the faddeev-popov ghost elds in the context of the brs-framework [8]. since
there are two dierent gauge symmetries in the model, the brs-quantization procedure
requires two sets of ghost elds with the corresponding lagrange multiplier elds. we
therefore introduce two faddeev-popov ghosts (ca, a) with the corresponding antighosts
(ca, a) and two lagrange multipliers (ba, da). we choose the axial gauge and add the
following gauge xing term to the action sinv:

sgf = szm
= zm

d2x (cid:16)canaa
d2x (cid:16)banaa

 + anba

 + danba

(cid:17) ,
  can(dc)a  an(d)a + f abcacbnbc

(cid:17) ,(2.11)

where n is a xed gauge direction. the complete gauge xed action is, by construction,
brs-invariant

s(sinv + sgf ) = 0 ,

(2.12)

where the nilpotent and nonlinear brs-transformation read as

 = (dc)a ,
 = (d)a  f abccbbc

saa
sba
 ,
sa = f abccbc  f abcbx c
sx a = f abccbx c

,

sca = 

1
2

f abccbcc

,

sa = f abccbc
sca = ba ,
sa = da ,
s2 = 0 .

,

sba = 0 ,
sda = 0 ,

3

,

(2.13)

in order to control the n-dependance of the theory one enlarges the brs-transformations
by allowing also a variation of the axial vector n [10]:

and by adding the following term to the action

sn =  ,

s = 0 ,

sn = trzm

d2x (cid:16)caaa

 + aba

(cid:17) .

here,  is an anticommuting parameter. obviously, the new action

s = sinv + sgf + sn

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

is now invariant under the enlarged brs-transformations (2.13) together with (2.14).
the physical situation is represented by putting  to zero. we present the canonical
dimensions and the faddeevpopov charges of all elds in table 1.

as usual for topological eld models the action (2.16) possesses besides the brs-symmetry
an invariance with respect to the linear vector supersymmetry:

a = n ca ,
ca = aa
ca = 0 ,
ba = ca ,
n = 0 ,

a = ba
a = 0 ,
da = a
 = 0 .

 ,

,

one can easily verify that

s = 0 .

,

(2.17)

(2.18)

moreover, the action (2.16) is left invariant under a further topological scalar supersym-
metric transformation acting on the elds as follows

 = n a ,

aa
a = 0
ca = x a
ca = 0 ,
ba = 0 ,
n = 0 ,

,

 =  n ca ,

ba
x a = 0 ,
a = a ,
a = 0 ,
da = 0 ,
 = 0 .

(2.19)

this symmetry1 may be interpreted in the following manner. first note that two-
dimensional bf model coupled to topological matter can be obtained by a dimensional
reduction of the three-dimensional bf model. the symmetry (2.19) corresponds then to
the third component of the topological vector supersymmetry of the three-dimensional
bf model [14]. the brs-operator (2.13), the vector supersymmetry  (2.17) and the
operator  dened in (2.19) form an algebra of wess-zumino type which closes on-shell
on the translations:

{s, s} = 0 ,

{s, }aa

{s, }a = 0, a  {a, x a, ca, a, ca, a, ba, da} .

(2.20)

moreover, the following algebraic relations hold

{, } = 0 ,
{, } = 0 ,
{, } = 0 .

(2.21)

in order to describe the brs-symmetry content consistently at the functional level, we
introduce a set of external sources coupled to the nonlinear brs-variations of the quantum
elds:

sext = zm

d2x ha(saa

) + la(sca) + a(sa) + a(sba

) + da(sa) + y a(sx a)i

.

(2.22)
we display the canonical dimensions and the faddeevpopov charges of the external
sources in table 1.

1the use of this symmetry simplies the the proof of the niteness of the theory as we will see later

on.

3 proof of the niteness

this section is devoted to discuss the full symmetry content of the theory at the quantum
level, e.g. the question of possible anomalies and the stability problem which ammounts
to analyze all invariant counterterms.

8

we begin by studying the stability. this requires the analysis of the most general coun-
terterms for the total action and implies to consider the following perturbed action

 = (0) +  ,

(3.41)

where (0) is the total action (2.23) and  is a functional depending via  on the same
elds as (0) and satisfying the slavnov identity (2.24), the ward identity for the vector
supersymmetry (2.26), the two gauge conditions (2.34), the two ghost equations (2.35), the
two antighost equations (2.38), the two ward identities of the rigid gauge invariance (2.39)
and (2.40), the ward identity for the translations (2.33) as well as the ward identity (2.29).
the perturbation  collecting all appropriate invariant counterterms is an intergrated
local eld polynomial of dimension two and ghost number zero.

now we are searching for the most general deformation of the classical action such that
the perturbed action  still fulllls the above constraints. the perturbation  must
therefore obey the following set of equations:



ca + n 
a + n 




ba = 0 ,

da = 0 ,
a = 0 ,
a = 0 ,
s(0) = 0 ,
w = 0 ,
p = 0 ,
d = 0 ,

ca = 0 ,

a = 0 ,
ha = 0 ,
n a = 0 .

(3.55)

the rst two equations (3.42) and (3.43) imply that the quantity  does not depend on
the multiplier elds ba and da. the validity of (3.44) and (3.45) implies that dependance
of (a, ca) and (a, a) is given by the following combinations

a = a  nca ,
a = a  na
.

(3.54)

the equations (3.46)(3.49), as in reference [11], can be collected into a unied operator

 = 0 .

(3.56)

here,  and  are constant vectors of ghost numbers +2 and +1 respectively and the
quantities  and  are constant scalars of ghost numbers +2 and +1 respectively. it can
be easily veried that the operator  is nilpotent

(3.57)
due to the nilpotency of  any expression of the form   is automatically a solution of
(3.56). a solution of this type is called a trivial solution. hence, the most general solution
of (3.56) reads

2 = 0 .

(3.58)
here, the nontrivial solution c is -closed (c = 0), but not trivial (c 6=  ). let
us begin with the determination of the nontrivial solution of (3.56). for this purpose we
introduce a ltering operator n :

 = c +   .

n = zm

d2x x






,

(3.59)

where  stands for all elds, including n, , ,,  and . to all elds we assign
the homogeneity degree 1. the ltering operator induces a decomposition of  and 
according to

 = 0 + 1 + . . . ,  = 1 + 2 + . . .

(3.60)

the operator 0 does not increase the homogeneity degree while acting on a eld polyno-
mial. on the other hand, the operator n increases the homogeneity degree by n units.
similarly, n is a eld polynomial of homogeneity degree n. furthermore, the nilpotency
of  leads now to

hence, we obtain from  = 0 the following relation

2
0 = 0 ,

{0, 1} = 0 .

01 = 0 ,

(3.61)

(3.62)

(3.63)

(3.64)

,

we notice that the elds n, , ,,  and  transform under 0 as doublets, being
therefore out of the cohomology [12]. the nontrivial solution 1
c can now be written as
intergrated local eld polynomial of form degree two and ghost number zero:

1

c = zm

0
2

,

(3.65)

where p
q is a eld polynomial of form degree q and ghost number p. using the stokes
theorem, the poincare lemma [12] and the relation {0, d} = 0, where d represents the
nilpotent exterior derivative (d2 = 0), we obtain the following tower of descent equations:

00
01

2 + d1
1 + d2
02

1 = 0 ,
0 = 0 ,
0 = 0 .

(3.66)

the tower of descent equations (3.66) has been solved in [13], where it was shown that
the ghost equations (3.50) and (3.51) imply that the solution 1
c must vanish identically.
the usefulness of the decomposition (3.60) relies on a very general theorem stating that
the cohomology of the complete operator  is isomorphic to a subspace of the cohomology
of the operator 0.

next, we move to the computation of the trivial counterterms. these are constrained
by the dimension and ghost number requirements. the scalar elds  and x both have
vanishing dimension and ghost number zero, so that an arbitrary combination of them
may appear innitely many times in the counterterm. for the most general and possible
combination of these elds we use the notation f [, x] as introduced in [13]:

f [, x] =



x{ni},{mi}=0



ni,mi  
yi=0

nix mi! ,

(3.67)

where {ni} and {mi} are understood as {n0, n1, . . .} and {m0, m1, . . .}, respectively. here,

ni,mi are constant coecients to be determined. the most general trivial counterterm
  where  has dimension 2 and carries ghost number -1 reads:

(3.68)

the trivial counterterm may depend on the quantities , ,  and  which do not appear
in the total action (2.23). for this reason we demand the expression (3.68) to be invari-
ant under the ward-operators of the vector supersymmetry and translations as well as
under the ward-operator d. a lengthy and tedious analysis yields that the counterterm
satisfying these conditions must vanish identically, so that for the determination of the
trivial counterterms contrary to [13] the use of the ghost equations (3.50) and (3.51) is
not needed any more due to the invariance under the symmetry d.

the last problem is devoted to the discussion of possible existance of breaking of the
symmetries. as shown in reference [13] for landau gauge [9] and under the assumption
that the quantum action principle is also valid in the case of noncovariant gauges [15],
the symmetries appearing in the model do not admit any anomalies and are valid at the
full quantum level. this completes the proof of niteness of the model to all orders of
perturbation theory.
