abstract

within the ads/cft correspondence we use multicentre d3-brane metrics to investi-
gate wilson loops and compute the associated heavy quarkantiquark potentials for the
strongly coupled su(n) super-yangmills gauge theory, when the gauge symmetry is
broken by the expectation values of the scalar elds. for the case of a uniform distribution
of d3-branes over a disc, we nd that there exists a maximum separation beyond which
there is no force between the quark and the antiquark, i.e. the screening is complete.
we associate this phenomenon with the possible existence of a mass gap in the strongly
coupled gauge theory. in the nite-temperature case, when the corresponding supergrav-
ity solution is a rotating d3-brane solution, there is a class of potentials interpolating
between a coulombic and a conning behaviour. however, above a certain critical value
of the mass parameter, the potentials exhibit a behaviour characteristic of statistical
systems undergoing phase transitions. the physical path preserves the concavity prop-
erty of the potential and minimizes the energy. using the same rotating-brane solutions,
we also compute spatial wilson loops, associated with the quarkantiquark potential in
models of three-dimensional gauge theories at zero temperature, with similar results.

1 introduction

the study of n = 4 su(n) yangmills (sym) gauge theory at large n and for large t
hooft coupling constant r4 = 4g2
ymn, is based, in the supergravity approach, on the
type-iib supergravity solution representing n coincident d3-branes. the metric is

ds2 = h1/2(dt2 + dy2

1 + dy2

2 + dy2

3) + h 1/2(dx2

1 + . . . + dx2

6) ,

where the harmonic function parametrizing the solution is given by

h = 1 +

(2)

the constant string coupling is e = gs = g2
ym and we have omitted the self-dual ve-
form. the eld theory correspondence [1, 2, 3] is obtained by going to the near-horizon
limit

where the metric factorizes as ads5  s5 with both factors having equal radii r.

when the su(n) gauge symmetry is broken by non-zero expectation values (vevs) for
the scalar elds, then the appropriate supergravity solution has a metric given by (1),
but with the single-center harmonic function (2) replaced by the multicentre one

whereas the dilaton remains constant.

in the ads/cft correspondence isometries of the background are identied with
global symmetries of the gauge theory. a generic choice of vectors xi completely breaks
the su(4)  so(6) r-symmetry of the theory. however, in this paper we consider cases
where the r symmetry group is only partially broken to so(4) times a discrete subgroup.
this is achieved by placing the d3-branes in a plane lying in the six-dimensional space
transverse to the d3-branes. it is worth mentioning that in the eld theory limit (3)
there in no supersymmetry enhancement since the (super)conformal invariance is broken
by any non-zero vevs and only n = 4 super-poincare invariance remains. an important
question is whether there exist supergravity descriptions of the same theories with broken
gauge group at nite temperature. the corresponding solutions must be non-extremal
versions of the backgrounds corresponding to multicentre metrics. the construction
of such solutions is in general not possible since at non-extremality the gravitational
attraction of the non-bps branes is no longer balanced by their rr-repulsion. however,
this is possible when we are dealing with rotating d3-brane solutions [4, 5, 6, 7] when the
attractive forces are balanced by centrifugal forces. in this paper we will use a class of
such solutions which has one rotation parameter [5] that breaks the r-symmetry so(6)
of (1) with (2), to a so(4)u(1) subgroup. in this case the extremal limit of the solution
describes a uniform distribution of d3-branes over a disc [8, 6].

1

in this paper we are interested in computing the quarkantiquark potential using
rotating d3-branes since multicentre supersymmetric d3-brane solutions, with a contin-
uous distribution for the branes, arise when the extremal limit is taken.
in order to
calculate the quarkantiquark potential we use a method introduced by [9, 10]. accord-
ing to this prescription the expectation value of a wilson loop of the eld theory living
on the boundary is given by the partition function of a fundamental string in the rel-
evant background and xed on the boundary to the contour of the wilson loop which
is to be calculated. in principle this amounts to summing over all possible surfaces of
arbitrary genus with the given boundary conditions and all quantum uctuations. in the
supergravity approximation, which is valid for large t hooft coupling r4 = 4ng2
y m ,
the problem reduces to nding the minimal area surface which ends on the contour of the
wilson loop on the boundary. the wilson loop calculated using this procedure deviates
from the usual denition of wilson loops as it includes the adjoint scalar elds (and
the fermions). this can be understood as follows: in string theory an external quark
(or antiquark) is represented as an open string stretched from the horizon (location of
the d3-branes) to the boundary of ads. since the string pulls the d3-branes, the d3-
branes are deformed and this amounts to turning on scalar elds of the worldvolume
theory on the branes. along the wilson loop the scalars can take non-trivial paths in all
six transverse directions but in the following we will consider wilson loops for which only
the scalar corresponding to the radial coordinate u is active and the others are chosen
to be constant.

to be more specic we have to minimize the nambugoto action of a fundamental
string in the relevant supergravity background. in order to calculate the potential be-
tween a quark and an antiquark we take a rectangular loop on the boundary with one side
of length l in the space direction and one of length t in the (euclidean) time direction,
as in eld theory. since the conguration is static, the time integration trivially yields a
factor of t

+ f (u)/r4 ,

where g(u) = g  gu u and f (u) = r4g  gyy, for supersymmetric theories at zero and
nite temperature (section 2 and 3). in section 4, where we study supergravity duals of
non-supersymmetric gauge theories one of the spatial coordinates, say y1, is taken as the
euclidean time and, hence, g(u) = gyygu u and f (u) = r4g2

yy.

the integrals for the length and energy of the wilson loop, respectively are computed

using standard methods developed in [10, 9]. they are given by

is the minimal u0 allowed by the physics and the geometry of the particular application.
this could be the radius of the disc in the case of the corresponding multicentre metric or
the horizon in the case of non-zero temperature. note that we have chosen the arbitrary
constant that may be added to the energy given by (7) in such a way that the energy of
a non-interacting pair of quark and antiquark is zero. from the form of the multicentre
harmonic (4) it is clear that our multicentre metrics approach, for large u, the metric
corresponding to ads5  s5 and the same would also be true for the rotating brane
solutions. in the conformal case [9, 10] we have f (u) = u 4, g(u) = 1, umin = 0 and we

is obeyed. in physical terms (10) and (11) mean that the force between the quark and
antiquark is always attractive and a non-increasing function of their separation distance.
these conditions were proven in general in [11], building on work in [12]. hence, they
should be satised by the potentials computed using the ads/cft correspondence at
any order of approximation and in particular in the supergravity approximation. using
(6) and (7) we nd that

where the prime denotes a derivative with respect to u0. hence, the force remains always
attractive, except at the point where f (u0) = 0 and (10) is always satised. however, the
concavity condition (11) might fail since, even though in all of our examples f (u0) > 0,
there can be occasions where l(u0) changes sign.1 we will see that such behaviour
1this, apparently, is in conict with theorem 1 in [13]. given the explicit nature of our calculations

in sections 3 and 4, it seems that the validity of this theorem is restricted for eq q < 0.

occurs only on non-physical branches of the potential and it was already encountered in
previous examples [14, 15]. we also note that, due to (12), l and eq q reach their extrema
at the same value of u0.

the paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we study wilson loops in n = 4 sym
with broken gauge symmetry using the background for d3-branes uniformly distributed
on a disc. we show that there is a screening behaviour such that the potential vanishes at
a nite distance. we argue that this signals the existence of a mass gap in the theory at
strong coupling. in section 3 we consider wilson loops in n = 4 sym at nite temper-
ature, using rotating d3-brane solutions and work out the phase structure in detail. in
section 4 we use the same rotating d3-brane backgrounds to study non-supersymmetric
gauge theories in three dimensions and nd, as expected, connement but we also nd
a phase transition depending on the ratio of the mass to the rotation parameter. we
present our conclusions and some open problems in section 5. we have also written
an appendix, where we briey discuss wilson loops obtained using the background for
d3-branes distributed uniformly on the circumference of a ring.

2 d3-branes distributed on a disc

as our rst example we consider n d3-branes distributed, uniformly in the angular
direction, inside a disc of radius r0 in the x5-x6 plane. their centers are given by [8]

xij = (0, 0, 0, 0, r0j cos i, r0j sin i) ,

i =

2i
n

,

r0j = r0(cid:16)j/n(cid:17)1/2

,

i, j = 0, 1, . . . ,n  1

(14)

and uniformity of the distribution means that we take the constants ci appearing in (4)
equal to 1. since we are interested in the large-n limit we may take n = integer
without loss of generality. for a number of d3-branes n  1 and in the eld theory
limit (3), where in addition we keep the energy of strings stretched between d3-branes
situated at the centers nite by rescaling r0  r0, we may replace the sum by an
integral and the metric takes the form (1) with harmonic given by [8]

(15)

it is easy to see that the harmonic above is indeed singular inside a disc of radius r0 in
the x5-x6 plane. this distribution of d3-branes is what one obtains [6, 8] in the extremal
limit of the d3-brane rotating solution with one rotation parameter of [5].

2.1 trajectory orthogonal to the disc

there are two simple trajectories we use to investigate the quarkantiquark potential.
first consider the trajectory in the hyperplane dened by

x5 = x6 = 0 ,

u = 0 ,

that is, along an axis passing through the center of the disc. in that case we have

f (u) = u 2(u 2 + r2

0) ,

g(u) = 1

(16)

(17)

and the minimum value for u0 is umin = 0. the expression for the length as a function
of u0 is given by (we change the integration variable in (6) and (7) as  = u 2)2

l = r2u0qr2

behaviour, as expected, but an expansion of the integrals for small u0 reveals a quite
dierent behaviour for larger values of l. we nd that

and

eq q =

hence, we see that there exists a maximum length

lmax =

,

(20)

(21)

(22)

after which there is no force to keep the quark and antiquark together. solving for u0 in
terms of l using (20) and substituting back into (21) we nd that

respectively. in this paper we follow the conventions of [16, 17].

where the step function (lmax  l) enforces the maximum length condition. the
potential goes to zero for a nite separation lmax which corresponds to a trajectory that
goes all the way down to u = 0 i.e. it touches the disc.

the heavy quarkantiquark potential energy as a function of the separation is depicted

by curve (b) in g. 1.

2.2 trajectory lying on the plane of the disc

for the trajectory along an axis which lies on the plane of the disc and goes through its
center, we have

x1 = x2 = x3 = x4 = 0 ,

u = u

f (u) = (u 2  r2

g(u) = 1 ,

(24)

(25)

whereas umin = r0. the latter condition means that no trajectory can penetrate the
disc. after we change the integration variable as  = u 2 the integral (6) for the length
becomes

by curve (a) in g. 1.

2.3 the mass gap

we have seen that in both cases there exists a maximum length at which the force
between the quark and antiquark becomes zero, i.e. complete screening! for a separation
of the quarkantiquark pair l > lmax we do not nd a geodesic connecting them and
the solution is given by two straight strings corresponding to zero potential and zero
force between the quark and the antiquark. the latter state is in fact the physical one
and prevents a violation of the condition (10). screening-type behaviour is typical for
wilson loops at nite temperature [15] and also in theories at zero temperature but with
running ym coupling constant [18] (due to non-constant dilaton), but was not expected
for a theory at zero temperature with constant dilaton. from a physical point of view the
existence of a maximum length lmax  r2
means that one cannot probe at arbitrarily
small energy scales. this is a signal that the gauge theory at strong coupling exhibits
a mass gap mgap  r0
r2 . in order to investigate that we start with the massless wave
equation

gg = 0 .

we make the ansatz  = (u)eiky and dene the (mass)2 as m 2 = k2 in the spirit of
[19]. in the background (15) we obtain the following second order dierential equation4
for (u)

where c1, c2 are constant coecients. the solution valid for q = 0 can also be written
down using [16, 20], but it will not be needed for our purposes. depending on the value

4the coordinate u appearing in this subsection is not the same as the one in (15). the two are related

by the coordinate transformation (50), relating (51) to (40), if we analytically continue r2

of m the parameter q is real or purely imaginary. we will show that only in the latter
case we may obtain a basis that is orthonormalizable in the dirac sense (with the use of
a -function) with measure duu. indeed, the behaviour of (35) for small u is

  c1(cid:16) r0

as u  0+ .

(36)

hence, if q is real, the orthonormalizability condition requires that c1 = 0. on the
other hand if q is imaginary, the reality condition requires that c1 and c2 are complex
conjugate to each other. similarly the behaviour of (35) for large u is

(38)

as we have mentioned, real q requires that c1 = 0 and, because of (38), c2 = 0, as well.
hence, the only possibility to have square integrable solutions is to require an imaginary
q. indeed, then (37) behaves as 1/u 4 for large values of u. furthermore, the condition
that q is imaginary leads to a mass gap6

mgap =

(39)

which is of the order expected from the quarkantiquark potential computations. the
mass spectrum above the mass gap is continuous.

3 rotating d3-brane solution

a rotating d3-brane solution of type-iib supergravity was found in [5] (based on [4]).
for our purposes we pass to the euclidean regime, where the time variable as well as
the angular parameter, are analytically continued. in the eld theory limit the metric is

5in nding the asymptotic behaviours in (36) and (37) below, we have used the fact that f (a, b, c; 0) =

1, the relation 15.3.14 of [20], as well as some properties of the psi function.

6similar conclusions have been reached by [21].

using the expression for the curvature invariant rr as given by eq. (3.21) of [5]

in this section we are interested in calculating the potential between a quark and an
antiquark in a four-dimensional gauge theory at nite temperature.7 at nite tempera-
ture the time coordinate is periodically identied and the rectangular wilson loop at zero
temperature is wrapped on the time direction. therefore the topology of the boundary of
the wilson loop at nite temperature is that of two circles separated in the space direc-
tion by a distance l. on the supergravity side this means that we have to minimize the
area of a cylindrical string ending on two cycles at the boundary. since the conguration
is time independent the formulae (5)(7) used to calculate the quarkantiquark potential
can be used without modication.

3.1 finite temperature and zero rotation

before we examine the general case in detail we focus our attention to two particular
limits, where the metric (40) simplies considerably and we may compute the integrals
in the rst, the parameter r0  . then we obtain the
in (6) and (7) explicitly.

3.2 the supersymmetric limit and a multicentre metric

a second interesting limit is the extremal limit corresponding to r0  , where the
solution becomes supersymmetric. in this case (strictly speaking exactly for  = 0) the
part of the singularity surface at u 2 = r2
0 cos2  corresponding to  = 0 concides with
the location of the would be horizon which, using (42), is easily seen to be at uh = r0.
the nature of this surface, where there will be a distribution of d3-branes, becomes
transparent after the change of variables (valid for the region u0  r0)

8in the absence of the logarithmic dependence in (48) and (49) the potential energy would have gone
to zero as l2 for small separations. due to the presence of logarithms it is not possible to nd the
analytic expression of the potential energy as a function of the length even if this is small. nevertheless
we easily deduce that it goes to zero faster that l2. the authors of [14] have presented a power law
behaviour of the type l3.6 based on numerical tting.

11

notice the symbol u in (50) and (51) refers to two dierent coordinates. the harmonic
function above can be obtained from (15) if we analytically continue r0  ir0. this
continuation changes the singularity structure of the harmonic function. it does no longer
represent d3-branes uniformly distributed over a disc of radius r0 at the x5x6 plane, but
rather d3-branes uniformly distributed over a 3-sphere dened by x2
4 = r2
0
and x5 = x6 = 0. notice that the location of the singularity coincides with that of the
would be horizon and therefore there is no meaning of hawking temperature in this case
(note that the expression for th in (43) diverges in the limit   0).

before we actually compute the wilson loops associated with the supersymmetric
limit, let us show that even in that limit there exists a mass gap and, hence, we expect
screening. as before we start with the massless wave equation (33), with the same ansatz
 = (u)eiky and denition of the (mass)2 as m 2 = k2. then we obtain a second order
linear dierential equation for (u), which after changing variables as

which is the jacobi equation. this has a complete set of normalizable solutions in terms
of the jacobi polynomials provided that the mass spectrum is quantized as

n = 1, 2, . . . .

(54)

in that case y (z)  p (2,0)

of the order of the mass associated with the lowest eigenvalue n = 1, which gives a mass
gap mgap  r0

we note that the potential described by (63) and (64) is the same as that found in [23]
using a two-center metric, even though this is a dierent supergravity solution than (51).

the plot of the potential energy as function of the quarkantiquark separation is
given by curve (b) in g. 5. notice the smooth interpolation between the coulombic and
conning behaviour.

3.3 the general case

we would like to study the quarkantiquark potentials arising at general values of 
and r0 from trajectories having dierent, nevertheless constant, values for the angle .
since there is an explicit dependence of the metric components on , consistency requires
that the variation of the nambugoto action with respect to  is zero in order for the
equations of motion to be obeyed. it is easy to see that this procedure allows  = 0 or
 = /2. there is no problem setting to a constant all the other angular variables, since
the metric components do not explicitly depend on them.

with u0  umin = uh , where the location of the horizon is given in (42). for large u0
the potential is, as usual, coulombic, but there exists a maximal separation as has been

14

depicted in g. 2 for various values of . at the values of u0 where the separation is
maximal also the energy is maximal and always positive (g. 3). this means that there
is screening behaviour because once the potential turns positive a conguration of two
separate strings, each bounded by a circle in the euclidean time direction, is energetically
favoured and corresponds to vanishing force between the charges. as u0  uh we nd
both the length and the energy approach zero as

the second branch of the potential starting at the point of maximal separation and going
to zero distance and zero energy is unphysical for three reasons. first, since the energy
on this branch is always positive the rst branch is preferred because it minimized the
energy. second, it violates the concavity condition (11) (see also (79) below). third, when
u0  uh the circumference of the string in the euclidean direction becomes arbitrarily
small in the region close to the horizon. since the loop is contractible the string can
split into two strings which have the shape of discs bounded by a circle. therefore, the
potential vanishes and this explains the screening when the two quarks are separated
beyond the maximal distance.

however, for indermediate values of the separation distance the behaviour of the system
depends crucially on the value of the ratio  = 
. there is a critical value cr  2.85
r0
such that for  < cr the behaviour is qualitatively the same as in the case  = 0 that
we have already examined (see curve (a) in g. 5).

however, for  > cr the behaviour is dierent and resembles the situation occuring
in rst order phase transitions in statistical systems.10 we describe the situation below
and we also refer to gs. 6 and 7 for graphical details of the length as a function of u0 and
of the potential energy as a function of the length. in particular, there are three dierent
branches corresponding to the segments abcdef, fjklm and mnopqrs. for large
u0, equivalently small l, we have the usual coulombic behaviour given by (9) (point a
in gs. 6 and 7). as we lower u0 we see that for all points until point b there is a unique
value for u0, that is a unique trajectory, corresponding to each value for the length. at
point b two dierent values for u0 correspond to the same value for the length (the other

10in terms of thermodynamic quantities, our l, eq q and u0 correspond to pressure, gibbs potential
and volume, respectively. at  = cr the rst order phase transition degenerates to a second order one.
then u0 plays the role of an order parameter. for details on the related statistical and thermodynamical
aspects see, for instace, [24].

and r0 respectively.
for small separation distances l  0, both curves approach the coulombic law. for
large separation distances we obtain a linear behaviour. curve (b) can also be obtained
using (63) and (64).

point is m) and after that until point d there are three dierent u0s for each value of the
length (for instance, c, n and l). note also that in the entire path abcd the energy is
the smallest compared with the points on the other two brances having the same length.
when the unique point d is reached the energy-surface intersects itself and after that the
energy minimum comes from the other branch of the curve. hence, all three points q,
e and j have the same length, but the physical state corresponds to point q since this
has the smallest energy among the three. therefore, we conclude that the physical path
is not the one joining the points adfkmos but rather abcdoqrs, where the energy
is always a minimum for a given value of the length. hence, the entire branch fjklm
connecting the two extrema f and m is unphysical. there is an additional reason that
this branch is not part of a physical path, namely that there the concavity condition
for the potential (11) is violated. this is easily seen by rst nding the behaviour close
to the two extrema marked by f and m. using (12) and (13) we nd that close to a
maximum f

is another positive constant. we see that the concavity condition (13) is violated in the

18

branch fjklm. in contrast, in the entire physical path abcdoqrs this condition is
preserved. note also that exactly at the critical value  = cr  2.85 the rst order
degenerates to a second order phase transition. then using the fact that not only the
rst but also the second derivative of the length vanishes at some critical value u cr
0 we
nd that

finally, we want to comment on the conning behaviour for large quarkantiquark
separation, present for all values of  and r0, which is somewhat unexpected. once the
potential becomes positive a conguration of two separate worldsheets is energetically
preferred. the breaking of the tubelike worldsheet connecting the quarkantiquark pair

is possible if the proper length of the circle g  /th  , as the string approaches the
horizon. using our metric (40) we nd that breaking of the string is likely when either
 & rr0 or r0 & r and in these cases one has screening as in the case of  = 0. on
the other hand, for r0   the circumference  r is quite large and the worldsheets

on the conning branch of the potential are stable, although its energy is larger than
that of two disconnected worldsheets. the answer to this problem might be related to
the discussion in [23], where an (unexpected) linear potential was found to be unstable
because of extra qcd states.

4 rotating d3-brane for ym in three dimensions

models of ym theories in 2+1 dimensions at zero temperature can be constructed using
non-extremal d3-branes by compactifying the euclidean time direction on a circle of
circumference  = 1/th [19, 25]. an extension of this model, where there is a clear
decoupling of the kaluzaklein modes associated with the euclidean time compared
to the modes that have vanishing kaluzaklein charge, is based on rotating d3-branes
[5, 26, 7]. the space-space wilson loop for the zero-rotation case has been computed in
[14, 27].

as before setting to a constant all the angles in searching for trajectories is consistent

with the equations of motion only in the cases  = 0 or  = 
2 .

similar to what we have already encountered in section 3, there exists a critical value
cr  0.46 for the ratio  = 
, such that for  > cr the behaviour goes smoothly from
coulombic to conning. however, for  = cr there is a second order phase transition
and for  < cr the behaviour diers and resembles the one depicted in gs. 6 and 7.

it is important to note here that this is not a transition from connement to columbic
potential in a three-dimensional theory but in a four-dimensional theory on a circle. only
for large separation of the external charges is the theory eectively three-dimensional and
we observe connement. but for small distances the string can probe the extra dimension
and the coulomb behaviour is that of the compactied four-dimensional theory.

as in section 4.1 we found a transition from connement to coulomb law but the force
between the external charges is a smooth function of l. also in this case the comments
made in the last paragraph of section 4.1 apply.

5 concluding remarks and some open problems

we have studied wilson loops and computed the associated heavy quarkantiquark po-
tential within the ads/cft correspondence and in the supergravity approximation.

we have studied four-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories at zero temperature
with broken gauge symmetry using multicentre d3-brane solutions. in this case we found
that there is a complete screening of charges that we attributed to the existence of a mass
gap in the gauge theory. it is very important to understand such a mass gap from a eld
theoretical view point. a rst diculty is that the mass gap and in fact all interesting
phenomena, occur at a scale  r0
r2 whereas the vev masses  r0 are much larger. this
has a similarity with the fact that two dierent energy scales occur in the ads/cft
correspondence [28]. it is also important to understand to what extend our results are a
feature of the continuum nature of the brane distribution.

gauge theories at nite temperature were also studied using rotating d3-brane so-
lutions. in this case we found two distinct classes of potentials. one is similar to that
obtained using non-extremal d3-branes with zero rotation and one that interpolates be-
tween a coulombic and a conning potential. in the latter case, depending on the ratio
of the extremality to the rotation parameter, the interpolation is smooth or the transition
between the two regions is reminiscent of phase transitions in statistical systems. the
potential contains three distinct branches one of which violates the concavity condition
stating that the force between a quark and an antiquark is a monotonously decreas-
ing function of their separation. however, the physical path, similarly to the physical
isotherm in statistical systems, connects the coulombic and the conning regions of the
potential through the coexistence point, where the potential is smooth, but the force is
discontinuous. it would be extremely interesting to understand this discontinuity from a
eld theory point of view. using the same rotating brane solution, non-supersymmetric

22

three-dimensional gauge theories at zero temperature were also studied by computing the
heavy quarkantiquark potentials from the associated space-space wilson loops, yielding
similar results.

there are several straighforward, but quite important, generalizations of our work.
the rst is to study the potentials arising from the most general rotating d3-brane
solution [4, 6, 7] (eq. (30) in [7]), that contains three rotational parameters. it can be
easily seen that trajectories with all the angles corresponding to s5 xed, exist. second, it
will be interesting to compute the heavy quarkantiquark potential from the space-space
wilson loop obtained using the rotating d4-brane solution of [29]. this is appropriate
for studying, in the present context, four-dimensional non-supersymmetric gauge theories
at zero temperature. finally, we mention that a concavity condition for wilson loops,
generalizing (11), has been derived [30] for the cases that there is a relative orientation
between the quark and antiquark with respect to the sphere coordinates. the prototype
computation of such potentials was done, for the case of the ads5  s5 background, in
[10] and indeed it obeys the condition of [30]. in that respect it is important to know if
this generalized concavity condition is obeyed by the similar potentials one would obtain
using rotating d3-brane metrics.

another important line of research concerns the inclusion of corrections to the leading
order supergravity approximation. it would be interesting to include -corrections to
the supergravity backgrounds and to study how they eect our solution. note, that such
corrections are always present for the n = 4 theory on the coulomb branch since the
weyl tensor does not vanish and the grosswitten term in the supergravity action is
non zero. only at the origin of the coulomb branch is the weyl tensor exactly zero
and ads5  s5 is an exact background of type iib string theory. although a complete
formulation of string theory in the background of ramond elds is still missing it would
also be interesting to calculate corrections due to worldsheet uctuations. this could
be done e.g. using a greenschwarz formulation and expanding around the classical
conguration. calculations of this kind have recently been performed in [31].

a d3-branes distributed on a ring

in this appendix we compute the quarkantiquark potential for n branes distributed,
uniformly in the angular direction, around the circumference of a ring of radius r0 in the
x5-x6 plane [8]. their centers are given by

xi = (0, 0, 0, 0, r0 cos i, r0 sin i) ,

in the limit of a continuous
distribution of branes where n  1, we may set n equal to 1. this is a very good
approximation unless we approach the ring at u = u = r0 at distances such that u/r0

we studied two kinds of trajectories, one where the trajectory is orthogonal to the
plane in which the ring is lying i.e. u = 0, and one where the trajectory runs in a radial
direction in the plane of the ring towards the center of the ring, i.e. u = u. in the rst
case we nd (without setting in (a.2) n = 1) for f (u) and g(u) the same functions
as in (62). hence, the corresponding quarkantiquark potential is the same as the one
computed in section 3.2.2. in the second case we consider only the continum limit, where
n = 1. we have

for u0  r0 the potential is coulombic and has the same form as in (9). in contrast

therefore

this can be interpreted as a screening of the l1 coulombic potential to a l2 potential at
large separation. the latter behaviour is characteristic of a quarkantiquark potential of
a gauge theory living on d4-branes or on d3-branes smeared along a transverse direction.
indeed, for large l when the corresponding trajectory approaches the ring circumference,
it can be shown [8] that the supergravity solution becomes that of a d3-brane with a
transverse direction smeared out. one nds that f (u) = 4r0u 3 and g(u) = 1. then
applying (6) and (7) we conrm (a.8)(a.10).

finally, let us mention that there is no known nite temperature supergavity solution
corresponding to the ring geometry for d3-branes. due to the no-hair theorem the
rotating d3-brane solutions are unique and in the supersymmetric limit they give rise to
a uniform distribution of d3-branes, in the case of one angular momentum, over a disc.
the ring geometry arises naturally in the supersymmetric limit of rotating ns5 and d5
branes [32]. then, the background corresponds to the exact conformal eld theory coset
model sl(2, ir)/u(1)  su(2)/u(1) [8, 32] .
