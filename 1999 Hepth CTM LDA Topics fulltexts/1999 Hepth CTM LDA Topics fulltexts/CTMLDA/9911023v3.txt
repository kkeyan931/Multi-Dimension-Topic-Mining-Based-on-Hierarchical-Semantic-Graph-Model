we solve exactly the 6-vertex model on a dynamical random lattice, using its representation
as a large n matrix model. the model describes a gas of dense nonintersecting oriented
loops coupled to the local curvature defects on the lattice. the model can be mapped to
the c = 1 string theory, compactied at some length depending on the vertex coupling.
we give explicit expression for the disk amplitude and evaluate the fractal dimension of its
boundary, the average number of loops and the dimensions of the vortex operators, which
vary continuously with the vertex coupling.

1. introduction

the correspondence between the critical phenomena on at and random lattices has

been very useful in various problems related to random geometry. especially interesting

from this point of view are the o(n) model[1,2,3,4,5] and the q-state potts model[6,7,8,9],

which allow a neat geometrical interpretation in terms of a gas of loops or clusters with

fugacity depending on the continuous parameter n or q. considered on a at lattice, these

statistical models can be mapped onto the 6-vertex model [10], whose infrared behavior is

that of a compactied boson. the continuous parameters n and q are then related to the

compactication radius. the mapping [11], known as coulomb gas picture, also prescribes

to install a background electric charge at innity.

on an irregular lattice, the background electric charge, which is in fact coupled to the

local curvature, should be distributed all over the lattice, which can be achieved only by

introducing nonlocal operators at all points with curvature. the mapping does not hold

any more, which means that, when considered on a random lattice, the 6-vertex model

describes a new type of critical phenomena, in which the local curvature of the lattice is

involved.

more concretely, let us consider the representation [10] of the 6-vertex model as a gas

of oriented loops. the fugacity of each loop is given by a phase factor, the phase being

proportional to the geodesic curvature along the loop. on the at lattice, the geodesic
curvature is always 2 and all loops have the same fugacity. on the contrary, on a
lattice with defects, the geodesic curvature can take any value between /2 and , and
the fugacity of the loop depends on the local curvature of the lattice. in this way, the

6-vertex model on a random lattice allows to study extended objects coupled to the local

curvature, unlike all previously considered statistical models.

the 6-vertex model on a random lattice is also interesting from the string theory point

of view, because it gives a dual denition of the compactied c = 1 string, in which the

vortices can be constructed explicitly as local operators. as such, it was considered rst by

p. ginsparg [12], who formulated the corresponding matrix model. the relation between

the 6-vertex model on a random lattice and the c = 1 string theory has been further

elucidated by s. dalley [13], who in particular identied the compactication radius as a

function of the vertex coupling.

in this paper we present the exact solution of the 6v model dened on a planar

random lattice of any nite size. the solution is obtained using the equivalence with a

special hermitian matrix model, which is a generalization of the o(2) matrix model [1].

1

we will calculate the disk amplitude and investigate its scaling behavior. we will evaluate

the fractal dimension of the boundary of the random surface as well as the average number

of loops per unit area. we will also calculate the dimensions of the m-vortex operators
(m  1), which in the loop gas representation are the sources of m equally oriented vortex
lines. our results agree with the correspondence between the 6-vertex model on a random

surface and the compactied c = 1 string theory, where vortices represent discontinuities

on the world sheet.

the paper is organized as follows.

in sect. 2 we remind the denition of the 6v

model on a at and random lattices as well as the correspondence with a compactied

boson, respectively with the compactied c = 1 string theory. the model dened on a
random lattice depends on two coupling constants: the vertex coupling   [0, 1] and
the cosmological constant 1/t coupled to the number of squares of the lattice. then

we formulate the partition function of the model as a matrix integral, making one step

further than the original denition by p. ginsparg [12]. in sect. 3 we formulate and solve

the saddle point equations for the resolvent of the random matrix for all allowed values

of the two couplings.

in sect. 4 we analyze the the scaling limit of the solution near

the critical coupling where the size of the random lattice explodes. in sect. 5 we give

a discussion and a summary of the results. the three appendices contain the proof of

the exact correspondence between the 6v matrix model and the compactied c = 1 string

theory (a), the technical details of the calculation (b), and the solution of the o(2) matrix
model obtained as the   0 limit of our general solution (c).

while this manuscript was being prepared, we received the interesting paper by paul

zinn-justin [14], in which some of our results concerning the critical behavior are derived

using a dierent technique.

2. the 6-vertex model on a dynamical random lattice

2.1. review of the 6-vertex model on a at square lattice: f -model, loop gas, vortices,

mapping to a compactied boson.

the degrees of freedom of the 6-vertex model on a square lattice [10] represent arrows

associated with the links of the lattice. the admitted congurations of arrows do not

contain sources and sinks, so that there is an equal number of arrows that begin and end

at each vertex. the partition function is dened as the sum over all arrow congurations,

with boltzmann factor, which is a product of the statistical weights associated with the

2

vertices of the lattice. on the dual lattice, the arrows go across the edges and the vertices

are associated with the squares. there are 6 possible vertices, which can be divided into

two types depicted in fig.1, the vertices of each type being related by /2-rotations.

(a)

(b)

fig.1: the two types of vertices of the 6v model.

for a special value of the spectral parameter the weights of the vertices of each class have

the same boltzmann weight. this specialization of the 6v model is known as the f -model.

the weights of the two distinct vertices (a) and (b) of the f-model can be parametrized

as

(a)

a = b = 1,

(b)

c = 2 cos()

(2.1)

where the parameter  will be assumed to belong to the interval [0, 1]. following the

standard argument of baxter [10], we decompose the vertices into couples of line seg-

ments making left or right turn as is shown in fig.2. the weights (2.1) are then obtained
by assigning a boltzmann factor ei/2 to each line segment, where the sign is positive

(negative) if the line makes a left (right) turn.

(a)

+

(b)

fig.2: decomposing the vertices as pairs of line segments.

the sum over vertex congurations on each surface can be thus put in the form of a sum
over fully packed closed nonintersecting loops. the boltzmann weight of each loop l is
the product of all phase factors along it,

e i

2  = ei(l),

yl

3

(2.2)

where  is the geodesic curvature along the loop

(l) =



2(cid:16)# left turns  # right turns(cid:17).

(2.3)

by the gauss-bonnet formula, on the at lattice  = 4 and the weight of each loop (after
summing over both orientations) is 2 cos(2). in the 6-vertex model one can introduce

vortex operators of vorticity m, representing sources of m equally oriented lines. on the at

lattice m is restricted to be a multiple of 4. the 8-vertex model represents a deformation
of the 6-vertex model obtained by adding vortices with m = 4 with nite fugacity d.

the 6-vertex model can be rewritten as a solid-on-solid (sos) model by assigning a
variable   zz to the sites of the dual lattice in such a way that the adjacent heights
dier by /4. the oriented loops are then interpreted as domain walls of height /4.
the m-vortex operator creates a discontinuity m/4 at a site.

at large distances the height variable renormalizes to a free massless boson com-

pactied on a circle of length  = 2r [11]. if we choose the scale so that the duality

transformation acts as

r

or

then the conformal dimensions of the magnetic operators are

vertex model [10] with the conformal dimension vortex

, one nds

 = 1  2.

(2.6)

the kosterlitz-thouless point is at  = , where the lowest vortex operator (m = 4)

becomes marginal.

2.2. the 6-vertex model on a dynamical random lattice: loops, vortices, mapping to the

compactied c = 1 string theory

since the weights of the f -model are invariant with respect to /2-rotations, the
model can be considered on any irregular square lattice s. the partition function can be
again reformulated as a sum over loop congurations (fig.3), each loop l weighted by the
geodesic curvature (2.3)

f (s) = xloop conf

igurations yloops l

ei(l).

4

(2.7)

in this case the geodesic curvature (2.3) depends on the geometry of the lattice through
the gaussian curvature (the total decit angle) r(l) enclosed by the loop l

(l) = 2  r(l).

(2.8)

therefore (l) can be any integer (positive or negative) times /2.

fig.3: a piece of the random lattice covered by oriented loops.

we dene the partition function f (t, , n ) of the f model on a dynamical random
lattice as the average of the partition function (2.7) in the ensemble of all connected

abstract lattices obtained by gluing squares along their edges. the partition function
depends on the cosmological constant t coupled to the area (# squares) a(s) and the
string coupling constant 1/n coupled to the genus g(s) of the lattice:

f (t, n, ) =xs

n 22gt az(s).

(2.9)

it is natural to expect that the critical behavior of this statistical model is described by a

compactied boson interacting with a liouville eld. indeed, as it was shown in [13], the
exponential z = ef can be identied with the partition function of a c = 1 string theory
compactied at length  = 2r, related to the vertex coupling as

r =

1  

2

 = (1  ).

or

5

(2.10)

here the scale is xed again by adopting the convention (2.4), according to which the

self-dual radius is r = 1 ( = 2). for completeness, we give a short prove of the

correspondence in appendix a. note that this is not the same correspondence as on the

at lattice and there is no reason that it should be the same.

a vortex with vorticity m again represents a source of m equally oriented lines meeting

at a point. however, since the lowest vortex charge is m = 1, an m-vortex operator creates

a discontinuity mon the world sheet. it is necessarily accompanied by a conical singularity
with curvature r = 

4 (4  m).

the scaling dimension of an m-vortex operator is obtained from the corresponding

at dimension1 (2.5) by the kpz rule [15] and reads

vertex
m

=

m/2

2

= m

1  

4

.

(2.11)

the scaling dimensions of vortex operators with m = 1, 2, 3, 4 are always smaller that one,

which means that the interval 0 <  <  is deep in the vortex plasma phase. however,

this is not a problem because in our model the fugacities of all vortices are strictly zero.

3. the 6v matrix model

3.1. from a complex matrix integral to a coulomb gas system

ginsparg noticed in [12] that the exponential of the partition function (2.9) can be

identied with the perturbative expansion of the following matrix integral

zn  ef(t,n,) = r dxdx exp(cid:16)n tr[t xx + x 2x2  cos  (xx)2](cid:17)

t ntrxx

(3.1)

r dxdxe

where the integration goes over all n  n complex matrices x.

at the point  =  ( = 0), this matrix integral describes the dense phase of the o(2)

model on a random triangulation [1], or equivalently the compactied c = 1 string at the

kosterlitz-thouless point  = . the correspondence with the compactied string for any

 has been worked out by s. dalley [13]. for readers convenience we give the proof in

appendix a.

1 of course the length  is now given by (2.10) and not by (2.6).

6

the vortex operators are introduced by adding a source term to the matrix potential,

namely

svortices = n xm1

dm
m

(trx m + trxm).

(3.2)

the model (3.1) in presence of vertices (the random-surface analog of the 8-vertex model)
has been solved in two particular cases:  = 0, d1 and d2 6= 0 [13] and c = 0, d4 = b [16].
the complex matrix integral (3.1) becomes gaussian at the price of introducing an

auxiliary hermitian matrix a:

zn z dadxdx ew (x,a),

w (x, a) = n tr(cid:18)

1
2

a2 + iaxxei/2  iaxxei/2 

(3.3)

t xx(cid:19) .

the result of the integration over x is a matrix integral which can be viewed as a  6= 
deformation of the o(2) matrix model

.

(3.4)

the integrand depends only on the eigenvalues a1, ..., an of the matrix a. after a liner
change of variables, we write the partition function as

note that when n is nite, the partition functions (3.8) and (3.8) do not coincide, because
the parametrization (3.7) assumes that a is negative. however, the two partition functions
lead to the same 1/n espansion of the free energy and the observables.

(3.17)

the spectral density is equal to the discontinuity of the resolvent along the cut

w ( + i0)  w (  i0) = 2i()

(3.18)

and the integral equation (3.11) implies the following functional equation for the resolvent

w ( + i0) + w (  i0)  w ( + i)  w (  i) =

(3.19)

the normalization condition for the density can be written also as an integral along

a contour c surrounding the interval [b, a]:

3.3. geometrical meaning of the saddle point equations

let us introduce the new potential

u (z) =xn

tn enz
2 sin n

related to the old one by

v (z) =

u (z + i/2)  u (z  i/2)

i

,

and consider the meromorphic function

j(z) = i[w (z + i/2)  w (z  i/2)] + u(z).

the function j(z) is completely determined by the following four conditions:

(3.20)

(3.21)

(3.22)

(3.23)

(1) it is periodic with period 2i: j(z + i) = j(z  i);
(2) it has two cuts {rez  [b, a], imz = i/2} in the strip |imz|  , and satises along
the cuts a two-term functional equation

j( + i/2  i0) = j(  i/2  i0),   [b, a];

(3.24)

9

(3) its series expansion at z  + is
e2z +

j(z) =

t2

sin 

t1

2 sin /2

ez

(3.25)

+ 2 sin(/2)w1 ez + 2 sin  w2e2z + ...

where wn are the moments of the spectral density dened by (3.17).
(4) it satises the normalization condition (3.20): if c1 is a contour surrounding the upper
cut, then

dz
2

ic1

j(z) = 1.

(3.26)

the rst two conditions mean that the function j(z) is a single valued analytic function
on the torus obtained from the strip |imz|   by cutting it along the intervals {rez 
[b, a], imz = i/2}, then identifying its two edges (imz = ) as well as the upper
lower edge
of the rst cut with the lower
upper edge of the other one. the two main cycles of this torus are
homotopic to the contour c1 surrounding the upper cut, and the contour c2 connecting
the two cuts.

the variable j is periodic along both cycles while the variable z is periodic along the
cycle c1 and has discontinuity i along the cycle c2. therefore, if we nd a canonical
parametrization

z = z(u), j = (u)

(3.27)

for which the contours c1 and c2 are the images of the periods 1 and 2 of a at rectangle,
then the functions z(u) and (u) will satisfy the following periodicity conditions

z(u + 1) = z(u),

z(u + 2) = z + i,

(u + 1) = (u),

(u + 2) = (u).

(3.28)

therefore, once the elliptic parametrization is found, the problem is essentially re-
solved3. the parameters of the solution are xed by the normalization condition for the
spectral density and the behavior of the function j(z) at z  , which is determined by
the potential u (z).

let u be the point in the periodic rectangle corresponding to z  . the map
is assumed to be regular, which means that ez(u) can be taylor expanded at u = u.
therefore ez(u)  (u  u)1 and the third condition (3.25) says that the function (u)
has a second-order pole at u = u and xes the singular part of its laurent expansion in
u  u.

3 our method is a natural generalization of the method applied by j. hoppe, v. kazakov, the
author and n. nekrasov to resolve technically similar problems [19,20], and which was originally
proposed by j. hoppe [21].

10

3.4. explicit solution in the elliptic parametrization

we will identify the two periods of the torus with the standard quarter-periods of the
jacobi elliptic functions 1 = 2k and 2 = 2ik. the z-cylinder with the two cuts is
parametrized by the rectangle

|reu|  k, |imu|  k.

(3.29)

the function (z) is periodic with periods 2k and 2ik and its only singularity in
the rectangle (3.29) is a double pole at u = u. the residue of this pole is zero, since
otherwise there would be another pole somewhere in the rectangle. the generic function

with such properties (the weierstrass elliptic function) depends on two constants a and b

(u) = a + b

1

sn2(u  u)

.

(3.30)

the function z(u) a+b
is antisymmetric in u, which means that ez(u) has one simple pole
at u = u and one simple zero at u = u. it is therefore natural to look for it as a ratio
of jacobi theta functions. one can easily check that the function

ez(u) = e

the endpoints of the cuts are the four branch points of the inverse map u = u(z), deter-

mined by the condition dz/du = 0. the symmetry of the map (3.31) allows to determine
the four branch points through a single parameter ub  [0, k]:

a  i/2 = z(ub  ik),

the parameter ub is determined from

z(u + ub) + z(u  ub) = 0,

4.2. the scaling behavior of the spectral density. critical exponents associated with the

let us rst check that the string susceptibility exponent str is zero for all . con-
sider the rst momentum of the spectral density, whose singular behavior is that of a

sphere with one puncture

the singular behavior is that of the coecient b, which is given by the third equation

(4.13)

which implies that indeed str = 0 and the free energy has logarithmic singularity

ln 1


.

then we look for the scaling behavior of the spectral density and the resolvent. the

spectral density is related to the function (v) by

(z) =

(v + i/2) + (u  i/2)

2

(4.14)

15

and the resolvent (3.15) is obtained by inverting the relation (3.23)

w (i +  ) = w (i   ) =



 h(cid:16) + i



2(cid:17)  (cid:16)  i



2(cid:17)i .

(4.15)

it is easy to see that the function w (z) has only one cut on the physical sheet (the strip
|imz|  ), which goes along the interval z  b. on the other sheets there is an innite
number of cuts (at least for irrational ), placed at imz = in  , n  zz.
at distances ez  eb, the relation between z and  has two branches

(z)  q

1  (cid:19)
2 exp(cid:18) 2z

(4.16)

associated with the asymptotics at e 
 1. it is the smaller exponent which is the relevant
one, but in the limit   0 the two exponents coalesce and produce the observed logarith-
mic behavior of the spectral density the o(2) model. correspondingly, the  -factor in the
resolvent (4.15) becomes  2 in this limit(see eq. (3.41) of [23]). the limit   0 of the
solution is worked out in appendix c.

now let us nd the scaling of an important observable: the typical length l of a loop

on the world sheet. it is characterized by the critical exponent  [24]

1

2 .

l  a

(4.17)

a related quantity is the average number n of loops on a worldsheet of area a. since a
is the total length of all loops,

21
2 .

(4.18)

n =

to follow the analysis of [24] and [23], it is convenient to return to the original variable
a = e and consider the density

(4.22)

(4.23)

let us also mention that the exponent  determines also the fractal dimension of the e
boundary of the disk amplitude, which is equal to 1
2 .

finally, let us calculate the dimensions of the m-vortex operators representing sources
of m equally oriented lines. the correlation function of two such operators is obtained
by calculating the watermelon conguration made of m nonintersecting lines relating
the two points, as the one shown in fig.5. the singular behavior of such an amplitude is
related to the scaling dimension vertex

of the m-vortex operator as

proceeding in the same way as in sect.4 of ref.[24], one can extract the scaling di-
mension of the m-vortex operator from the scaling behavior of the spectral density (a)
(eq. (4.19)). the amplitude corresponding to a conguration with m open lines is given
(up to the phase factors ei associated with the m lines, which can be neglected) by the
convolutive integral in eq. (4.28) of ref. [24], and has the following singular behavior

5. summary and discussion

in this paper we gave the exact solution of the 6-vertex model on a dynamical random

lattice with spherical topology. the model describes a gas of densely packed loops whose

weights are coupled to the local curvature of the lattice. we have calculated the partition

function of the disk with given length l and area a. for any value of the vertex coupling

, the critical singularity of the free energy corresponds to a theory with central charge

c = 1, but the fractal dimension of the boundary of the disk changes continuously from 1/2

to 1. the limiting value is achieved at  = 1, where the boundary has the same dimension

as the bulk. this reminds what happens in the dense phase of the o(n) model, where at
n  0 the world sheet is all eaten by the boundary. indeed, the exponent 1
for the
growth of the number of loops vanishes when   1, which means that in this limit the
eective fugacity of the loops renormalizes to zero due to the uctuations of the curvature.

2

we also calculated the scaling dimensions of the m-vortex operators, representing sources

of m equally oriented open lines on the world sheet.

all our results agree with the interpretation of the 6-vertex model as a special real-

ization of the compactied c = 1 string theory. from the string theory point of view the

model is interesting with the possibility to treat very explicitly the vortex operators, which

are dicult to construct in the standard realizations of the c = 1 string.

the 6-vertex matrix model describes the c = 1 string theory compactied at length

 < , which is less than 1/4 of the kosterlitz-thouless length  = 4, associated with the

most relevant vortex operator (m = 1). in order to describe a theory compactied at length

up to p, it is sucient to consider a chain of p coupled matrices. the diagonalization can

be performed in a similar way and one obtains a chain of integral equations of the type

(3.11), which seems to be exactly solvable as well.

the loop gas formulation of the c = 1 string theory places a bridge between the

description with continuous target space via matrix quantum mechanics [25] and the matrix

models [26] for the strings with discrete target space (the ade models on a random lattice)

[27], which describe all minimal conformal theories coupled to 2d gravity. in particular,

it is clear why the string diagram technique based on a world sheet surgery [23] works

only for strings with discrete target space. a discrete target space without loops, i.e., a

dynkin graph of ade type, can (and should) be immersed in the continuum by placing its

adjacent points at distance  = , for which the curvature defects do not produce phase

factors for the domain walls. in the case of the c = 1 string compactied at length , this

diagram technique works only at the point  = 1 (the o(2) model).

18

the nonperturbative equivalence with the c = 1 string theory means that the 6v

matrix model is exactly solvable in the so called double scaling limit [28]. the integrability

of this model follows also directly from the fact that the partition function (3.8) is a  -

function of the kp hierarchy. using the scaling properties of the partition function integral,

one can convert the kp equation into an ordinary dierential equation, as it has been done

in ref. [19].

appendix a. equivalence to the c = 1 compactied string

let us integrate with respect to the angular variables in the original matrix integral

(3.1). we decompose

xx = u xu1

with u  su (n ) and x = diag(x1, . . . , xn ), and perform the u (n ) integration with
the help of the harish-chandra-itzykson-zuber formula. using the cauchy identity, the

integrand can be written as a determinant, and the partition function takes the form

zn =z 

0

dx1 . . . dxn det
ij

k(xi, xj)

with

k(x, x) = exp

n

we get rid of the linear term by shifting the integration variable

2t(cid:16)  t (x + x) + 2xx  (x2 + x2) cos (cid:17).

y = cx  y

with

c =pn sin /t ,

y =p2n (1 + )

lator

(a.4)

and the integration is to be done in the semi-innite interval

y < y < .

hence the partition function (a.1) describes a system of n nonrelativistic fermions in
inverse oscillator potential, stabilized by a wall at distance y from the origin4, at temper-
ature  = (1 ). the wall should be suciently far, so that the level of the fermi sea is
below the top of the potential. the critical distance is y0 = 2n , which corresponds to
 = 0. the system of n fermions on a circle of length  gives a non-perturbative denition

of the c = 1 string theory compactied at length . the partition function of this system,

calculated in ref. [29], is invariant under the duality transformation

4 the restriction y >  is in fact imposed only on the trace, but it leads to a rapid exponential

decay of the wave function of the fermions when y < .

and the constant c is certain function of the elliptic modulus, whose explicit form will not

be needed. this is to be compared with the rst three terms in the laurent expansion of

b.2. the normalization condition

the normalization (3.20) means that the integral of j(z) along the contour c1 sur-
rounding its upper cut is equal to one. in terms of the variable u, this integral takes the

form

1

2 z k+ik 

k+ik 

duz(u)(u) = 1.

(b.5)

writing (using the standard notation z(u) = (u)
(u) )

z(y + ik) = z(u + y) + z(u  y)

(y + ik) = a + bk2sn2(u  y),

we arrive at the following integral

1 =

2 z k

k

dy[z(u + y) + z(u  y)][a + bk2sn2(u  y)].

(b.6)

with the help of the addition formula [30], 17.4.35, we write it in the form

1 =

[z(2u)i1 + sn(2u)i2]

where

i1 =z k
i2 = k2z k

appendix c. the special case  = .

here we check that the solution of the o(2) matrix model with quadratic potential is
obtained as the limit    (or   0) of our general solution (3.30)-(3.31). this limit is
quite subtle and does not commute with the scaling limit q  0. in this limit we have

at  = 0 we have more symmetry because the special points of the map coincide with the
quarter of the period, u = ub = k/2, and the function ez(u) becomes a jacobi elliptic
function
