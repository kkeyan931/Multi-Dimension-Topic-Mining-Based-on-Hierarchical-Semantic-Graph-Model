feynman integrals in the physical light-cone gauge are harder to solve than their covariant
counterparts. the diculty is associated with the presence of unphysical singularities due to
the inherent residual gauge freedom in the intermediate boson propagators constrained within
this gauge choice.
in order to circumvent these non-physical singularities, the headlong
approach has always been to call for mathematical devices  prescriptions  some successful
ones and others not so much so. a more elegant approach is to consider the propagator from
its physical point of view, that is, an object obeying basic principles such as causality. once
this fact is realized and carefully taken into account, the crutch of prescriptions can be
avoided altogether. an alternative third approach, which for practical computations could
dispense with prescriptions as well as prescinding the necessity of careful stepwise watching
out of causality would be of great advantage. and this third option is realizable within the
context of negative dimensions, or as it has been coined, negative dimensional integration
method (ndim).

1.

introduction

light-cone gauge in quantum eld theory is a fascinating subject. it is a simple
gauge choice in the sense that the emerging propagator for the boson eld has a
deceivingly simple structure, when compared to other non-covariant gauge choices.
yet, as it has soon been realized, it hid subtle complications when one actually
wanted to work with it.

to make things more concrete, let us analyse it in the framework of vector gauge
elds, e.g. the pure yang-mills elds, where, after taking the limit of vanishing gauge
parameter, the propagator reads,

dab

 (k) =

i ab

k2 + i (cid:20)g 

nk + nk

kn

(cid:21)

(1.1)

where n is the arbritary and constant null four-vector which denes the gauge,
n  aa(x) = 0; n2 = 0. this generates d-dimensional feynman integrals of the
following generic form,

ilc = z

ddki

a(kj , pl)

f (kj n, pl n)
h(kj n, pl n)

,

(1.2)

where pl labels all the external momenta, and n

 is a null four-vector, dual to n.

we will evaluate, as a pedagogical example, an integral where,

a(kj, pl) = (k2)ih(k  p)2ij

, h(kjn, pln) = (kn)l, f (kjn, pln) = (kn)m,

(1.3)

with i, j, l negative and m positive or zero.

a conspicuous feature that we need to note rst of all, is that the dual vector
n
, when it appears at all, it does so always and only in the numerators of the
integrands. and herein comes the rst seemingly misterious facet of light-cone
gauge. how come that from a propagator expression like (1.1), which contains no
n factors, can arise integrals of the form (1.2), with prominently seen n factors?
again, this is most easily seen in the framework of denite external vectors n and
n. an alternative way of writing the generic form of a light-cone integral is

ddki

a(kj , pl)

g(kj

l )
h(kj n, pln)

,

(1.4)

   , 1), and n

l ) denes a tensorial structure in the integral. for a
where the numerator g(k
vector, we have k = (k+, k, kt), where k+ = (k0 +kd1) and k = (k0 kd1)
with  being a normalization factor. if we choose denite n and n such that n =
   , 1), this allows us to write k+  k  n and
(1, 0,
k  k  n. we have therefore traced back the origin for the numerator factors
containing n. by the way, these terms have nothing whatsoever to do with some
kind of prescription input as it is in (2.5) below. there, the n factors are added
into the structure by hand via the ad hoc prescription.

 = (1, 0,

2. prescriptions

now, the troublesome factors in the denominator, represented by h(kj n, pln),

for one-loop, two-point functions are typically products of the form

1

h(kj n, pl n)



1

(k  n) (k  p)  n

.

(2.1)

in the standard approach, these are dealt with rst by partial fractioning them,

a trick sometimes called decomposition formula (see, for example, 1) - 3))

1

(p  k)n(cid:21) ,

pn 6= 0

(2.2)

it is easy to see that such kind of trick becomes very clumsy to deal with when
one has higher powers of denominator factors. in fact, the authors of 3) agree that
the application of (2.2) complicates considerably the calculation of such feynman
integrals. for example, consider,

1

(kn)2 (p  k)n

1

(p  k)n(cid:21) ,

pn 6= 0

(2.3)

and so on and so forth. yet, the standard approach based upon prescriptions, cannot
handle denominator products like these without rst decomposing them. as far
as we know only leibbrandt and nyeo said explicitly before, that decomposition
formulas like (2.2) and (2.3) are in fact part of the prescription 3). be it as it
is, after the decomposition is made, then and only then, one seeks to handle the
isolated denominators calling for prescriptions that would turn them manageable
mathematically.

early eorts in this direction draw heavily from the use of the cauchy principal

value (cpv or pv for short),

p v (cid:18) 1

(2.4)

unfortunately, this prescription, although preserves the general structure of the light-
cone integral (1.2), and is mathematically consistent, does not provide physically
acceptable results in the light-cone gauge 4), 5).

later on, independently mandelstam 6) and leibbrandt 7) proposed new pre-

scriptions to treat the gauge-dependent poles,

1

=

1

qn + i sgn(qn)

qn

(qn) (qn) + i

.

(2.5)

where the former is the modied mandelstam prescription and the latter is the leib-
brandts one. it can be proven that, in fact, they are completely equivalent to each
other, so that sometimes people refer to this as the mandelstam-leibbrandt (ml)
prescription. a conspicuous feature of these prescriptions is that they introduce the
factor (q  n) in the denominator of integrals, thus modifying the original structure.
this, however, does not seem to aect the end result, as far as physically meaningful
results are concerned.

applying the ml prescription for example, in the one-loop two-point function
integrals, double poles still appear but they cancel against each other and one is
left with physical poles only.
in other words, those singularities that are merely
gauge artifacts cancel out when one uses this approach. experts 5) argue, therefore,
that adopting the ml prescription makes the light-cone gauge acceptable, at least
perturbatively. along this line, some two-loop calculations have been performed
explicitly and can be found in the pertinent literature 8).

pimentel et al. realized that when the physical principle of causality is correctly
taken into account  either by careful, stepwise watching out for it to be preserved
along the whole computation, or by implementing it directly onto the propagator, via
causal considerations the same picture arises, namely, unphysical, gauge-dependent
poles cancel out leaving solely physical ones 9), 10). actually, the procedure corre-
sponds exactly to taking out the zero-frequency mode from the fourier series expan-
sion for the eld operators, ensuring that only positive energy quanta propagate into
the future and vice versa. mathematically this can be acomplished via

4

(qn)j = p v (cid:18) 1

(qn)j(cid:19)  i

(1)j1
(j  1)!

(j1)(qn) sgn(q0),

(2.6)

where p v stands for cauchy principal value. the second term of this expression is
crucial. it is the term that guarantees that the troublesome zero-frequency mode of
the eld quanta is subtracted out from the energy spectrum. it is exactly tantamount
to avoiding the pathological mixing of quanta of opposite energy signs propagating
into the future, thus violating causality.

by the very nature in which these prescriptions are introduced, they are com-
pletely powerless to deal with products of light-cone poles without ere using the
partial fractioning trick. moreover, in addition to the need to use the decomposi-
tion formula, the necessity to resort to prescriptions or even clever maneuvers in
order to extract out the culprit factor from the original integral is an awkward trail
to walk along to reach our objective. because a prescription is solely a prescription,
a mere device to by-pass a problem, prescriptions are usually inconvenient and unde-
sirable. yet, as awkward and burdensome as it might be, there was no other way we
could do things properly in dealing with perturbative light-cone gauge computations.

3. negative dimensional approach

not so now, with the advent of ndim 11). ndim is a technique wherein the
principle of analytic continuation plays a key role. with it we solve a feynman-like
polynomial fermionic integral, i.e., a loop integral in negative d-dimensional space
with propagators raised to positive powers in the numerator. solutions arise as linear
combinations of solutions for simple systems of linear equations and these are then
analytically continued to allow for negative values of exponents (i.e. propagators now
become raised to negative powers, becoming denominator terms in the integrands)
and positive dimension 12). this procedure, of course, when applied to the light-cone
case has to consider the general structure (1.2) above which is characteristic of this
gauge. that is, terms like f (kjn, pln)  (qn)a[(q  p)n]b which can appear in
the numerator, evidently must remain there; therefore, no exponents of such terms
are to be analytically continued to allow for negative values 13). schematically (see
for instance second reference in 12)),

z ddki a(kj, pl) f (kjn, pln)h(kjn, pln) ac z

ddki

a(kj, pl)

f (kj n, pl n)
h(kj n, pl n)

(3.1)

where the left-hand side shows the negative dimensional integral to be performed
and the right-hand side displays the generic form (1.2) for the light-cone integrals.
note that the factor f (kj n, pl n) remains in the numerator of the integrands in
both sides. the left-hand side of (3.1), which is evaluated via ndim methodology,
is dened from projecting out powers of gaussian type d-dimensional momentum
integrals of propagators 11). it is worth mentioning here that the usual schwinger
exponentiation of propagators for the factor [h(kjn, pln)]1 in positive dimensional
calculation does not work for light-cone integrals 10).

now, one could rightfully ask: how can one get the standard ml results for one
and two loop ml dimensionally regulated feynman-integrals with the procedure of
negative dimensions? substitute (1.3) in (1.2), that is, consider the integral,

b(i, j, l, m) = z ddq (q2)ih(q  p)2ij

(q  n)l(q  n)m.

(3.2)

let us evaluate it in great detail following the steps thoroughly described in our
previous papers 12). let our starting point be,

g = z ddq exphq2  (q  p)2  q  n  q  ni

where  =  + . taylor expanding the exponentials above and solving for the
integral b(i, j, l, m) we obtain,

b(i, j, l, m) = ()d/2i!j!l!m!(  d/2)!

(3.4)

where  = i + j + l + m + d/2, a = x1 + y1, b = x1 + x2 + x3 + y2, c = x2 + x4,
d = x3 + x4, e = x1 + x2 + x3 + x4. this system of linear algebraic equations has
six possible solutions  since the number of unknowns is bigger than the number of
equations. in all six cases eliminating the deltas leaves us with one remaining sum,
a hypergeometric series 3f2. three out of these six series have as its variable,

z =   p2nn

2p+p! ,

while the other three have as variable

w  z1 =   2p+p
p2nn! .

in our previous work 13), we have considered the simplest one-loop integral in the
light-cone gauge, evaluating it via ndim method, with one- and two-degree violation
of lorentz covariance (more specically, with n only and with both n and its dual
n
). for the rst case we obtained the usual pv prescription result, whereas in the
second case we obtained the mandelstam-leibbrandt prescription result. however,
that toy integral is easily evaluated in the ndim scheme, since there are no left
over summation indices, that is, the number of linear equations in the system equals
the number of unknowns and the result can be expressed just in terms of product
of gamma functions. the integrals we consider here are more complicated; they
generate several linearly independent and dependent solutions which need to be
sorted out carefully. that is, the space of solutions spanned by base functions are
not all linearly independent ones. this is characteristic of these particular cases of

6

integrals we are considering here, and this is the reason we treat them at lenght and
in depth.

from our previous works 12) we know that the feynman integral will be rep-
resented by a linear combination of linearly independent series. moreover, these
representations are related through analytic continuation. let us consider the rep-
resentation of b(i, j, l, m) in terms of z1,

b(i, j, l, m) = b1 + b2,

where

and

b1 = ()d/2  (1 + j) (1 + l) (1 + m)(p2)i(p+)j+l+d/2(p)j+m+d/2

3f2(a2, b2, c2; e2, f2|w),

(3.7)

where a1 = i, b1 = d/2+j, c1 = +d/2, e1 = 1+j +l+d/2, f1 = 1+j +m+d/2,
a2 = l, b2 = ijld/2, c2 = i+m+d/2, e2 = 1l+m, f2 = 1jld/2 and
3f2 is the generalized hypergeometric function 14). this is the result in the negative
dimension region and i, j, l, m positive. now, in order to be physically meaningful
it must be analytically continued to positive dimension and i, j, l negative, while
the exponent m must be kept untouched. to carry out this analytic continuation
one must rewrite the gamma factors as pochhammer symbols and use one of its
properties

(a|j)  (a)j =

(3.9)

in fact, from the theory of hypergeometric functions 14), we know that the hy-
pergeometric dierential equation for pfq has up to p linearly independent solutions,

the light-cone gauge without prescriptions

so, in writing down b(i, j, l, m) we would expect it to contain up to three terms.
indeed, among the three series of funtions 3f2(   |w) there is a third term, namely,

b3 = ()d/2  (1 + i) (1 + j) (1 + l) (1    d/2)(p2)i+j+m+d/2
 (1 + i + j + m + d/2) (1 + l  m) (1  j  m  d/2)

where a3 = i  j  m  d/2, b3 = m, c3 = i + l + d/2, e3 = 1 + l  m,
f3 = 1  j  m  d/2. however, this solution is not a linearly independent one.
indeed, from the fact that m is always positive or zero we can rewrite b3 using
eq.(6), section 3.2 of ref. 14)  if we choose 1 = c3, 2 = a3, n = e3, 1 = f3 
as a linear combination of b1 and b2.

the integral we are considering here was studied by lee and milgram 15). our
result can also be written in terms of the so-called gfunction or meijers function
and agrees with their calculation. taking the special case where i = j = l = 1 and
m = 0 one gets,

b(1, 1, 1, 0) = ()d/2  (2  d/2) (d/2  1)

observe that when d = 4  2 there are simple poles in these two terms but they
cancel since,

to extract the nite part one can proceed in the same way as we did in the second
paper of ref. 12). the other representation for the integral b(i, j, l, m) also coincide
with that presented in 15). in fact, they are related through analytic continuation (see
ref. 14) for such formulas)  as all representations provided by ndim for feynman
integrals in covariant 12) and non-covariant gauges 13).

consider now an integral containing two factors of the form (k  n),

t2(i, j, l, m) = z ddq (q  p)2i(q  n)j [(q  p)  n]l (q  n)m,

(3.12)

where the exponent m  0. the standard approach makes use of decomposition
formulas (2.2) and (2.3). on the other hand, ndim can solve all integrals of such
kind at the same time, giving in positive dimension 17),

t2(i, j, l, m) = d/2  2p+p

(3.13)

observe that the pochhammer symbol which contain (1 + m) was not analytically
continued since m must be either positive or zero.

4. conclusion

finally, in concluding this work we would like to emphasize some important
points concerning the application of ndim technique to light-cone integrals. first
of all, why one needs to dene the original gaussian integral (3.3) with two-degree
violation of lorentz covariance in order to get causality preserving results? the
answer is related to the very denition of light-cone gauge condition where one
has the external four-vector n such that it is chosen to be light-like, i.e., n2 = 0.
however, the light-likeness condition n2 = 0 does not uniquely dene the needed
external vector n to implement the gauge condition. the reason for this is more
easily seen considering a particular case where n = (n0, n3, 0, 0), in which case the
condition n2 = 0 gives as solutions either n0 = +n3, or n0 = n3 with n0 > 0.
therefore, the components of the light-like vector are not linearly independent;
hence the two possibilities: either n  (n0, +n3, 0, 0) or n
  (n0, n3, 0, 0).
these peculiar light-cone properties have been shown by g. leibbrandt 16) to be
connected to the newman-penrose tetrad formalism in the context of gravitation
and cosmology, where a four-dimensional basis is spanned entirely by null vectors.
in his work, leibbrandt demonstrated that the two-dimensional vector sub-space
(n0, n3) cannot be spanned solely by the vector n; it is not sucient for this purpose
because this vector possesses linearly dependent components. a thorough discussion,
including not only the sub-space (n0, n3), but the entire four-dimensional space, is
found in the reference above given.

this is the reason why our ndim calculation done in 13) with only one degree
violation of lorentz covariance failed to be causal, reproducing the well-known
causality breaking pv result. the cure for this pathological result could only be
achieved by introducing the needed additional n
 vector, so that the basis for span-
ning the entire four-dimensional vector space be unique and well-dened. therefore
our calculations here always included this needed dual vector n
, so that our results
are well-dened and unambiguous.

this ndim technique is therefore the most powerful and beautiful machinery
ever to come to front until now to handle the light-cone feynman integrals. all
the desirable features are embedded in it and we can list them as follows:
i) no
decomposition formula like (2.2) is needed to separate gauge dependent poles
before the integral is evaluated; ii) it preserves the general structure of the light-cone
integral, namely, no factors containing n are introduced in the denominators; iii) no
prescription is needed to handle (q  n) = 0 type singularities to solve the integral;
iv) there are no parametric integrals to perform; v) there is no need to split the
dimensionality of space-time to work out integrations over component sub-spaces like
in 2); vi) results are obtained for arbitrary negative exponents of propagators and

the light-cone gauge without prescriptions

9

gauge-dependent poles, so that special cases  which agree 1), 4), 13), 17) with the ones
calculated using ml prescription  are contained in them; vii) results are always
within the context of dimensional regularization, i.e., preserving gauge symmetry.

the power of ndim is therefore readily apparent. if one remembers how inte-
grals over grassmann variables are introduced, he/she can recall that the underlying
property employed to dene them is translation invariance. it is an outstanding thing
that this sole property in the fermionic integration is able to guarantee a prescrip-
tionless light-cone and more important than that, a causality preserving method of
direct computation of feynman integrals.

of course, like in any gauge, two-loop integrals are more demanding when com-
pared to the one-loop case, and specially in the light-cone gauge. preliminary results
we have show that ndim can also handle them with more easiness than in the usual
standard approaches.
