abstract

all cubic couplings in type iib supergravity on ads5 s5 that involve two scalar elds
si that are mixtures of the ve form eld strength on s5 and the trace of the graviton on
s5 are derived by using the covariant equations of motion and the quadratic action for
type iib supergravity on ads5  s5. all corresponding three-point functions in sym4
are calculated in the supergravity approximation. it is pointed out that the scalars si
correspond not to the chiral primary operators in the n = 4 sym but rather to a proper
extension of the operators.

1 introduction

according to the ads/cft correspondence [1, 2, 3], the generating functional of green func-
tions in d = 4, n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory (sym4) at large n and at strong
t hooft coupling  coincides with the on-shell value of the type iib supergravity action on
ads5  s5. for this reason, to calculate an n-point green function one has to know the su-
pergravity action up to the n-th order.
in particular, the normalization constants of two-
and three-point green functions [4]-[25] are determined by the quadratic and cubic actions for
physical elds of supergravity.

the particle spectrum of type iib supergravity on ads5  s5 [26, 27] contains scalar elds
si that are mixtures of the ve form eld strength on s5 and the trace of the graviton on
s5. the transformation properties of the scalars with respect to the superconformal group
of sym4 allow one to conclude that they correspond to chiral primary operators (cpos) of
sym4. in [12] the quadratic and cubic actions for the scalars si have been found and used to
calculate all three-point functions of normalized cpos. these three-point functions appeared
to coincide with the three-point functions of cpos computed in free eld theory for generic
values of conformal dimensions of cpos. however, there is an apparent contradiction. as
was noted in [28] (see also [25]) a three-point function of cpos calculated in the ads/cft
framework vanishes, if the sum of conformal dimensions of any of the two operators equals the
conformal dimension of the third operator, because of the vanishing of the cubic couplings of
the corresponding scalar elds. thus we are forced to conclude that the scalars si used in [12]
cannot correspond to cpos. another way to come to the conclusion is that the scalars from
[12] do not coincide with the original scalars that are mixtures of the ve-form and the graviton
but depend nonlinearly on the original scalars and their derivatives. thus the scalars used in
[12] do not transform with respect to the superconformal group in a proper way and cannot
correspond to cpos.

in this paper we show that a scalar si used in [12] corresponds to an operator which is the
sum of a cpo and non-chiral composite operators. the non-chiral operators are normal-ordered
products of cpos and their descendants, i.e. so-called double- and multi-trace operators.

the knowledge of correlation functions of the chiral primary operators allows one to compute
correlation functions of all their descendants, in particular, the correlation functions of the
stress energy tensor and r-symmetry currents. to compute four-point functions1 of the chiral
operators one has to know the si-dependent quartic terms and all cubic terms that involve
two scalar elds si.
in the present paper, as the rst step in this direction, we determine
all such cubic terms. it is sucient to consider only the sector of type iib supergravity that
depends on the graviton and the four-form potential. there are four dierent types of vertices
describing interaction of two scalars si with symmetric tensor elds of the second rank coming
from the ads5 components of the graviton, with vector elds, with scalar elds coming from
the s5 components of the graviton, and with scalar elds ti that are mixtures of the trace of
the graviton on the sphere and the ve form eld strength on the sphere.

to this end we apply an approach similar to the one used in [12]. namely, we use the
quadratic action for type iib supergravity on ads5  s5 recently obtained in [40] and the
covariant equations of motion of [41, 42, 43]. just as it was in the case of cubic couplings of three
scalars si [12], to get rid of higher-derivative terms we will have to redene the original gravity

1some results on four-point functions have been obtained in [28]-[39].

elds. thus the elds entering the nal action correspond not to descendants of cpos but to
extended operators involving products of cpos and their descendants. however, we expect
that for generic values of conformal dimensions of these operators, their three-point functions
coincide with the three-point functions of the corresponding descendants of cpos. let us note
in passing that the only way to nd an action depending on the elds that correspond directly to
cpos and their descendants seems to be to derive the action starting from the covariant action
of [44, 45]. in this way one probably should obtain a nonvanishing cubic couplings of scalars si
corresponding to cpos whose conformal dimensions satisfy the relation 1 + 2 = 3. these
cubic terms seem to be of the form suggested in [28]. unfortunately, the lack of covariance of
the gauge-xed action of [44, 45] makes the analysis extremely complicated.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we suggest the operators that correspond
to the scalars si from [12]. in section 3 we recall equations of motion for the graviton and the
four-form potential, and the quadratic actions for the elds under consideration, and introduce
notations. in section 4 we obtain cubic couplings of two scalars si with a scalar ti, and with
scalars i coming from the graviton on the sphere, and calculate their three-point functions
by using results obtained in [7]. in section 5 cubic couplings of two scalars si with symmetric
second rank tensor elds are derived and the corresponding three-point functions are found.
in section 6 we obtain cubic vertices of two scalars si and a vector eld, and calculate their
three-point functions. note that three-point functions of two scalars with a massive vector
eld, or a massive symmetric second rank tensor, were not considered in the literature before.
in the conclusion we discuss the results obtained, and open problems. in the appendix we
recall the denitions of scalar, vector and tensor spherical harmonics.

2 extended chiral primary operators

in this section we recall the denition of chiral primary operators and introduce a notion of
extended chiral primary operators.

according to [12], cpos have the form

oi(~x) =

(2)k
kk

i1 ik tr ( i1(~x)   ik(~x)),
c i

(2.1)

where c i
c i
i1ikc j

i1ik are totally symmetric traceless rank k orthonormal tensors of so(6): hc ic ji =
i1 ik = ij , and i are scalars of sym4.

the two- and three-point functions of cpos computed in free theory are [12]

ij

hoi(~x)oj(~y)i =
|~x  ~y|2k ,
hoi1(~x)oi2(~y)oi3(~z)i =

1
n

k1k2k3hc i1c i2c i3i

|~x  ~y|23|~y  ~z|21|~z  ~x|22

,

(2.2)

(2.3)

where i = 1
2(kj + kl  ki), j 6= l 6= i, and hc i1c i2c i3i is the unique so(6) invariant obtained
by contracting 1 indices between c i2 and c i3, 2 indices between c i3 and c i1, and 3 indices
between c i2 and c i1.

according to the ads/cft conjecture, there should exist elds of type iib supergravity on
ads5  s5 that correspond to cpos. the transformation properties of cpos and supergravity

3

elds with respect to the superconformal group of sym4 show that these elds seem to be scalar
elds si, that are mixtures of the ve form eld strength on s5 and the trace of the graviton
on s5.2 to calculate the three-point functions of cpos in the framework of the ads/cft
correspondence the quadratic and cubic actions for the scalars si were found in [12]. then, it
was shown that for generic values of conformal dimensions of cpos the normalized three-point
functions computed using the actions precisely coincide with the free eld theory result (2.3).
on the other hand, as was pointed out in [28] the cubic couplings of scalars si satisfying one
of the three relations:

k1 + k2 = k3,

k2 + k3 = k1,

k3 + k1 = k2,

(2.4)

vanish, and, therefore, the three-point functions of the operators corresponding to scalars si
vanish too. thus, scalars si used in [12] do not correspond to cpos. we can explain this by
noting that the scalars si from [12] dier from the original scalars that are mixtures of the
graviton and the ve-form on s5. the original scalars si satisfy equations which depend on
higher-derivative terms. to remove the derivative terms the following eld redenition was
made in [12]

si1 = si1 + xi2,i3(cid:16)ji1i2i3si2si3 + li1i2i3asi2asi3(cid:17) .

(2.5)

namely for the scalars si the cubic couplings mentioned above vanish. because of the redef-
inition (2.5) new scalars si do not transform with respect to the superconformal group in a
proper way, and, therefore, cannot correspond to cpos.

from the computational point of view these cubic couplings have to vanish because if,
say, k1 + k2 = k3 then the three-point function (2.3) is nonsingular at x = y, but gravity
calculations with a nonvanishing on-shell bulk cubic coupling always lead to a function singular
at x = y, x = z and y = z. by the same reason we expect that n-point functions of operators
corresponding to scalars si (with an additional eld redenition which is required to remove
higher-derivative terms from the (n  1)-th order equations of motion for si) would vanish if,
say, kn = k1 +    + kn1. study of the general scalar exchange performed in [28] seems to
conrm the conclusion.
thus, scalars si (here and in what follows we omit the primes on redened elds) correspond
to properly extended cpos which have vanishing three-point functions if (2.4) is fullled.
indeed one can easily nd such an extension of cpos. namely, we dene the extended cpos
that correspond to scalars si as

oi1 = oi1 
where c i1i2i3 = k1k2k3hc i1c i2c i3i.

1

2n xi2+i3=i1

c i1i2i3oi2oi3,

(2.6)

it is not dicult to verify that in the large n limit these operators have the normalized
two-point functions (2.2), the three-point functions (2.3) if (2.4) is not satised, and vanishing

2strictly speaking this correspondence between cpos and scalars si may be valid only at linear order in
supergravity elds. the reason is that the local supersymmetry transformations of supergravity elds are
nonlinear, and, one should expect that the induced superconformal transformations are nonlinear too. thus
the original gravity elds seem to depend nonlinearly on elds with the linear transformation law.

three-point functions if (2.4) takes place. however, these operators will require a further modi-
cation to be consistent with all n-point functions computed in the framework of the ads/cft
correspondence. in general, an extended cpo is the sum of a cpo and non-chiral composite
operators which are normal-ordered products of cpos and their descendants. nevertheless, we
expect that in the large n limit an n-point function of extended cpos coincides with n-point
functions of cpos for generic values of conformal dimensions of the operators. as we will
discuss in next sections a similar modication is required for operators corresponding to other
supergravity elds.

3 equations of motion and quadratic actions

to obtain cubic couplings of two scalars si with other type iib supergravity elds it is sucient
to consider only the graviton and the four-form potential. to this end we apply the method of
[12], and use the covariant equations of motion [41, 42, 43] and the quadratic action for type
iib supergravity on ads5  s5 [40]. the equations of motion of the 4-form potential and the
graviton are

(3.7)

(3.8)

here m, n, . . . , = 0, 1, . . . 9 and we use the following notations

fm1...m5 = 5[m1am2...m5] = m1am2...m5 + 4 terms,

i.e all antisymmetrizations are with weight1. the dual forms are dened as

in the units in which the radius of s5 is set to be unity, the ads5  s5 background solution

rabcd = gacgbd + gadgbc; rab = 4gab

fabcde = abcde;

f = ,

(3.9)

where a, b, c, . . . and , , , . . . are the ads and the sphere indices respectively and ij is the
4-dimensional minkowski metric. we represent the gravitational eld and the 4-form potential
as

gm n = gm n + hm n ; am n p q = am n p q + am n p q; f = f + f.

then the self-duality equation (3.7) decomposed up to the second order looks as

here we introduced the following notations

f  f  + t (1) + t (h, f ) + t (h) = 0.

(3.14)

in eqs.(3.10-3.14) and in what follows indices are raised and lowered by means of the background
metric, and the covariant derivatives are with respect to the background metric, too.

the gauge symmetry of the equations of motion allows one to impose the de donder gauge:

ha = h() = am1m2m3 = 0;

h()  h

.

(3.15)

this gauge choice does not remove all the gauge symmetry of the theory, for a detailed discussion
of the residual symmetry see [26]. as was shown in [26], the gauge condition (3.15) implies
that the components of the 4-form potential of the form a and aa can be represented as
follows:

it is also convenient to introduce the dual 1- and 2-forms for aabcd and aabc:

a = b;

aa = 
a.

aabcd = abcdeqe;

aabc = abcdede
 .

(3.16)

(3.17)

then the solution of the rst-order self-duality equation can be written as

qa = ab, ab

 = [ab]
.

(3.18)

the quadratic action for physical elds of type iib supergravity was found in [40]. to write
down the action we need to expand elds in spherical harmonics, and make some elds redef-
inition. we begin with the scalar elds b and   h
. expanding them into a set of scalar
spherical harmonics3

(x, y) = x i1(x)y i1(y);

b(x, y) = x bi1(x)y i1(y); 2

y k = k(k + 4)y k,

and making the elds redenition [12]4

bk = sk + tk
we write the quadratic actions for the scalars si and ti in the form

k = 10ksk + 10(k + 4)tk;

and make the following shift of the gravitational elds:

4 cubic couplings of scalars

the aim of this section is to nd the cubic couplings of the scalar elds tk and k with a pair
of scalars sk. this can be achieved by nding the quadratic contribution of the scalars sk
to the equations of motion for tk and k respectively with a subsequent reconstruction of the
corresponding lagrangian vertex.

4.1 cubic couplings of tk

since tk appear as the mixture of elds k and bk we begin by considering the equations of
motion for these elds. restricting in (3.13) indices m and n to the sphere and taking into
account the gauge conditions (3.15), (3.16) we nd that einstein equation (3.13) results in

one can solve it for a
a and substituting the result in (4.32) obtain the close equation for  and
b.

according to [26] the second equation involving the elds  and b is found by considering
the component of the self-duality equation (3.10) involving one sphere and four ads indices,
and the component with ve ads indices. in our case these components read as

projecting (4.33) onto y i one nds aa1...a5. substituting then aa1...a5 as well as previously
found a
the required equation for tk is then obtained by substituting the redenition (3.19) in (4.32-
4.34) and by eliminating all the terms linear in sk. skipping all the computational details we
write down the equation for ti that is found to be of the form
(aa  (k3 + 4)(k3 + 8))ti3 = d123si1si2 + e123asi1asi2 + f123(ab)si1(ab)si2.
to remove the derivative terms we perform the appropriate redenition of ti similar to (2.5):

ti3 = ti3 + xi1,i2(cid:16)ji1i2i3si1si2 + li1i2i3asi1asi2(cid:17) .
introducing the notation a123 = r y i1y i2y i3 we quote the nal answer

where this time all the linear terms that are projected out under the projection on y() were
omitted.

equation on y() we get an equation for :

finally leaving on the r.h.s. only the contribution of the scalars sk we obtain

denotes the normalization constant of their quadratic action. taking into account that a scalar
ti3 (i3) corresponds to a ym operator o3 with the conformal weight 3 = k3+8 (3 = k3+4),
we, therefore nd correlation functions of two extended cpos with this operator. the constant

5 cubic couplings of second rank tensors with si

5.1 cubic couplings

clearly the coupling of the symmetric second rank tensor k
(ab) with a pair of scalars sk can
be found by studing the corrected equation of motion for k
(ab). the most simple way consists
however in nding the equations of motion for the eld sk corrected by the quadratic terms each
containing one eld k
(ab) is transverse
on-shell and therefore the interaction term, being in the latter case a lorentz scalar does not
contain derivatives acting on k
(ab). as a consequence the additional shift needed to get rid of
derivative terms is not required.

(ab) and sk. this is explained by noting that the eld k

since the eld sk appear as the mixture (3.19) of  and b, the equation for sk again follows

from the system (4.31)-(4.34). clearly this time eqs.(4.31) and (4.32) read as

()a

a = ((ab))ab + (ab)()ab + ab()(ab)

(5.40)

and

(mm  32) + 80b + a
a((ab)b)((ab)) + ab + (ab)()ab + ab()(ab)

a =

(5.41)

where we have used representation (3.22) for the graviton eld hab and left only the terms

contributing to the vertex under consideration. by this reason the coecients k in  = r  iy i

are reduced now to k = 4

solution into (5.41) one obtains a closed form equation for  and b.

again projecting eq.(5.40) onto y i one solves for a
the second equation for  and b follows from eqs.(4.33) and (4.34) that now acquire the

a and after substitution of the

5.2 three-point functions

denote by t i
ij the operator in sym of the conformal weight g = k + 4 that corresponds to the
ads eld (ab). to compute the three-point correlation function of this operator with extended
cpos in the boundary conformal eld theory one needs the bulk-to-boundary propagator for
the eld i
in principle this can be extracted from the momentum space results of [24].
in the case of three-point correlators it is however more convenient to deal directly with the
x-space propagator.

(ab).

recall that the linearized equations of motion for i

(ab) read as

cci

(ab) + (2  k2  4k)i

(ab) = 0, bi

(ab) = 0.

now one can easily check that the following function

0kg(, ~x)jak(  ~x)jbl(  ~x)eij,kl

projector:

c =

(5.46)

and jab(x) = ab  2 xaxb
x2 .
note that function (5.45) satises the transversality condition agab ij = 0. the normal-
ization constant g+1
g1 in (5.45) is xed by requiring the corresponding solution of (5.44) to
reproduce correctly the boundary data in the limit 0  0. in the case of vanishing ads mass
eq.(5.45) turns into the graviton bulk-to-boundary propagator [8].
having discussed the propagator for (ab) we come back to the three-point correlator that

now reads as

6 cubic couplings of two scalars si with vector elds

6.1 cubic couplings

to obtain cubic couplings of two scalars si with vectors elds we need equations of motion for
the vector elds up to the second order. the equations of motion for the vector elds 
a can
be derived from the following components of the self-duality equation

fabcd  f 
fabc  f 

abcd + t (1)
abc + t (1)

abcd + t (h, f )abcd + t (h)abcd = 0,
abc + t (h, f )abc + t (h)abc = 0.

(6.50)

(6.51)

14

from the denition of f we have

fabc = 2[a]abc,

abc = abcde(de
f 

  de
).

here we omitted all terms dependent on the components of the 4-form potential of the form
aab which are not relevant for the cubic couplings under consideration. from the denition
of the tensors t (3.11) we can easily see that

t (1)
abc = t (h, f )abc = t (h)abc = 0,

if we keep only terms which may give a contribution to the cubic couplings. thus eq.(6.51)
does not get relevant quadratic corrections, and, therefore,

taking into account eq.(6.52) and formulas (3.11) for the tensors t , one can rewrite eq.(6.50)
in the form

aabc = abcdede

in this paper we obtained the cubic couplings in type iib supergravity on ads5  s5 involving
two scalar elds si and the corresponding three-point functions by using the covariant equations
of motion and the quadratic action. since all the elds we considered correspond to operators
which are descendants of cpos, one may, in principle, derive the same results directly from
the superconformal invariance. this would require a detailed study of superconformal ward
identities in sym4 which, to our knowledge, has not been carried out yet.

in most cases to nd a cubic coupling of two scalars si with a eld f we used a corrected
equation of motion for the eld f . we saw that to get rid of higher-derivative terms we had
to make a eld redenition of the form (2.5). by this reason, a eld f corresponds not to a
descendant of a cpo, but to a properly extended operator which includes products of cpos.
in fact one can obtain the cubic couplings by using corrected equations of motion for scalars
si as it was done in the case of the graviton couplings. we have done that to derive the cubic
couplings of two scalars si with the scalars i, and with the vector elds, and we have certainly
obtained the same results (4.36) and (6.62). the fact that we derived the same vertices from
dierent equations also conrms the correct normalization of the quadratic action for type iib
supergravity [40]. it is worth noting that contrary to the graviton case considered in section 5,

18

in these cases to remove higher-derivative terms from the corrected equations of motion for si
we had to make the following redenitions of the scalars si

and

s1  s1 + j123s23 + l123as2a3

s1  s1 + j123as2v a

3 + l123abs2bv a
3 .

this implies that the extended cpos corresponding to the scalars si that were discussed in
section 2 have to depend on products of cpos and their descendants. unfortunately, the
knowledge of the three-point functions obtained in the paper does not allow one to x the
explicit form of the extended cpos uniquely.

it is worth noting that the cubic couplings of three scalars s vanish when any of the s
vanish [12]. the cubic couplings studied in this paper vanish if 3 takes special values, and in
most of the cases there are several such values of 3. since 1 and 2 have to be non-negative
the cubic couplings have no zeroes at 1 and 2. however, in all of the three-point functions
considered zeroes of the cubic couplings are cancelled by poles in the general expressions for
the three-point functions, just as in the case of the three-point functions of extended cpos.
this gives us a reason to believe that for generic values of conformal dimensions the three-point
functions obtained coincide with the three-point functions of cpos and their descendants.

the next natural step is to nd quartic couplings of scalars si, and to compute four-
point functions of extended cpos. we expect that the quartic couplings vanish if, say, k4 =
k1 +k2 +k3, because in this case there is no exchange diagram, and all contributions to the four-
point functions may be given only by the quartic couplings. however, the four-point functions
in this case are nonsingular at ~x1 = ~x2, and it seems to be impossible to reproduce such a
coordinate dependence via supergravity with a nonzero on-shell quartic coupling.

finally, it would be interesting to nd the supergravity elds that correspond to cpos, and
to compute their cubic couplings. a similar problem exists in the case of ads compactications
of 11-dimensional supergravity, where analogous cubic couplings [46, 47] also have zeroes. in
the 11-dimensional case the problem seems to be simpler because the covariant action is known.

in deriving the equations of motions for scalar elds tk and for tensor k

and p1 = 1, p2 = 2, p3 = 3  1.
(ab) one comes
across a number of integrals of scalar spherical harmonics, all of them can be reduced to a123.
introducing the concise notation f (k) = k(k + 4) we present below the corresponding formulae:

z ()y i1y i2y i3 = (cid:18) 1

analogously, when computing the interaction vertex sssv from equations of motion for
