abstract

we identify the lift to m theory of the four types of orientifold
points, and show that they involve a chiral fermion on an orbifold
xed circle. from this lift, we compute the number of normalizable
ground states for the so(n ) and sp(n ) supersymmetric quantum
mechanics with sixteen supercharges. the results agree with known
results obtained by the mass deformation method. the mass of the
orientifold is identied with the casimir energy.

1 introduction

in this note we shall be considering the supersymmetric matrix quantum
mechanics with 16 supercharges. the lagrangian is

l =

1

2g2 tr(cid:20) x i x i + 2t  

1
2

[x i, x j]2  2t i[, x i](cid:21)

(1)

where both x i, 1  i  9, and the fermionic variables , a nine dimensional
spinor, are in the adjoint representation of some lie algebra g.

the case g = su(n) is the most well studied [1, 2, 3]. this is the
lagrangian describing n d0 branes in type iia string theory (we shall
ignore the decoupled u(1) piece). the matrix theory conjecture [4] asserts
that this lagrangian, in the large n limit, describes m theory in the light
cone frame.

since m theory contains a single massless superparticle, there should be
a normalizable threshold bound state for each value of n (corresponding to
the momentum n graviton). hence m theory and especially matrix theory
predict that there should be precisely one ground state for g = su(n), i.e.
the witten index should be 1. this prediction was tested and conrmed by
a detailed calculation of the witten index [5, 6].

the calculation of the witten index for an arbitrary lie group was per-
formed by kac and smilga [7]. their analysis, to be reviewed in section 2,
uses the mass deformation method, due to porrati and rozenberg [8]. we
consider their results for the cases g = sp(n), so(n) where they can be
written in terms of a partition function

xn =1

dn qn =

yr

(1 + qr),

(2)

where r runs over even/odd positive integers for sp(n/2)/so(n) respec-
tively, and dn is the supersymmetric index. our goal is to provide an m the-
ory explanation for the results of [7], or alternatively, an independent deriva-
tion of their result without making the assumption on which the method of
mass deformation hinges.

in section 3 we provide a realization of this lagrangian with g = sp(n),
so(n) as a system of n d0 branes of type iia string theory moving in
the background of one of the four types of orientifold points, o0+, o0,

go0, and do0. we claim that these backgrounds lift to m theory orbifolds

on r9/z2  s1. we argue that the results of [7] can be phenomenologically
reproduced by postulating a chiral fermion living on the xed circle (the
projection of the xed circle onto r9/z2 is the xed point at the origin).
periodic (r) boundary conditions on the circle correspond to the sp groups
while anti-periodic (ns) boundary conditions correspond to so groups.

independent evidence for this proposal was given by the results of das-
gupta and mukhi [9] , who argued, by an analysis of gravitational anomalies
of m theory on t9/z2 (with (0,16) supersymmetry in 1+1 dimensions), that
the orbifold xed line carries a chiral fermion in a supersymmetry singlet, in
beautiful agreement with our phenomenology.

it remains to explain how the dierent boundary conditions on periodicity
r/ns correlate with the group family sp/so. following a discussion in
[10], we compare the known masses of the o0 orientifolds with the r/ns
casimir energy in m theory and nd complete agreement. we nd that o0+

and do0, which both give an sp(n) group, are related through the ground

state degeneracy in the ramond sector. thus in addition to rederiving the
counting of bound states, we nd a physical picture for the various orientifold
points.
it would be nice to get an m theory picture also for the discrete
torsions of [11].

we conclude with remarks on the connection to matrix theory in section
5. matrix theory compactication on t9/z2 was also considered in [12],
where results consistent with ours were obtained.

2 a review of the mass deformation method

in this section we will review the results and arguments of [7]. we can think
of the quantum mechanics (1) as a dimensional reduction from 4 dimensions.
using four dimensional n = 1 language, the matter content is a vector
multiplet with 3 chiral multiplets, i, 1  i  3 in the adjoint representation,
and the superpotential is

w = gijk fabc a

i b

j c

k

(3)

where  is the antisymmetric tensor and f are the structure constants of g.
following [8] the superpotential is deformed by a mass term

w = m a

i a

i

(4)

the idea is that it is relatively easy to nd zero energy solutions to the
deformed lagrangian. one needs to solve for the d and f equations, thereby
reducing the problem to algebra, and then count the number of solutions.
these vacua break the gauge group completely. for large m all degrees
of freedom are very massive and the quantum wavefunction is concentrated
around the classical solution, and so is normalizable. as we take the limit
m  0 these wavefunctions deform continuously, move towards the center
at  = 0 and become wider. if one assumes (without proof) that all these
states remain normalizable in the limit, then we have a count of the number
of bound states which is easier than a computation of the witten index.
for su(n) one gets the correct result, and our independent derivation for
sp/so suggests further that this assumption is valid.

the f and d equations are

ijk f abc a

i b
f abc a
i

j  m/g c
k
j = 0.

b

(5)

(6)

to these we add the condition that the vevs break the gauge group com-
pletely, namely that the normalizer in g of the subgroup spanned by the i
is trivial. these equations can be interpreted [13] to describe embeddings of
sl(2) in the (complexied) group g which have a trivial centralizer.

for the unitary groups there is a unique solution to these equations, as
expected. the solution can be identied with the n dimensional represen-
tation of su(2) (or sl(2)).
in general the question can be translated in
mathematical terms to a classication of distinguished markings for a lie
algebra. the results are

a) for so(n) the index is the number of partitions of n into distinct

odd parts.

b) for sp(n) the index is the number of partitions of 2n into distinct

even parts (sp(1) = su(2)).

the solution corresponding to a given partition can be identied with the
reducible representation of su(2) with the given partition into irreducible
components.

anticipating ourselves, we note that the number of bound states, dn can

be conveniently coded in a partition function z = p

n =1 qn dn

zso(n ) =

(1 + q2r1),

(7)

yr=1

zsp(n ) =

yr=1

(1 + qr).

(8)

we realize that phenomenologically, these partition functions exactly rep-
resent a chiral fermion on a circle. for so groups we have half integer moding
(ns), while for sp it is integral (r).

3 physical realization

in order to get a physical realization of the results of [7] we should nd
a physical system for the lagrangian (1) with g = sp(n), so(n). as
sp(n)  su(2n), so(n)  su(n) we start with a system of n d0 branes
that carries an su(n) group, and use an orientifold point to project onto
the required group.

3.1 orientifolds

let us review briey the properties of orientifold planes in string theory.
an orientifold plane (op plane) is a background for string theory where
we mod out by reversing the coordinates transverse to the op plane and
reverse the string orientation at the same time. this background has 16
supersymmetries. to specify the action on open strings one needs to x the
action on the chan-paton indices, and there are two ways to do that. the
two kinds of o planes are called o+ and o, and the corresponding open
string gauge groups are sp and so. an op plane carries rr charge and
tension according to q = t = 2p5. this is determined by looking at a
string diagram on a test dp brane.

actually, one can distinguish a total of 4 kinds of orientifolds as follows.
from here on we shall specialize to o0s. (a similar discussion on this point
for the case of orientifold 3-planes may be found in [11].) the o0 point
is surrounded by an rp8. we can introduce two z2 valued wilson lines,
denoted b and c, corresponding to nontrivial gauge congurations of the bn s
two-form and a crr 5-form (the dual of the 3-form). the four types of
orientifold planes dier in the values of (b, c). b = 0 gives so groups and
b = 1 gives sp groups, from the ordinary coupling of bn s to the worldsheet.
let us enumerate the dierent o0 points and their properties. our nor-
malization for the rr charge is that a d0 with an image has charge +1,

4

while a d0 stuck at the orientifold has charge + 1
2 .

the o0 has a trivial value in both z2s, (b, c) = (0, 0), gives an so(2n)

gauge group and carries a rr gauge eld charge  1
32 .

+ 1

32 and give sp(n) groups.

the o0+ has (b, c) = (1, 0) and the do0 has (1, 1). both carry rr charge
the go0 has (b, c) = (0, 1), has a d0 stuck on it and thus carries a rr

32 and gives so(2n + 1) groups.

charge + 15

in summary, branes which realize an sp(n) gauge theory have rr charge
n + 1
32 and branes which realize an so(n) gauge theory have rr charge
2  1
n
32.

3.2 a phenomenological fermion

the lagrangian (1) with so(n) and sp(n) gauge groups can therefore be
realized by n d0 branes at an orientifold point. to analyze this system, we
need its m theory interpretation.

when we go from type iia to m theory, we have an extra circle. the
orientifold r9/z2 in iia will then lift to a space r9/z2  s1. we will assume
that the z2 does not act on the s1 factor (this assumption will be justied
in the next section, and also by the consistency of our analysis).hence there
is a singular s1 at the origin of the r9 coordinates.

suppose there was a eld living on the singular orientifold circle. this
eld can then be decomposed into momentum modes along this circle. a
mode with mode number n along the circle is interpreted in type iia as a
bound state of n d0 branes sitting at the orientifold point. we therefore
have a bound state for each allowed mode.

now suppose that there are a total of n d0 branes in the system. we can
partition this number n into any number of pieces n = n1 + n2 +    + nm.
we can then form a state which is a m-particle state, the rst particle being
a bound state of n1 d0 branes, the second particle being a bound state of
n2 d0 branes, and so on. these states are localized in r9 and hence are
normalizable. hence it contributes to the witten index. the number of
ground states is then the number of partitions of n. 4

4it is worthwhile to explain why we do not get an analogous partitioning in the case
of su (n ) gauge theories. the point is that these bound states in the su (n ) case are
interpreted as 11 dimensional gravitons. a state with many gravitons has a relative wave

5

however, [7] found that we actually need the partitions to be distinct
integers. this has a natural interpretation: the state at the orientifold point
should be fermionic.

furthermore, these states only exist if we have d0 branes bound to the
orientifold point, and not anti-d0 branes, because a state with an orien-
tifold point and anti-d0 branes is not supersymmetric. this implies that the
fermion can have only positive mode number i.e. it must be a chiral fermionic
eld.

what about the multiplet structure? a standard d0 brane is a bps
state and breaks 16 of the 32 supersymmetries of type iia. these broken
supersymmetries acting on the d0 brane generate a 28 = 256 dimensional
multiplet of states: the graviton multiplet in 11 dimensions.

here however, we have a d0 brane along with an orientifold point. the
orientifold point preserves the same supersymmetries as a d0 brane. how-
ever, the remaining supercharges are not broken, as they can no longer be
dened in the asymptotic space of the orientifold5. there is therefore no
multiplet of d0 brane states in this theory; the d0 brane is a supersymmetry
singlet. (the fact that the d0 brane in type iia on t9/z2 is a supersymme-
try singlet was also pointed out in [14].)

we have therefore been led to postulate a chiral fermion living on the
orientifold singularity. this fermion is a singlet under the preserved super-
symmetries.

the hilbert space of this single chiral fermionic eld can be constructed

straightforwardly.

the fermion on the s1 can either be in the r or ns sector i.e. it can be

periodic or antiperiodic, respectively.

in the ns sector, the fermion can be expanded into half-integer modes
. these act on the vacuum denoted by |0i.
for total mode number k  z/2 , the hilbert space is the set of states
2).
given by bn1+ 1
here the ni are distinct by the exclusion principle. one should recall here
that the mode number actually counts the number of physical d0 branes.
that is, a state with n + 1
2 mode number corresponds to 2n + 1 half physical
in the so(n ) and

function which is a plane wave and is therefore not normalizable.
sp (n ) cases, there is no relative wave function since all states live at a point in r9.

branes. k can be either integral or half integral depending on whether m
is even or odd. for the m even case we can rewrite the above equation as
n = (2k) = (2n1 + 1) + (2n2 + 1) +    (2nm + 1). for the m odd case we can
rewrite the equation as n = (2k + 1) = (2n1 + 1) + (2n2 + 1) +    (2nm + 1).
hence the number of states with n half d0 branes is the number of
partitions of n into distinct odd integers. note that the states are always
built from an odd number of half d0 branes.

this is identical to the spectrum found by kac and smilga for so(n)

gauge theories.

the r-sector is very similar. the new thing here is that there is a zero

mode b0. accordingly there are two vacuum states: |0i and b0|0i.

we can build the hilbert space by acting by any distinct combination of

bn. the hilbert space at mode number k is then the set of states bn1bn2    bnm|0i
and bn1bn2    bnmb0|0i. here again ni are distinct and k = n1 + n2 +    nm.
which we rewrite in physical d0 brane number as n = 2k = 2n1 + 2n2 +
   2nm.

the number of states in each vacuum sector is then the number of parti-
tions of n into distinct even integers. this is identical to the spectrum found
by kac and smilga for sp(n) gauge theories.

furthermore, we have two vacuum states. these presumably correspond
to the two types of sp(n) orientifold planes, the case with no b0 state corre-
sponds to the familiar o+ point and the case with the b0 state corresponds

to the more exotic do0 point.

4 more on m theory

we can actually nd conrmation of these ideas through a remarkable analy-
sis of dasgupta and mukhi [9], who considered compactications of m theory
on t9/z2. this theory has (0,16) supersymmetry in 1+1 dimensions.

let us review their analysis. eleven dimensional supergravity contains
128 bosonic degrees of freedom and 128 fermionic partners. one dimension-
ally reduces on t9/z2 and identies the untwisted sector, which is made of a
gravity multiplet and 128 dimensionally reduced scalars accompanied by 128
right moving fermionic partners. these scalars and fermions are arranged in
16 supermultiplets of (0,16) supersymmetry in 1+1 dimensions. this matter
content is anomalous. computation shows that the gravity multiplet has

7

3 times the anomaly of the 16 matter supermultiplets.
in total we need
128  (1 + 3) = 512 left moving fermions to cancel the anomaly. this suggests
that each orbifold line has a left moving fermion on it, since there are 29
xed points for the orbifold action (being left moving means that it can be
excited without destroying the right moving supersymmetry).

this is in exact agreement with what we nd.
we can furthermore (following [10]) compute the ground state energy of
this compactication. this is nonzero, because of the casimir energy of the
chiral fermions and chiral bosons.

24r

we need to know for this calculation the casimir energy of
a) a periodic boson:  1
24r
1
b) a periodic fermion:
c) an antiperiodic fermion:  1
48r
now the right moving elds are in supermultiplets, and do not contribute
to the casimir energy. among the left-movers, in the ns case, there are 128
periodic bosons and 512 antiperiodic fermions. the total energy is then  16
r .
since there are 512 xed points, the energy per xed point is then  1
32r . a
similar calculation in the r sector yields an energy per xed point equal to
1
32r .

this is in precise agreement with the masses of o0 and o0+ orientifold
points. note that there is a bulk contribution to the mass,  1
96r , from the
untwisted sector which is common to all kinds of orientifold points, while the
twisted fermion contribution diers.

one of the corollaries of our construction is that all the orientifold points
must be realized in m theory as a r9/z2  s1 space. for suppose that the z2
action did not leave the s1 invariant. there are two options: the z2 can act
as a shift, or it can act as a reection. in the rst case, the resulting space
is smooth, with no xed points, and there is no natural way to introduce a
new eld. in the second case, there are two singular points, not a singular
line, and we cannot introduce a one- dimensional eld. this only leaves the
case that the z2 does not act on the s1.

5 matrix theory

the preceding discussion leads to a matrix theory realization of m theory
on the space r9/z2. explicitly, we nd that so(n)/sp(n) gauge theories

8

with 16 supercharges describe dlcq m theory on r9/z2 with a fermion in
the ns/r sector respectively. in this interpretation, the s1 is a light-cone
direction.

a related proposal for matrix theory on t9/z2 was put forward in [12].
the gauge group considered there was so(32). (it is not possible to take
arbitrary n in this case, due to charge conservation in 1 + 1 dimensions.)
the authors were able to show via parton scattering that the charge of the
orientifold was  1

32 , in agreement with our results.
