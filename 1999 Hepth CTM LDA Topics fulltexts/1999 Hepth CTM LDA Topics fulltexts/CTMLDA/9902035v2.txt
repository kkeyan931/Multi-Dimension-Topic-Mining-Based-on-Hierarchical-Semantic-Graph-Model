abstract

using s-wave and large n approximation the one-loop eective action for
2d dilaton coupled scalars and spinors which are obtained by spherical reduc-
tion of 4d minimal matter is found. quantum eective equations for reduced
einstein gravity are written. their analytical solutions corresponding to 4d
kantowski-sachs (ks) universe are presented. for quantum-corrected ein-
stein gravity we get non-singular ks cosmology which represents 1) quantum-
corrected ks cosmology which existed on classical level or 2)purely quantum
solution which had no classical limit. the analogy with nariai bh is briey
mentioned. for purely induced gravity (no einstein term) we found general
analytical solution but all ks cosmologies under discussion are singular. the
corresponding equations of motion are reformulated as classical mechanics
problem of motion of unit mass particle in some potential v .

1 introduction

it is quite common belief that two-dimensional dilatonic gravity may be useful
only as toy model for the study of realistic 4d gravity, especially in quantum
regime (for a review of quantum gravity, see, for example, ref.[1]). however,
it is quite well-known (for example, see ref.[2]) that spherical reduction of
einstein gravity leads to some specic dilatonic gravity (for its most general
model, see ref.[3]). on the same time, spherical reduction of minimal 4d
matter leads to 2d dilaton coupled matter.

the conformal anomaly for 2d conformally invariant, dilaton coupled
scalar has been found in refs.[4, 5, 6, 7] and the correspondent anomaly
induced eective action has been found in refs.[5, 6, 8, 9]. the same calcu-
lation for 2d and 4d dilaton coupled spinor has been presented recently in
[10]. using such anomaly induced eective action (i.e. working in s-wave
and large n approximation) and adding it to reduced einstein action one
may study four-dimensional kantowski-sachs (ks) quantum cosmology [11]
in consistent way as it was done in refs.[12] (for a discussion of 2d dilatonic
quantum cosmology, see for example [13, 14, 15, 12]). (note that using similar
methods the inducing of wormholes in the early universe has been recently
investigated in ref. [16] conrming such inducing).

in the (mainly numerical) study of refs.[12] it was found that most of
ks cosmologies under investigation are singular at the initial stage of the
universe evolution. the interesting question is : can we construct (non)
singular ks quantum cosmologies using purely analytical methods?

in the present work we try to answer to this question. using the analogy
between ks cosmology and schwarzschild bh (or its generalizations) after
the interchange of time and radial coordinates (see [11, 17]) we found the
particular solution of quantum equations of motion analytically. this solu-
tion represents non-singular ks cosmology (expanding universe with always
non-zero radius) which comes from schwarzschild-de sitter (or -anti de sit-
ter) bh after interchange of time and radial coordinates. for purely induced
gravity (when cosmology is dened completely by quantum eects of matter)
we present general analytical solution of quantum equations of motion. un-
fortunately, in this case all found ks quantum cosmologies are singular. we
also reformulate last problem as classical mechanics problem re-writing the
system of equations as describing the motion of unit mass particle in some
potential v .

2 anomaly induced eective action and non-

singular ks cosmology

we will start from the action of einstein gravity with n minimal real scalars
and m majorana fermions

where i and i are real scalars and majorana spinors, respectively. in order
to apply large n approach n and m are considered to be large, n, m 
1, g and  are gravitational and cosmological constants. note that we
do not discuss the possible topological restrictions to spinors ( like twisted
spinors,etc) as it does not matter in our discussion, the anomaly induced
eective action will be the same.

we now assume the spherically symmetric spacetime:

ds2 = g dxdx + e2d2

(2)

where ,  = 0, 1, g and  depend only from x0 = t, and d2 corresponds
to two-dimensional sphere.

the action (1) reduced according to (2) takes the form

note that the fermion degrees of freedom after reduction are twice of original
ones. in the spherical reduction  is repalaced by  ( + ) but the
second term does not contribute to the action.
working in large n and s-wave approximation one can calculate the quan-
tum correction to sred (eective action). using 2d conformal anomaly for
dilaton coupled scalar and dilaton coupled spinor, one can nd the anomaly
induced eective action. in the case of dilaton absence such induced eective

action gives the complete eective action which is valid for an arbitrary two-
dimensional background. in the presence of dilaton as above the complete
eective action consists of two pieces. first one is induced eective action
which is given actually for any background but with accuracy up to confor-
mally invariant functional. the second piece of it, i.e. conformally invariant
functional can not be found in closed form in case of scalars. nevertheless, one
can nd it ,using standard methods as some expansion, say on the curvatures.
we use schwinger-de witt technique to calculate it. we keep only leading
part of such expansion, for more detail and explanation,see refs.[6, 8, 10].
then the eective action may be written in the following form[6, 8, 10]

w =

note that numerical coecient in front of log term does not matter as it
can be changed by rescaling of . as it was shown in ref.[10] dilaton coupled
spinors do not give contribution to this term, at least in leading order of sd
expansion. the anomaly induced eective action for dilaton coupled spinor
is found also in appendix following ref.[10].

this equation may be used to determine t0 from the initial condition, it

subsequent analysis.

it is often convienient to use the cosmological time  instead of t, where

the metric is given by

ds2 = d 2 + e2dr2 + e2d2.
since we have d = edt, we obtain t = e and 2

we now consider a special solution for eqs.(5), (6) and (7) corresponding
to the (wick-rotated) nariai solution [18], where  is a constant :  = 0.
then the eqs.(6) and (7) can be rewritten as follows:

the sign  in (14) should be + if we require the solution coincides with the
classical one e20 = 1
 in the classical limit of n, m  0. on the other
hand, in the solution with the  sign, we have e20  (3n +2m )g

the classical limit. therefore the second solution does not correspond to any
classical solution but the solution is generated by the quantum eects.

note that 4d curvature r4 = r0 +2e20 becomes a constant. it should be also
noted that the solution exists for the both cases: of positive  and negative
. in eq.(16), the + sign corresponds to the classical limit (n, m  0). in
the limit, we obtain r0  2 (r4  4). on the other hand, the  sign
in eq.(16) corresponds to the solution with  sign in (14) generated by the
quantum eect. in the classical limit for the solution, the curvature r0 in
2(n +m )g  +. therefore from (15), we nd that e2
(16) diverges as r0 
vanish: (note that r0 > 0 in the limit) : e2 = 4(n +m )gc
3 cos2(tc)  0. therefore by
using (2), we obtain the following metric near the classical limit:

it should be interesting to consider the limit   0, where there is no
de sitter or anti-de sitter solution at the classical level. in the limit, we can
have a nite solution:

this tells that the nariai space can be generated by the quantum eect even
if  = 0.

the obtained solution (15) (and (17)) might appear to have a singularity

in fact the scalar curvature r0 in (16) is always constant. if we change the
conformal time coordinate t by the cosmological time  in (9), we nd that

when cos2(cid:16)tc(cid:17) = 0 (for r0 > 0 case) but the singularity is apparent one.
the time cos2(cid:16)tc(cid:17) = 0 corresponds to innite future or past.
in the following, we assume r0 > 0 for simplicity. r0 < 0 case can be eas-
ily obtained by changing the constant c  c and analytically continuing
2 (cid:17)

solutions. we now change the time-coordinate by  = q 2
.

then the time cos2(cid:16)tc(cid:17) = 0 (tc =  
2 ) corresponds to  = . using

(19)

here e20 is given in (14). if we assume r has the periodicity of 2, the
metric describes non-singular kantowski-sachs universe, whose topology is
s1 s2. the radius of the s2 is constant but the radius of s1 has a minimum
when  = 0 and increases exponentially with the absolute value of  .
hence we found non-singular ks cosmology which exists on classical level
and which also exists on quantum level (as quantum corrected ks cosmol-
ogy). this metric may be considered as the one obtained from schwarzchild-
de sitter (nariai) bh (for positive cosmological constant) [18] and from
schwarzchild-anti-de sitter bh (for negative cosmological constant). to
make the correspondence one has to interchange time and radial coordinates
assuming corresponding wick-rotation. it is very interesting that the last
case (of negative cosmological constant) may be relevant to ads/cft [19]

correspondence. we also found non-singular ks universe which does not
have the classical limit and which is completely induced by quantum eects
(even in the case of zero cosmological constant). hence we obtained expand-
ing universe with the radius which is never zero. this cosmology maybe
interesting in frames of inationary universe as it can describe some sub-
stage of inationary universe where there is eective expansion only along
one (or two) space coordinates.

3 induced gravity and singular ks quantum

cosmology

let us discuss now the situation when we live in the regime where quan-
tum (non-local) anomaly induced eective action gives major contribution
to equations of motion. in other words, quantum cosmology is dened com-
pletely by quantum eects (eective gravity theory which at some point
makes transition to classical gravity). as we will see in this case the equa-
tions of motion admit the analytical solutions which lead to singular ks
cosmology.

we consider purely induced gravity, i.e. n, m   case. then the
einstein action can be dropped away. for this case, the eld equations have
the form

r = 2 (cid:16)e2  + 3 2  2   + 2  2  + (cid:17) .

r  2e20|  |2(n + 2

3 m) .

eq.(35) can be compared with the system of one particle with unit mass
and in the potential v () in the classical mechanical system when the total
energy vanishes. since the kinetic energy 1
2 ()2 is positive,  can have its
value in the region where v () is negative. therefore the following cases can
be allowed:

1) 0 >  >  (i2 > 0). in this case, the region with  <  and the region
with  >  are allowed. the region  >  would correspond to the
expanding universe but there is always a curvature singularity of (37)
at  + a =  ( = ).

2)  =  (i2 > 0). in this case, from the solution (38), we nd that there is
a singularity when  = 0 coming from (38). in case of the expanding
universe (+ sign in (38)), (34) tells  = 0, i.e.,  is a constant as in
nariai space [18]. on the other hand, in case of the shrinking universe
( sign in (38)), from (39), we nd there is a curvature singularity
when   0 =  n +m

ea besides  = 0.

3) 0 >  >  (i2 > 0). the region  + a <  and the region  + a >  are
allowed. in the latter case, the shrinking universe turns to expand at
 + a =  ( = ) but there is always a curvature singularity coming
from the singularity as explained arround eq.(41) at  + a = 0 ( = )
when the the universe is shrinking ( < ) if i1 > 0 or when the
universe is expanding ( > ) if i1 < 0.

4) 0 =  >  (i1 = 0). when i2 < 0, the region  <  + a < 0 can be
allowed. on the other hand, when i2 > 0, the region  + a <  and
the region  + a >  are allowed. in the case of  + a > , however,
we nd from (44) that there is a curvature singularity when  + a  0
(   = ).

5)  > 0 >  (i2 < 0). only the region  <  <  can be allowed. there

is no any solution describing the expanding universe in this case.

as it follows from above analysis in purely induced gravity case when
expanding universe is constructed due to matter quantum eects one always
gets the curvature singularity like in the case discussed in ref.[12]. neverthe-
less, it is remarkable that equations of motion in this case admit analytical
solutions.

in summary, using s-wave and large n approximation we studied gravi-
tational equations of motion with quantum corrections. the analytical solu-
tions representing (non) singular ks cosmology are found. in this derivation,
for non-singular ks universe the analogy with nariai bh (after interchange
of time and radial coordinates) is used. in the same way, starting from more
complicated multiple horizon bhs with constant curvature one can nd other
families of non-singular quantum cosmologies.

a anomaly induced eective action for dila-

ton coupled spinor

in this appendix, we present the conformal anomaly for 2d dilaton coupled
spinors (it was derived in [10]). we start from 2d dilaton coupled spinor
lagrangian:

l = gf () 

where  is 2d majorana spinor, f () is an arbitrary function and  is dilaton.
let us make now the following classical transformation of background

eld g:

(47)
then it is easy to see that (x)  f ()(x) and in terms of new classical
metric we obtain usual, non-coupled with dilaton (minimal) lagrangian for
2d spinor:

g  f2()g .

(46)

(48)

l = qg  .

then we get the following conformal anomaly for dilaton coupled majorana
spinor (46):

integrating the anomaly, we nd the anomaly induced eective action w in
the covariant, non-local form [10]:

that gives anomaly induced eective action for dilaton coupled spinors. it
is interesting that adding this w to classical part of cghs model[20] we
get rst model[21] where last term in w has been introduced by hands in
ref.[21]. dilaton coupled quantum spinor gives the natural realization of rst
model.
