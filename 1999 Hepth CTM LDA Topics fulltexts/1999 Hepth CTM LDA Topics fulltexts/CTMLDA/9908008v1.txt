using n = 2 landau-ginzburg theories, we examine the recent conjectures

relating the dsu (3) wzw modular invariants, nite subgroups of su (3) and

gorenstein singularities. all isolated three-dimensional gorenstein singularities
do not appear to be related to any known landau-ginzburg theories, but we
present some curious observations which suggest that the su (3)n/su (2)u (1)
kazama-suzuki model may be related to a deformed geometry of c3/zzn+3 
zzn+3. the toric resolution diagrams of those particular singularities are also

seen to be classifying the diagonal modular invariants of the dsu (3)n as well as
the dsu (2)n+1 wzw models.

1 introduction

study of integrable lattice models has previously led physicists to speculate a possible
connection between the nite subgroups of su(3) and the modular invariants of the

dsu(3) wzw models. in particular, it has been observed in [3] that the representation
theory graphs of the zzn  zzn nite subgroups are closely related to the diagonal a-
modular invariants of the dsu(3) wzw models at level (n  1). such a relation, if

it exists, would not be an absolute surprise to those who are conversant with the
ubiquitous a-d-e classications of the nite subgroups of su(2), modular invariants

of the dsu(2) wzw, two-dimensional gorenstein singularities, and n = 2 minimal

models [1, 9, 14, 17]. the current situation for su(3), however, is not nearly as
good as that for su(2). that is, unlike the case of su(2), where the a-d-e dynkin
diagrams precisely classify both the modular invariants and the nite subgroups, the

graphs characterizing the dsu(3) modular invariants are not quite the same as those

encoding the irreducible representations of the nite subgroups of su(3); the former
graphs appear to be subgraphs of the latter with many lines and nodes deleted. in [3],
it has thus been suggested that there should be a way of truncating the representation

theory graphs of the su(3) nite subgroups in order to reproduce the dsu(3) modular

invariant graphs, but no particular algorithm has yet been put forth satisfactorily.

in this paper, we provide evidences for a slightly dierent correspondence using
geometry as our main tool. the essential motivation for our study stems from the
fact that a lot of information about a given nite subgroup   su(n) are encoded
in the geometry of cn / and its resolution2  : m  cn /. in particular, string
theory predicts the hodge numbers and the euler characteristics of the resolution3
of such gorenstein orbifolds in terms of group theoretic data. it has subsequently
led mathematicians to conjecture that there exists a so-called mckays correspon-
dence between the irreducible representation ring of a nite subgroup   su(n)
and the cohomology ring of the resolved manifold m, with certain maps between two
ring structures. thus, gorenstein singularities are intrinsically connected to nite
subgroups of su(n). one of the merits of string theory is that (super)-algebra and
geometry often play complementary roles both in its quantization and compactica-
tions. more precisely, certain non-linear sigma-models on calabi-yau (cy) manifolds
admit purely algebraic descriptions in terms of n = 2 superconformal eld theories.
therefore, since gorenstein orbifolds are intrinsically related to nite groups, we could

perhaps understand the vague connection between the modular invariants of dsu(n)

2throughout the paper, we use the standard mathematical notions of resolution, deformation,

and their combination as means of desingularizations.

3assuming that the crepant resolutions actually exist, that is.

wzw and the nite subgroups of su(n) if we could nd a superconformal eld the-
ory (scft) which both encodes the wzw theory and describes certain gorenstein
singularities. this line of thinking furnishes the main theme in the work of ooguri
and vafa [17] and in the present paper: geometry and its scft description can pro-
vide a possible explanation for the mysterious connections among the coset models
of the integrable lattices4, the wzw modular invariants and the nite subgroups.

we will restrict ourselves to the case in which the relevant group is su(3) and the
scft is a landau-ginzburg formulation of the n = 2 kazama-suzuki models. we
will address two complementary questions: given a three-dimensional gorenstein
singularity, is there a lg theory which describes the non-linear sigma-model on this

geometry and also encodes the dsu(3) modular invariants in some way? and given

a lg theory, is there a corresponding geometry? at rst sight, it appears that
the singularities must be isolated in order to be related to the well-known landau-
ginzburg formalism, and we are consequently led to search for all isolated gorenstein
singularities. we nd that the requirement of isolated singularity imposes a strong
constraint on the possible types of three-dimensional quotient singularities. it turns
out that isolated gorenstein singularities in three-dimensions cannot be realized as a
hypersurface in c4 but only as complete intersections in higher dimensions, implying
that they do not correspond to simple lg theories of the known type. in the opposite
direction of pursuit, we face a similar problem; since lg superpotentials have isolated
singularities, there is no direct way of relating the lg theory to a nite subgroup and
its associated orbifold. we thus take an indirect approach to the problem of relating,
if it is really possible, the lg theory to nite subgroups of su(3). what we are
able to do is to look for the dening signatures of the lg theory in the resolved
geometry of various gorenstein orbifolds; in particular, we look for the chiral ring
structure in the cohomology of the resolved manifold. as a result, we observe some
peculiar matchings between the su(3)n/su(2)u(1) kazama-suzuki models at level
n and the resolutions of c3/zzn+3  zzn+3 gorenstein orbifolds which actually have
non-isolated singularities. note that the level is dierent from the conjecture in [3].
we also observe that the toric resolution of the c3/zzn+3  zzn+3 gorenstein orbifold
yields a natural connection of the zzn+3  zzn+3 nite subgroups to the modular
invariants. for example, the compact exceptional divisors, which are degree 6 del

4we will not explicitly address the integrable lattice models in this paper, but it should be possible
to relate our discussion to those cases which are, in many aspects, non-supersymmetric cousins of the
kazama-suzuki theories. we note that both the kazama-suzuki models and the continuum limit

of the integrable lattice models based on dsu (3) diagonal modular invariants can serve as minimal

matters for the (super) w3-algebra. furthermore, both of them are related to toda and ane toda
theories under relevant perturbations.

pezzo surfaces5, are in one-to-one correspondence with the chiral primary operators
of the kazama-suzuki model, and their intersections reproduce the verlinde algebra

there are also non-compact exceptional divisors which are ruled surfaces and which

and the associated diagonal modular invariant graphs of dsu(3)n wzw at level n.
seem to classify the diagonal dsu(2)n+1 modular invariants. we give an explanation
of these observations by noting that zzn+3  zzn+3 has three zzn+3  su(2)  su(3)
subgroups whose quotient singularities are resolved by the ruled surfaces. thus, our
approach, if correct, seems to give us a canonical way of identifying the relevant

elements of the zzn+3  zzn+3 subgroups with the dsu(3) modular invariants. namely,

those non-trivial elements not contained in a subgroup of su(2)  su(3) are in
one-to-one correspondence with the del pezzo surfaces and two-cycles in the resolved

manifold, and they are the ones that classify the dsu(3)n modular invariants. it thus

seems that there is a mysterious connection between n = 2 scft and generally
non-isolated three-dimensional gorenstein singularities yet to be made more precise.
this paper is organized as follows: we begin by discussing what kind of subgroups
  su(3) leads to an isolated singularity c3/ and the embedding of the resulting
geometry as ane varieties in cn. we argue that none of these cases leads to known
lg theories. 3 initiates the opposite view point and discusses the relevant details of

the dsu(3) wzw and the su(3)n/su(2)u(1) kazama-suzuki model. the following

section 4 is a search for a corresponding geometry of the kazama-suzuki model. we
analyze the blow-up geometry in both toric and algebraic geometry set-ups and show
that the diagonal modular invariant graphs appear in the resolution diagrams. the
paper concludes by addressing some open questions and puzzles. in appendix, we
prove a few facts regarding the three-dimensional isolated gorenstein singularities.

notations:
we will adhere to the following conventions throughout this paper: we dene the
n (1, 2, 3)  zzn on c3 by (z1, z2, z3) 7 (q1z1, q2z2, q3z3) where
action of  := 1
q = exp(2i/n). by h 1
n(1, 2, 3)i, we mean a cyclic group of order n generated
n (1, 2, 3). the subscripts in su(3)n/su(2)  u(1) and dsu(n)n
by the element 1
represent the levels of the kac-moody algebras. finally, by dimension, we always
mean complex dimension.

5by a degree 6 del pezzo surface, we mean ip2 blown up at three points.

2 sigma-models and landau-ginzburg theories

2.1

isolated singularities and lg superpotentials

it is by now a familiar concept6 that certain calabi-yau (cy) sigma-models ad-
mit equivalent descriptions in terms of exactly solvable n = 2 superconformal eld
theories (scft). traditionally, such an equivalence has usually involved compact
projective cy manifolds and n = 2 a-d-e minimal models. in [17], the considera-
tion has been extended to ale spaces which are non-compact two-dimensional cy
manifolds. the natural question to ask then is whether one can extend the situation
to three-dimensional non-compact cy manifolds obtained from desingularizations of
gorenstein singularities7.

let us rst briey review the essential ideas of [17] and see how to generalize
them. the main ingredient is the fact that all ale spaces can be represented as
hypersurfaces in c3, and one can use the dening equations of those hypersurfaces
as superpotentials in landau-ginzburg (lg) theories. for example, the singular
limit of the an ale space, which is isomorphic to c2/zzn+1, can be represented as
x2 + y2 + zn+1 = 0. the corresponding superpotential is then

w = wn1 + x2 + y2 + zn+1

(2.1)

where  is a moduli parameter and the power of w has been chosen8 to yield the

correct total central charge c = 2 of the sigma-model on the ale space. treating w
as a parameter, we see that (2.1) describes a deformation of the an singularity. the
claim is that in the degenerating limit,   0, the above scft captures the physics
of string theory on a singular ale space.

in a similar spirit, we now search for a possible gorenstein orbifold in 3-dimensions
whose dening equation can be used as a part of the lg superpotential. more pre-
cisely, we look for a desingularization of some quotient space of the form c3/, where
 is a discrete subgroup of su(3), whose certain degenerating limit admits a descrip-
tion in terms of a tensor product of n = 2 kazama-suzuki models [12]. one of the
criteria for the superpotentials appearing in landau-ginzburg theories is that they

6one of the rst examples that have been studied describes the quintic in ip4 as a tensor product

of a4 minimal models and plays an important role in mirror symmetry.

7for an elementary introduction to these terminologies, we refer the reader to [9].
8recall that the central charge of a landau-ginzburg theory with a superpotential w (x1, . . . , xk)
i=1(1  2qi), where qi is the u (1) charge of the eld xi. as usual, we dene

is given by c = 3pk

3c = c.

4

must have only isolated singularities9. thus, if we insist upon a naive generalization
of the correspondence between the superpotential and the hypersurface equation, we
want to consider only those orbifolds with isolated gorenstein singularities. inciden-
tally in three-dimensions, it turns out that the requirement of isolated singularity
imposes a very restrictive constraint on the possible types of orbifolds. indeed in [23],
yau and yu prove the following theorem:

theorem 2.1 the three-dimensional gorenstein singularities of c3/ are iso-
lated if and only if  is abelian and every non-trivial element g   does not have 1
as an eigenvalue.

from this theorem, we can determine more precisely which three-dimensional
orbifolds of the form c3/,   su(3), have only isolated singularities. noting that
any abelian nite group  can be written as a product of cyclic groups, i.e.

 = zzk1  zzk2      zzkn ,

we summarize the results, which are proven in the appendix, as follows:

corollary 2.1 the gorenstein orbifold c3/ has only isolated singularities if
and only if  = zzk = h 1
k (1, 2, 3)i such that gcd(k, i) = 1, i. this in particular
implies that k has to be odd.

we would now like to study a possible connection of these gorenstein orbifolds

with isolated singularities to n = 2 landau-ginzburg theories.

2.2 c3/ as hypersurfaces and complete intersections

in order to make a direct connection to landau-ginzburg models, as previously dis-
cussed for two-dimensions, we need to determine whether the gorenstein orbifolds
can be represented by hypersurfaces in c4 so that their equations can play the role
of lg superpotentials. we will now show that an isolated 3-dimensional gorenstein
singularity actually cannot be embedded as a hypersurface in c4 but rather only as
a complete intersection ane variety in higher dimensions.

let us briey describe how to embed a gorenstein orbifold as an ane algebraic
variety in some cn. we will closely follow [23], restricting our attention to three-
dimensions. let s = c[z1, z2, z3] be a polynomial ring and s its subring of polyno-
mials which are invariant under the action of  : (z1, z2, z3) 7 (z1, z2, z3). one rst
9having non-isolated singularities can lead to problems such as an innite dimensional chiral

ring.

5

needs to nd the minimal set {f1, f2, . . . , fn} of generators of s as a c-algebra. let
c[y1, . . . , yn] be a polynomial ring associated to the generators, then there exists a
ring homomorphism

 : c[y1, . . . , yn]  s

(2.2)

dened by the substitution map

(f (y1, . . . , yn)) = f (f1, . . . , fn)

(2.3)
where f (y1, . . . , yn)  c[y1, . . . , yn]. then, we have im() = s = c[y1, . . . , yn]/k,
where k := ker() is an ideal with a minimal set of generators ri called relations.
now, the relations dene an ane algebraic subvariety v  cn:

v = {(y1, . . . , yn)  cn| ri(y1, . . . , yn) = 0, i} .

(2.4)

it has been shown in [2] that there exists a biholomorphism  : c3/  v, yielding
the desired embedding of gorenstein orbifolds as complete intersections in cn.

now, using the above prescription, we have explicitly checked for many of the
isolated gorenstein singularities given in corollary 2.1 that they cannot be embed-
ded simply as a hypersurface in c4. for example, we nd that c3/zz3 embeds in
c10. the computations are very laborious and discouraging.
in fact, it turns out
that isolated singularities of hypersurfaces in four or higher dimensions can never be
quotient singularities10 [24].

thus, we encounter a dicult problem that the isolated gorenstein singularities
cannot be simply represented as hypersurfaces in c4, and thus, there is no obvious
landau-ginzburg description of the singularities. at best, we can realize them as
complete intersections in higher dimensional embedding spaces cn, n > 4. it is still
possible to study complete intersections in the lg approach, but it usually requires
many extra variables and a non-trivial change of variables in the path integral. a
more serious problem arises from the fact that many of the subgroups of su(3) seem
to be missing in this analysis in the sense that they have non-isolated singularities

and therefore cannot be related to the dsu(3) wzw modular invariants in this way. in
particular, we have seen that zzk, for k even, does not give rise to isolated singularities
and hence cannot be related to a lg superpotential in a direct way.

3 modular invariants and kazama-suzuki models

it is well-known that the modular invariants of the dsu(2) wzw theories fall under an

a-d-e classication [1], which also governs the classication of the nite subgroups
10this may be related to schlessingers rigidity theorem which states that quotient singularities

of codimension three or greater does not have non-trivial deformations.

6

of su(2) [14]. the connection between the two a priori unrelated classications has
been explained in [17] by using11 sl(2)
u (1) kazama-suzuki models to describe12
a certain degenerating limit of the orbifolds c2/,   su(2). more precisely, the
sigma-model/kazama-suzuki correspondence states that the subgroup  is specied

u (1)  su (2)

by the same a-d-e dynkin diagram which classies the dsu(2) modular invariant
appearing in the partition function of the kazama-suzuki model. for example, the
an1 diagonal modular invariant arises in the kazama-suzuki model at level (n  2)
for the su (2)
u (1) sector, and the same dynkin diagram classies the zzn subgroup. it has
been argued in [17] that the tensored kazama-suzuki model at this level captures the
physics of the orbifold c2/zzn when the b-eld has been turned o. we will consider
here the simplest generalization13 of [17], namely sl(2)
su (2)u (1) , and see whether
there exists a corresponding geometry of some quotient singularities. in this section,
we briey review some useful facts about the kazama-suzuki models, and we will
devote the next section to nding the candidate geometry. as previously mentioned,
the hypersurface with an isolated singularity dened by the superpotential cannot
be a quotient singularity in three-dimensions. thus, if the kazama-suzuki model
is related to quotient singularities at all, then matching the equations of the ane
subvarieties representing gorenstein orbifolds with superpotentials, as done in [17]
for the ale spaces, does not work here, and we need to consider more indirect paths.

u (1)  su (3)

3.1 dsu (3) wzw and kazama-suzuki models

the simplest n = 2 coset models are based on hermitian symmetric spaces, more
specically complex grassman manifolds su(n + m)/su(n)  su(m)  u(1). al-
gebraically, these types of kazama-suzuki (ks) models are based on the gko coset
construction of

g(k, m, n) =

su(k + m)n  so(2km)1

su(k)m+n  su(m)k+n  u(1)km(k+m)(k+m+n)

(3.1)

where n is the level of su(k+m) and so on [12]. these models are manifestly symmet-
ric in k and m, and they actually turn out to be also symmetric in any permutation

11up to u (1) projections.
12roughly speaking, the sl(2)
u(1)

factor describes the feigin-fuchs boson emanating from the sin-

factor describes the transverse directions surrounding the singularity. fur-

gularity while the su(2)
u(1)
thermore, the su(2)
they arise from almost identical parafermionic representations. it is thus not very surprising that the
partition functions of the su(2)
invariants, up to dierent contributions from the u (1) theta functions.

u(1) kazama-suzuki model is closely related to the dsu (2) wzw theory, and indeed,
u(1) kazama-suzuki theory naturally contains the dsu (2) wzw modular

13generalizations to higher dimensions will appear in [19].

of k, m, and n, generalizing the level-rank duality of wzw models. the dsu(3)n
wzw theory is related14 to the g(2, 1, n) = su(3)n  so(4)1/su(2)n+1  u(1)6(n+3)
model [5], which is the one that we will consider in this paper and denote henceforth
by su(3)n/su(2)  u(1). before analyzing its landau-ginzburg formulation, we
will briey discuss the states and partition functions of the model in a more general
context.

let  be a highest weight of su(3) at level n, a that of so(4) at level 1, and 
of the coset theory is

that of su(2)  u(1) at level n + 1. then, a general eld ,a
dened by the decomposition



g v a = x



,a

 h  ,

(3.2)

where g, v and h are elds in the indicated representations of su(3), so(4) and
su(2)  u(1), respectively. the ane characters decompose in a similar way, and
the character of the coset theory is the branching function ,a

in



 a = x



,a
  .

(3.3)

the modular invariant partition function of the coset theory is then obtained by

taking products of left- and right-handed sectors

z =

k x

, , a, , 

c(, ), c( , )

,a
 n,  m, 

,a
 ,

(3.4)

where n and m are matrices dening the modular invariants of dsu(3)n and dsu(2)n+1
wzw, the summation is restricted to satisfy a certain condition c(, ), and k is
the order of the proper external automorphism group15 which identies elds in the
coset [6].

the situation simplies if we consider only the chiral16 scalars. then, the restric-
tion c(, ) just requires that  =  such that picking the su(3) integrable highest
weight, after the eld identications, uniquely xes the weights of su(2)  u(1) in
the decomposition (3.2). at level n, there are (n + 1)(n + 2)/2 such chiral scalars cor-

responding to the integrable highest weights, or primary elds, of the dsu(3) wzw,

and they are precisely the scalar components of the n = 2 lg superelds realizing

14in fact,

in many ways, g(k,1,n) kazama-suzuki models are n = 2 generalizations of the

dsu (k + 1)n wzw theories.

15the factor of 1/k is included to take care of the so-called eld identication problem. for the

su (m)n/su (m  1)n+1  u (1) theory, k = m(m  1).

16as usual, a eld is chiral if its n = 2 u (1) charge is twice its conformal dimension.

modular invariants of the dsu(3) wzw theory.
facts regarding the modular invariants and the verlinde algebras of the dsu(n) wzw
theories, we refer the reader to [4, 9]. as an illustration, figure 1 shows an dsu(3) a-
modular invariant at level 5. these diagrams will appear again in the toric resolution
of c3/zz8  zz8.

3.2 su (3)/su (2)  u (1) kazama-suzuki model

not all kazama-suzuki theories have landau-ginzburg realizations, but as mentioned
in the previous subsection, the particular model of our interest does have one [6, 13].
landau-ginzburg theories capture the chiral aspects of n = 2 scft, and in the
case of su(3)n/su(2)  u(1), it is the chiral part that is closely related to the
dsu(3)n wzw theory17. furthermore, lg theories are known to describe a dierent
phase of cy non-linear sigma-models [21]. thus, the n = 2 lg formulation of
the su(3)n/su(2)  u(1) ks model is the most natural setting for studying the
connection among nite subgroups, wzw theories, and geometry.

the superpotentials wn for the su(3)/su(2)u(1) kazama-suzuki coset models
17it has been shown in [5] that generalized chebyshev integrable deformations of the

su (n )n/su (n  1)  u (1) lg theories yield the correct verlinde algebra of the dsu (n )n wzw.

,

(3.5)

where it is understood that the superpotential is actually a function of the symmetric
polynomials x = q1 + q2 and y = q1q2. in terms of the x, y variables, the expressions
for a few low n are

w1 = x4  4x2y + 2y2

w2 = x5  5x3y + 5xy2

w3 = x6  6x4y + 9x2y2  2y3

w4 = x7  7x5y + 14x3y2  7xy3

w5 = x8  8x6y + 20x4y2  16x2y3 + 2y4

w6 = x9  9x7y + 27x5y2  30x3y3 + 9xy4

w7 = x10  10x8y + 35x6y2  50x4y3 + 25x2y4  2y5 ,

(3.6)

where we have rescaled by an over-all normalization. we see that wn is quasi-
homogeneous if we assign x and y of weights 1 and 2, respectively. the number
of chiral primary elds at level n is (n+2)(n+1)
which, as explained before, matches the
number of primary elds of the dsu(3)n wzw theory.
in the rest of the paper, we will be interested in a possible relation between
the above n = 2 lg theory and gorenstein singularities of the type c3/zzn+3 
zzn+3. to produce the correct total central charge c = 3, we need to tensor the
su(3)/su(2)  u(1) ks to an extra ks model. since we are interested in non-
compact orbifolds, with the hindsight from the two-dimensional black holes [22], we
consider the sl(2, ir)k/u(1) model whose central charge at level k is 1 + 2/(k  2).
since the central charge of su(3)/su(2)  u(1) at level n is 2n/(n + 3),

ctotal = c su (3)n

su (2)u (1)

+ c sl(2)k

u (1)

= 3 = k =

n + 9

3

.

(3.7)

the superpotential for the lg realization of the sl(2, ir)k/u(1) model is wk = t2k.
hence, the total superpotential for the tensor product theory sl(2,ir)(n+9)/3
is

 su (3)n

su (2)u (1)

u (1)

wt(t, x, y, z, w) = t n+3

3 + qn+3

1 + qn+3

2 + z2 + w2 ,

(3.8)

where again the expression should be understood as a function of x and y, and  is a
moduli parameter which we set equal to zero in the singular limit. note also that we
have added two more variables whose quadratic terms do not aect the chiral ring.
now, as in [17], we will go to the patch where t 6= 0 and think of wt(1, x, y, z, w) = 0 as
dening a hypersurface in c4, which we hope to relate to certain gorenstein orbifolds.

4 cp 2 kazama-suzuki and c3/zzn+3  zzn+3

in this section, we present some evidences that the landau-ginzburg formulation of
the su(3)n/su(2)  u(1) ks model may be related to a desingularization of the
c3/zzn+3  zzn+3 orbifolds. because of theorem 2.1, given a ks lg superpotential,
or a hypersurface with an isolated singularity for that matter, there is no canonical
way of relating it to a nite subgroup of su(3) and its associated gorenstein orbifold.
it is important to note at this point that the natural physical degrees of freedom
in a lg theory are the complex deformations of the superpotential by chiral ring
elements. the ks lg theories thus, if they are related to gorenstein orbifolds in some
way, describe a deformation, not resolution, of the singularities. deformation and
resolution of singular orbifolds in three-dimensions are two very dierent processes,
generally leading to topologically distinct manifolds. thus, a resolution of an orbifold
does not necessarily carry information about the structure of a deformed manifold; but
amazingly, it sometimes does. an example is the phenomenon occurring in [20] in the
context of discrete torsion. in that case, t 2t 2t 2/zz2zz2 can be either completely
resolved without discrete torsion or deformed in terms of the invariant variables in the
presence of discrete torsion, resulting in 64 remaining conifold singularities. the two
desingularizations are argued to be mirror pairs. motivated by this interesting case
and the ease with which resolutions can be studied, we propose a simple but naive
step towards nding possible subgroups of su(3) that can be related to the ks lg
theories: we search for resolutions of c3/,   su(3), whose classical cohomology
encodes the chiral ring structure of the su(3)n/su(2)  u(1) kazama-suzuki model.
an ad hoc proposal such as ours is worth considering if and perhaps only if it meets
a success; but surprisingly, it has. in this section, we will see that the resolution of
c3/zzn+3  zzn+3 seems to be closely related to our coset theory.

it turns out that considering the subgroups of the form zzn  zzn cures some
of the diculties previously encountered, while, at the same time, introducing new
obstacles. the group

zzn+3  zzn+3 = h

(4.1)

where exp(2i/(n + 3)) is a primitive (n + 3)-th root of unity, is actually a maximal
nite subgroup of su(3) consisting of all cyclic elements of order (n + 3). thus,
we seem to have incorporated many of the missing subgroups of su(3) in this
approach. on the other hand, the orbifold c3/zzn+3  zzn+3 has singularities along
subvarieties, and thus, their dening hypersurface equations cannot be used as lg

11

superpotentials at rst sight18. we nevertheless argue that the resolved geometry of
that type appears to classify the dsu(3) as well as dsu(2) wzw modular invariants.
we rst study the geometry of the resolution of c3/zzn+3  zzn+3 orbifold singu-
larities both from the toric geometry and algebraic geometry points of view. we then
comment on the desingularization by complex structure deformations and speculate
that the lg theories describe the geometry of certain deformations of c3/zzn+3 
zzn+3.

4.1 cohomology of the resolution and mckay correspon-

dence

there are several ways to study the resolution of three-dimensional gorenstein sin-
gularities and compute the hodge numbers of the resolution.
it is known that all
crepant resolutions are related to each other by ops. let  : m  c3/zzn+3  zzn+3
be a resolution of c3/zzn+3  zzn+3. then, using the age grading of the zzn+3  zzn+3
subgroup introduced in [10] in the context of mckay correspondence19, we nd:

#{elements of age 0} = h0(m, q) = 1

#{elements of age 1} = h2(m, q) =

#{elements of age 2} = h4(m, q) =

(n + 7)(n + 2)

2

(n + 1)(n + 2)

2

,

(4.2)

where hi are the hodge numbers of the resolved manifold. these numbers can also
be obtained from toric geometry, as will be discussed in the next subsection.

the sum of the hodge numbers, which is just the euler characteristics of m in
this case, is equal to (n + 3)2 which is precisely the order of the group zzn+3  zzn+3.
the number (n+3)2 is also the number of irreducible representations of zzn+3 zzn+3,
and thus, we see that the predictions of the mckay correspondenceor string theory,
whichever the reader prefersare well satised.

4.2 toric resolution of c3/zzn+3  zzn+3

the hodge numbers (4.2) can also be computed directly from geometry by using
toric blow-ups and poincare duality. for background materials on toric varieties, see
[16]. the cone for the unresolved c3/zzn+3  zzn+3 is dened over a convex polygon
18such superpotentials lead to degenerate conformal eld theories, and the chiral ring is innite

dimensional.

to resolve the singularities, we need to add in all lattice points lying on the

units. as an example, figure 3 gives the polygon for a particular complete resolution
of c3/zz8  zz8, other crepant resolutions being related to this one by a sequence of
ops.

figure 3: the polygon for completely resolved c3/zz8  zz8. the toric fan consists of
cones dened over this polygon.

here, the new points on the outer boundary of the polygon represent non-compact
exceptional divisors which are ruled surfaces lying along the three coordinate axes of
c3/zz8  zz8. in the general case of c3/zzn+3  zzn+3, we will have 3(n + 2) ruled
surfaces as non-compact exceptional divisors. we can understand their origin as
follows: the group zzn+3  zzn+3 has two generators  = 1
n+3(, , 0) and  =
1
n+3(0, , ). then, there are three zzn+3  su(2) subgroups of zzn+3  zzn+3,

13

namely hi, hi, and hi, which x z1, z2, and z3 coordinates of c3, respectively, and
produce the familiar an+2 ale singularities along those axes. the an+2 singularities
in ale spaces are resolved by a chain of (n + 2) ip1 blow-ups which, upon bration
over the coordinate axes, become the 3(n + 2) ruled surfaces that we see in the toric

resolution. now, since an+2 ale singularities classify the diagonal dsu(2)n+1 wzw
modular invariants, what we have just found is that the ruled surfaces in the resolution
of c3/zzn+3  zzn+3 classify the same invariants.

the remaining (n+ 1)(n+ 2) non-trivial elements of zzn+3 zzn+3 not contained in
those three zzn+3  su(2) subgroups are all seen not to possess an eigenvalue 1, and
thus, they lead to an isolated quotient singularity at the origin which is resolved by
introducing (n + 1)(n + 2)/2 degree 6 del pezzo surfaces. these compact exceptional
divisors are the 21 interior points in figure 3, which is the correct number of del pezzo
surfaces for n = 5. immediate from the toric digram is another observation that the

dsu(3)n modular invariants are classied by the (n + 1)(n + 2)/2 compact del pezzo
exceptional divisors. the fourth hodge number h4 can be computed by applying the
poincare duality to the compact20 second cohomology h 2
c (m, q), which is dual to
the del pezzo surfaces, and thus we have (n + 1)(n + 2)/2 two-cycles which appear
in the intersections of the exceptional divisors. we now see that of (n + 1)(n + 2)
non-trivial elements of zzn+3  zzn+3 not contained in the zzn+3  su(2) subgroups,
half of them corresponds to the del pezzo surfaces and the other half to the non-
trivial two-cycles. furthermore, the aforementioned mckay correspondence is clearly
satised, and there is indeed a one-to-one correspondence between the irreducible
representations of zzn+3 zzn+3 and the cohomology elements of the resolved manifold
[10].

4.3

intersection homologies and blow-ups

we now study the classical intersection theory on the resolved manifold and see that
it reproduces a perturbed chiral ring structure of the coset theory. we do not know
whether the full quantum intersection theory would correspond to the unperturbed
chiral ring, which happens to be the cohomology ring of the grassmannian u(n +
2)/u(2)  u(n) satisfying the schubert calculus.

in this section, we argue that the classical intersection homology of the resolved

c3/zzn+3 zzn+3 captures the diagonal verlinde algebras of the dsu(3)n and dsu(2)n+1

wzw theories. there are two ways of illustrating this. the rst way is to use the
stanley-reisner relations in toric geometry to nd the cohomology ring structure. in

20because we are dealing with non-compact spaces, we need to take some caution when applying

mathematical facts that are familiar from studying compact spaces.

14

fact, without going into details, a rough picture of the intersection homology comes
from the following facts:

1. two divisors, which are represented by points on the polygon, intersect along

a two-cycle if and only if their points are connected by a line in the polygon.

2. three divisors intersect at a point if and only if their corresponding points form

three vertices of a triangle in the triangulation of the polygon.

hence, just by looking at the toric resolution diagrams, the simple-minded rule that
two primary elds fuse if and only if their corresponding exceptional divisors intersect

and the intersection homology of the resolved manifold. that is, the intersections

gives a relation21 between the fusion matrices of the dsu(3) and dsu(2) wzw theories
of the ruled surfaces give the verlinde algebra of the dsu(2)n+1 wzw while the
intersections of the del pezzo surfaces yield that of the dsu(3)n wzw.
the second way to see the details of the resolved geometry of c3/zzn+3  zzn+3
is to blow up explicitly along subvarieties which are loci of the singularities. we
will just sketch the main ideas by blowing up along one of the coordinate axes.
as will be subsequently discussed, the equation xyz = wn+3 describes the orbifold
c3/zzn+3  zzn+3 as an ane subvariety m  c4. it has three lines of singularities
along xy = 0, xz = 0, and yz = 0. without a loss of generality, let us take the rst
locus xy = 0 and blow up along the z-axis. dene

 = {(x, y, z, w)  (s, t, u)  c4  ip2 | xt = ys, xu = ws, yu = wt} .

(4.3)

we have eectively replaced c4 by c1  oip2(1), or equivalently, we have replaced
the origin of c4 with an exceptional divisor e = ip2 so that  :  \ e  c4 \ {0}
is an isomorphism. away from x = y = w = 0, m is just its 1-1 pre-image. to
understand the blow-up geometry at x = y = w = 0 and z 6= 0, we consider a line
passing through a point (x, y, z, w) on the hypersurface and (0, 0, z, 0) at constant
z. by construction (4.3), each such a line denes a point on the ip2. now, we take
the limit where the point on the hypersurface approaches (0, 0, z, 0) in all possible
directions and determine the corresponding limiting points on the ip2. intuitively,
each tangent line at the singular point (0, 0, z, 0) along the constant z subvariety
becomes a point on the exceptional divisor ip2, and thus in the blow-up picture
the hypersurface will end on a one-dimensional subvariety on ip2 as follows: pick a

21this rule is a generalization of that in two-dimensions where the intersection matrices of ex-

ceptional ip1 divisors reproduce the fusion matrices of dsu (2) wzw. but, here the analogy is not
completely satisfactory, because the divisors intersect along any one of the (n+1)(n+2)/2 two-cycles
in the resolution of c3/zzn+3  zzn+3.

15

point [s, t, u]  ip2 with a xed length |s|2 + |t|2 + |u|2 = 1, and consider the point
(s, t, z, u)  c4, where || << 1. now, demanding that the point (s, t, z, u) lies
on the hypersurface xyz = wn+3, we have

stz2 = n+3un+3  0 = s = 0 or t = 0.

(4.4)

hence, we see that the hypersurface ends on two intersecting ip1s in ip2 dened by
the homogeneous coordinates s = 0 and t = 0. since the singularities actually occur
along the z-axis, each ip1 is brated over the axis and thus denes a ruled surface.

we also want to know how the hypersurface has transformed near the exceptional
ip2, and for that purpose, we need to view  as c1  oip2(1), where oip2(1) is
the universal bundle of ip2. on the patch where u 6= 0, the good coordinates of the
ip2 are

 =

and  =

s
u

t
u

.

(4.5)

(4.6)

in these variables, we have x = w and y = w, and the hypersurface becomes

xyz = wn+3 = w2(z  wn+1) = 0 .

in the new coordinates, w = 0 corresponds to x = y = w = 0 and thus to the entire
ip2. so, the intersection of the hypersurface with ip2 is given by

z  wn+1 = 0,

(4.7)

which is just the original equation with its degree diminished by 2, and the resulting
singularity structures (4.7) are the same as before. that is, it again has singularities
along the z-axis at  = w = 0, which is precisely at s = t = 0 where two ip1s
meet on ip2. this kind of singularities is exactly the same as that appearing in the
resolution of an+2 ale spaces, except here we introduce a pair of ruled surfaces rather
than ip1s with each blow up. repeating this procedure until we have resolved all the
singularities along the z-axis will thus produce (n + 2) ruled surfaces intersecting in a
chain, which clearly corresponds to the points on the outer edge of the toric picture.
we have now understood the 3 chains of (n + 2) ruled surfaces whose intersections

clearly resemble the verlinde algebra of the dsu(2)n+1 wzw theory. in retrospect,
we should have expected this phenomenon because, as previously discussed, these
non-isolated singularities result from the zzn+3  su(2)  su(3) and we know from
[17] that an+2 ale spaces classify the dsu(2)n+1 diagonal modular invariants.

analysis of the extra singularity at the origin can be performed in a similar way,
in principle, but the computation is highly non-trivial and we omit its presentation
in this paper. for that purpose, it is much easier to resort to the toric resolutions.

figure 4: the fan for the resolved c3/zz8  zz8 encodes the dsu(3)5 and dsu(2)6

modular invariants.

we have previously seen that the extra quotient singularities at the origin arise from
those elements of zzn+3  zzn+3 which are not contained in a su(2) subgroup of
su(3). half of those non-trivial elements corresponds to the (n + 1)(n + 2)/2 del
pezzo surfaces, and the other half should correspond to (n + 1)(n + 2)/2 two-cycles,
which we have not been able to analyze in any detail22. thus, if we were to relate
the nite subgroups zzn+3  zzn+3 to the diagonal dsu(3)n wzw modular invariants,
of those del pezzo surfaces seem to reproduce the verlinde algebra of dsu(3)n wzw

we need to look at the del pezzo divisors over the origin. indeed, the intersections

at level n and classify the corresponding diagonal modular invariant. a more precise
formulation of the correspondence would have to realize the fusion coecients as some
functions23 of the intersection homology, which would require an understanding of the
two-cycles.

we now need to know how the dsu(2)n+1 and dsu(3)n wzw theories are related to
the su(3)n/su(2)u(1) kazama-suzuki model. besides the fact that these theories
arise in the gko coset construction of the ks theory, recall the following facts about
the wzw models and the lg formulation of the ks theory [5]: the su(3)n/su(2)
u(1) kazama-suzuki model has (n + 1)(n + 2)/2 chiral primary elds and under the
perturbation of the lg superpotential by generalized chebyshev polynomials, the

chiral ring structure reproduces the dsu(3)n wzw fusion coecients. hence, the

chiral primaries of the ks theory are in one-to-one correspondence with the primary

22to do so, one really needs to study the stanley-reisner ideals to nd the cohomology generators.
23our speculation that the primaries fuse if and only if the del pezzo surfaces intersect along some

two cycle seems too naive at the moment.

the verlinde algebra. this correspondence between the deformed chiral ring and the

furthermore, the landau-ginzburg formulation of the kazama-suzuki theory at level

elds of the dsu(3)n wzw theory, and the chiral algebra is the homogeneous part of
wzw verlinde algebra actually generalizes to all cp n ks and dsu(n + 1) wzw.
n is obtained from the diagonal modular invariants of the dsu(3)n wzw at level n,
which is classied by diagrams such as figure 1, and those of the dsu(2)n+1 wzw at
level (n+1), which is classied by the an+2 dynkin diagram. incidentally, we have just
seen that the toric resolution diagram for c3/zzn+3  zzn+3 contains both the dsu(3)n
the dsu(2)n+1 wzw modular invariant graphs on the outer edges. for n = 5, we
is a complete uke or is actually in line with the attempt to classify the dsu(3)n wzw

wzw modular invariant graph as a subgraph describing the del pezzo surfaces and

display the observation in figure 4. whether this strange, but general, phenomenon

modular invariants using nite subgroups remains to be seen. in order to prove that
there actually exist underlying relations among the wzw modular invariants, the
subgroups zzn+3  zzn+3 and the orbifolds c3/zzn+3  zzn+3, we would need a scft
description of the gorenstein orbifolds. turning things around, we speculate that,
given the close connections between the ks and wzw models, the above observations
seem to suggest that the scft is likely to contain the su(3)n/su(2)u(1) kazama-
suzuki model as one of its factors. the lg scft however does not describe the
resolution of c3/zzn+3  zzn+3, but rather some deformation or a combination of
both.

we devote the remainder of the paper to examining the above observations and

their consequences.

4.4 hypersurfaces and lg theories

our ultimate interest in studying any kind of correspondences among seemingly un-
related objects lies in understanding the a priori reason for such occurrences. the
status of the su(2) cases is much more well-founded than the fairly untouched su(3)
counterparts. thus, without any pretense of rigor or fallacious condence, we want
to devote the rest of this paper in making several comments which may shed some
light for future eorts.

for our study, the work of joyce plays an important role [11]. given a gorenstein
orbifold c3/, we can often nd a family of desingularizations  : m  c3/ carry-
ing geometric structures that are compatible with calabi-yau conditions and which
approach the orbifold geometry at a degenerating limit. using deformations of codi-
mension two singularities, joyce has shown that there are in fact many topologically

18

distinct families of calabi-yau desingularizations, with dierent24 hodge numbers
and euler characteristics. indeed, mathematically, desingularizing orbifold singulari-
ties is an extremely complicated and laborious process. even for the simplest case of
c3/zz2  zz2, joyce has found nine distinct calabi-yau desingularizations. similarly,
in the case of t 6/zz2  zz2, there are thousands of dierent calabi-yau desingular-
izations, two of which are selected out by string theory with and without a discrete
torsion [20]. why do other desingularizations not have physical realizations? is it
possible that there are physical desingularizations of which we are presently unaware?
so far, we have seen that the resolution of the c3/zzn+3zzn+3 gorenstein orbifold
seems to reproduce the verlinde algebras and the modular invariants of the dsu(3)n
and dsu(2)n+1 wzw theories, which arise in the construction of the su(3)n/su(2) 
u(1) ks model. we interpret this phenomenon as implying that the ks lg theory
could be describing some kind of a deformation of c3/zzn+3 zzn+3 in such a way that
upon blowing down the the exceptional divisors in the resolution and then deforming
the singularities, the information about the intersection homology on the resolved
manifold gets transmitted to the chiral ring of the ks theory. it is not clear to us how
to interpret the chiral ring geometrically in terms of the deformed manifold, although
as will be subsequently discussed, studying the intersections of vanishing cycles on the
milnor lattice of the ks lg ane variety gives a suggestion. interestingly, we have
found a coordinate transformation which transforms the ks superpotential into the
hypersurface equation for c3/zzn+3  zzn+3, but the transformation is not everywhere
well-dened.

the rst step in trying to desingularize the gorenstein singularity by deformation
is to embed the orbifold in c4 as a hypersurface, and then, deform the algebraic
equation while maintaining the calabi-yau properties. using the procedure of [23],
we can represent the orbifold c3/zzn+3 zzn+3 as a hypersurface in c4 as follows: the
independent, invariant monomials that can be constructed out of (z1, z2, z3)  c3 are

x = zn+3

1

y = zn+3

2

z = zn+3

3

w = z1z2z3 ,

(4.8)

and it can be checked that they generate the invariant subring szzn+3zzn+3 of the

24it is believed that all crepant resolutions in any dimension give rise to the string theory orbifold

euler characteristics and hodge numbers, when things are properly dened.

19

polynomial ring c[z1, z2, z3]. the relation among the invariants is

xyz = wn+3 ,

(4.9)

which embeds c3/zzn+3  zzn+3 in c4.

now, note the curious fact that there is a singular coordinate transformation that
maps the kazama-suzuki superpotential to an expression similar to the form (4.9):
consider the redenitions

x =   1

n+3 (1 + ) , y =   2

n+3

(4.10)

in the superpotentials (3.6) or (3.5). then, the superpotentials can be written as

wn =

1

 (cid:16)1 + n+3 + zw(cid:17) ,

(4.11)

where the term inside the parenthesis is a deformation of the expression (4.9). it seems
to suggest that the su(3)n/su(2)  u(1) kazama-suzuki model is indeed describing
a complex deformation of the gorenstein orbifold c3/zzn+3  zzn+3, but we do not
understand the validity of this argument since the coordinate transformation has a
non-constant jacobian

(x, y)
(, )

=

1

n+3

  3
n + 3

(1  )

(4.12)

which is not everywhere well-dened.

the motivation for the coordinate transformation (4.10) comes from the fact that
the su(3)n/su(2)u(1) kazama-suzuki model possesses a discrete zzn+3 symmetry
and thus, as it is familiar from standard gepner constructions, that we really need to
consider a zzn+3 orbifold of the ks lg theory. it is easy to see that the coordinates
 and  are zzn+3 invariant coordinates.

besides the deformed chiral ring structure of the ks theories, there are other

evidences that the ks model is an n = 2 analogue of the dsu(3)n wzw theory. for
example, regarding the su(3)n/su(2)  u(1) ks lg superpotential as dening an
ane variety actually leads to very interesting results. in [8], it has been shown that
the intersection form of vanishing cycles in the milnor lattice of the ane variety

dened by the superpotential reproduces the dsu(3)n verlinde algebra. thus, we

see that the classical intersection theory of the del pezzo surfaces in the resolved
gorenstein orbifold is encoded in the intersection forms of vanishing cycles in the
ane variety of the ks lg superpotential.

20

5 conclusion: much ado about nothing?

the idea of classifying the dsu(3) wzw modular invariants in terms of nite sub-

groups of su(3) has not met much success to date. in this paper, we have reduced
the problem into geometry and n = 2 superconformal eld theorythat is, into nd-
ing pairs of gorenstein singularities and associated lg superconformal eld theories
which have a priori connections to the nite subgroups and the modular invari-
ants. unlike the situation for su(2), such an attempt to nd scft descriptions of
gorenstein singularities is hindered by the complexity of singularity structures and
their desingularizations. furthermore, we have seen that there is no direct correspon-
dence between lg superpotentials and isolated quotient singularities; even though lg
superpotentials have isolated singularities, isolated quotient singularities cannot be
represented as hypersurfaces and thus cannot be lg superpotentials. we have been
thus led to more indirect methods of analyzing the possible connections between
lg theories and gorenstein orbifolds. we have chosen the su(3)n/su(2)  u(1)
ks model as our particular lg theory and searched for evidences for a correspon-
dence with a gorenstein orbifold c3/ by studying the intersection homology of its
resolution. among many subgroups   su(3) that we have considered, we have
found some surprising matches between the resolution of c3/zzn+3  zzn+3 and the
su(3)n/su(2)  u(1) ks lg theory at level n.

using dierent techniques of desingularization generally leads to topologically in-
equivalent calabi-yau manifolds with dierent hodge numbers. furthermore, we
know that the ks lg theories describe deformations and not resolutions of goren-
stein orbifolds. at rst sight, one might expect some kind of mirror symmetry between
the resolved c3/zzn+3  zzn+3 and the lg orbifold. the complete resolution of the
singularity produces a rigid calabi-yau with no complex deformations. on the other
hand, one can embed the orbifold in c4 by the equation xyz = wn+3 and try to deform
the algebraic equation to remove the singularities, in which case the hodge numbers
are completely dierent from the resolution picture. in fact, with judicious choices
of deformations, it is possible to produce a cy manifold with no second cohomology.
after all, certain rigid manifolds are known to have as their mirrors landau-ginzburg
theories, whose physical modes have a natural interpretation as complex deformations
of the superpotential but which have no explicit, geometric kahler modes. thus, it
may appear to be not all inconceivable that there exist landau-ginzburg mirrors of
the complete or partial resolutions of the gorenstein orbifolds. a careful investiga-
tion, however, shows that there are problems with this picture.
in particular, the
kahler classes of the resolved manifolds correspond to cft moduli elds, but the

21

chiral ring in general consists of relevant, marginal, and irrelevant operators25. they
are thus not mirror pairs.

what is more likely to be true is that the ks theory actually describes some defor-
mation of c3/zzn+3  zzn+3 which is quite dierent from the picture that traditional
string theory techniques yield. thus, besides the two known string theory calabi-yau
desingularizations, with and without discrete torsion, among thousands of other ones
allowed by mathematics, perhaps certain ks theories can provide us with exactly
solvable descriptions of new desingularizations of gorenstein orbifolds.

we have dismissed many issues in this paper, mainly because not many things are
known about the interpretation of ks lg theories as describing non-compact calabi-
yau manifolds. it would be interesting to see whether the full quantum cohomology
of the resolved gorenstein orbifold can be related to the chiral ring of some ks lg
model, but this subject is clearly beyond the scope of this paper. the reader may
have noticed that, in our presentation, we have largely ignored the non-compact factor
sl(2, ir)/u(1) and the u(1) projection onto integral charges. it is because the main
focus of the paper lies in classifying the wzw modular invariants using geometry
and because the relevant information is contained in the su(3)n/su(2)  u(1) sector
of the tensored theory26. despite our eort, there is yet no explanation of why we
should a priori expect the nite subgroups to classify certain modular invariants of
conformal systems beyond the su(2) case.

among the questions that we have ignored are: what would the integrable de-
formations of the ks theory correspond to in terms of geometry? can we include
d-branes in our study? what ks elds correspond to the non-compact ruled surfaces
in the resolution; are they related to the sl(2, ir)/u(1) sector?

finally, note that the gorenstein orbifolds of the form c3/zzn  zzn have also
appeared in the context of ads/cft correspondence [15]. the non-spherical near
horizon geometry of a d3-brane located at the origin of c3/zzn  zzn, for n = 2, 3,
has been shown to be given by u(1) bundles over certain del pezzo surfaces.
it
is also known that the su(2)/u(1) kazama-suzuki model is closely related to the
near horizon geometry of ns5-branes. it would be worth studying whether a similar
picture exists for other grassman kazama-suzuki models. furthermore, regarding
the modern string compactications on ads backgrounds, we are reminded of the

25in lg theories, there exists a unique state whose u (1) charge is equal to c. since c = 2n/(n + 3)
for the su (3)n/su (2)  u (1) ks model, there will always be irrelevant chiral ring elements for
n > 3.

26furthermore, imitating the ideas of [17], we want to send the coecient  in (3.8) to zero and
argue that the tensored theory describes the degenerating limit of an ane variety dened by the
superpotential.

situation in 1980s where the validity of calabi-yau compactications was justied
to some extent by replacing geometric compactications with algebraic counterparts
using exactly solvable n = 2 minimal models [5]. similarly, it would be very interest-
ing to see whether there exist exactly solvable superconformal systems27 describing
the ads compactications. we hope that our present study may well be pertinent to
such directions of pursuit.

a appendix

in this appendix, we determine which abelian quotient singularities are isolated. from
theorem 2.1, we can prove the following simple results:

corollary a.2 the orbifold c3/zzk, zzk  su(3), has only an isolated sin-
gularity if and only if zzk = h 1
k (1, 2, 3)i has gcd(k, i) = 1, i. in particular,
c3/zzk always has non-isolated singularities for k even.

proof: let zzk = hi, where  = 1
k (1, 2, 3). it is easy to see that any non-trivial
element n  zzk does not have an eigenvalue 1 if and only if gcd(k, i) = 1, i,
and the rst claim thus follows from theorem 2.1. now, since zzk  su(3), the is
satisfy the condition 1 + 2 + 3 = 0 (mod k), which implies that for k even, at
least one i, say 1, also has to be even. let m = gcd(1, k)  2. then, the action
of the non-trivial element k/m on c3 xes the rst coordinate and thus produces a
non-isolated singularity along this axis.



furthermore, a product of two cyclic groups satisfying the above conditions yields

an isolated singularity if and only if their orders are coprime:

corollary a.3 let zzk = h 1
su(3), where 0 < i < k and 0 < 
gcd(k, i) = gcd(k, 
ties if and only if k and k are coprime.

k (1, 2, 3)i  su(3) and zzk = h 1

3)i 
i < k. assume that k, k are odd and that
i) = 1, i. then, c3/zzk  zzk has only isolated singulari-

k (

1, 

2, 

proof: without a loss of generality, assume that k < k. in the diagonal basis, we
can represent any non-trivial elements g  zzk and g   zzk as g = 1
k (a1, a2, a3) and
g  = 1
k (b1, b2, b3), for some integers 0 < ai < k and 0 < bi < k. we see that gg  has
an eigenvalue 1 if and only if

(a.1)

(a.2)

ai
k

or equivalently,

ai =

k(k  bi)

k

+

bi
k = 1

for some i. now, assume that gcd(k, k) = 1. then, (a.2) tells us that in order for
ai to be an integer, k has to divide k  bi, which is impossible.

conversely, suppose that gcd(k, k) = c > 1, such that k = cm and k =
cn for some positive coprime integers m, n. but, because we have assumed that
k (a1, a2, a3) and
gcd(k, i) = gcd(k, 

i) = 1 i, there will be elements g = 1

24

k (b1, b2, b3) for any d, 1  d < c, such that a1 = dm and b1 = n(c  d).

g  = 1
then, we have

a1
k

+

b1
k =

a1n + b1m

cmn

= 1

and thus, gg  has an eigenvalue 1.



corollary a.3 just means that zzk  zzk = zzkk, where zzkk must satisfy the

conditions of corollary a.2. corollary 2.1 now follows.
