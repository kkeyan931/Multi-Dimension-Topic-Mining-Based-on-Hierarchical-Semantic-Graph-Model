on the flattening of negative curvature via t-duality with

a non-constant b

abstract

in an earlier paper, alvarez, alvarez-gaume, barbon and lozano pointed out,
that the only way to atten negative curvature by means of a t-duality is by
introducing an appropriate, non-constant ns-ns b eld. in this letter, we are
investigating this further and ask, whether it is possible to t-dualize adsd space
to at space with some suitably chosen b. to answer this question, we derive
a relationship between the original curvature tensor and the one of the t-dualized
metric involving the b eld. it turns out that there is one particular component,
which is independent of b . by inspection of this component, we can then show,
that it is not possible to dualize adsd to at space irrespective of b . finally, we
examine the extension of ads to an ads5  s5 geometry and propose a chain of s-
and t-dualities together with an sl(2, z) coordinate transformation, leading to a
dual d9-brane geometry.

by now the ads-cft conjecture [1, 2, 3] has passed an enormous amount of tests (see
[4] for a review). most of them explored the large n duality between the boundary-cft
and the supergravity on ads5. the common radius of the s5 and the length-scale of the
ads5, r, is given by r4 = ()2, with  = g2
y m n representing the t hooft coupling. in
general supergravity as the low-energy limit of string-theory is trustworthy only at large
scales, i.e. small curvatures. thus tests of the duality probing the supergravity regime
explore the    parameter region. this predicts how the cft at large n behaves in
the extreme non-perturbative regime.
the interesting parameter regime, interpolating between the perturbative   0 and
the extreme non-perturbative    regime, demands that we keep  nite. since the
closed string coupling constant gs and the yang-mills coupling constant are related via
g2
y m = 4gs, the large n limit with  nite, requires gs  0. thus via the ads-cft
conjecture, we are able to extract the full quantum information about the cft in the large
n limit by calculating simply iib string tree-diagrams. unfortunately, this wonderful
perspective is obstructed by the fact, that iib string-theory in the rns-formulation on
an ads5  s5 background with n units of rr 5-form ux through the s5 is still obscure
(see [5] for an approach). on the other hand there are proposals for a gs-formulation [6]
which is non-linear and therefore its quantization and computation of string scattering
amplitudes seems to be dicult.

since string-theory on an ads5  s5 background is not readily available, one may
seek resort to a dual description of iib string-theory on a, hopefully, easier background.
as a rst step into this direction, we want to analyze in this paper, whether pure adsd
space can be dualized to at minkowski space. the motivation for this problem stems
from the observation, made in [7], that the only way to atten negative curvature under
t-duality is by introducing an appropriate torsion, generated by b, in the initial space-
time. this can be seen from the following formula2, relating the dual curvature scalar r
to the initial one [7]

r = r + 4 ln k +

1
k2 hh  

k2

ff  ,

(1)

with a = k/k2, where k = g, and the associated eld-strength f = a  a.
as usual, the torsion 3-form is the eld strength3 h = db of the ns-ns 2-form b.
the killing vector, corresponding to the assumed translational isometry exhibited by the

initial space-time, is given by k and its norm dened by k = pgkk. one could now
try to solve (1) for r =  and r = 0, with  a positive constant. but this would
include any solution of the vacuum einstein equations. to decide whether we arrive at
at space after t-dualization, we have to regard the riemann curvature tensor.

2the index  represents the isometry direction, whereas , , . . . label the remaining directions.
3our conventions are:

b =

b dx  dx ,

h =

so let us start quite generally by assuming some coordinate representation of a d-
dimensional manifold, given by x = (x0, x1, . . . , xd2, xd1) = (x, x) ;  = 0, . . . , d  2.
furthermore, the initial metric is supposed to be of the form

ds2 = gdxdx + gdxdx .

(2)

from the buscher rules for t-duality

g =

g =

g

g = g 

(gg  bb)

g

,

we observe, that our choice of g = 0 cannot be compensated by an appropriate choice of
some real-valued b (only an imaginary would suce). the reason why we set neverthe-
less g = 0, from the outset, is the following. according to (1), a non-vanishing g = k
tends to make the curvature scalar of the dual metric more negative. since we start with
a negatively curved adsd and aim to bring it to at space, a k 6= 0 would obstruct our
intention.
we assume that the metric g(x) and the ns-ns 2-form b(x) do not depend on
x. these conditions are exactly those, which are required in order to leave the -model
action

s =

1

2 z d2z (g + b) x  x 

invariant under innitesimal shifts x  x + k. the killing vector associated with the
resulting abelian translational isometry, is k = /x, with k = (k, k) = (0, . . . , 1).
with the resulting norm k = g of the killing vector, a more convenient expression for
the metric (2) in view of our later application, is given in terms of a tangent frame by

ds2 = abeaeb + eiei = mnemen ,

where the chosen non-coordinate frame el = (ea, ei) reads

ea = ea

(x)dx ,

ei = ei

dx = i

k(x)dx ,

such that the vielbeins el

 are

later, we will also need the inverted vielbein of the isometry direction e 

i = 

i/k.

,g + k

the above mentioned -model action is invariant [8] to rst order in  under the
translational isometry x = k, if k satises the killing equation (lkg) = kg, +
k
,g = g/x = 0 and the torsion obeys lkh = 0. this implies lkb = dw
for some 1-form w. here lk and d denote the space-time lie- and exterior derivative.
locally, this is solved by w = ikb  v with dv = ikh for some 1-form v. under ik we

2

understand the interior product. from now on, we will choose the gauge w = 0, which
leads us with the identity (ikb) = kb = b to

the t-dual metric g reduces in the case of k = 0 to

v = b .

thus the dual line-element can be written as

ds2 = gdxdx + 2gdxdx + gdxdx = abeaeb + eiei = mnemen .

a useful formula consists of the inverted relation i

dx = kei  e

the strategy of the calculation of the dual riemann-tensor will now be as follows.
with the aid of cartans structure equations, we determine the curvature tensor and its
t-dual in the el = {ea, ei}, resp. t-dual el = {ea, ei} frame. in order to compare both
of them, it is further necessary to switch to the equivalent expressions in the common
coordinate base x = (x, x) with the help of the afore mentioned vielbeins.

therefore, let us begin with (3) and avail ourselves of cartans rst structure equation

as an application of these general formulas, we now want to verify, if d-dimensional

4

adsd space can be t-dualized to at space under the inclusion of some suitably chosen
b. for this, we choose the following coordinate representation for adsd

ds2 = r2(cid:18)  dt2 +

d2

xj=1

dyjdyj(cid:19) +

dr2
r2 ,

(12)

where for simplicity, we have normalized the curvature-radius to 1. for the isometry
direction we choose one of the yj coordinates, e.g. yd2. in our above convention, the
adapted coordinates are x0 = t, x1 = y1, . . . , xd3 = yd3, xd2 = r, xd1  x = yd2.
the curvature tensor of the negatively curved, maximally symmetric adsd is given by
r =  (gg  gg), which reduces in our parameterization to

r = r4 ,

r =  ,



and all other components vanishing. the important observation is, that there is one
particular equation, (11), for the dual curvature-tensor, which is independent of v, resp.
b and hence allows answering our problem. plugging in the actual norm of the killing
vector, k = r, for the above adsd metric, we obtain for the right-hand side of (11), the

)2 a

a

 d2

 (x) = (a

(cid:1) /r4. obviously, this does not fulll the requirement r = 0
value (cid:0)  2d2
for at space. the tensor transformation property r
  r(x),
 = x/x, then guarantees that this term is also non-vanishing for any other
with a
coordinate parameterization of adsd. thus at space cannot be reached from pure adsd
via t-duality plus the inclusion of some carefully chosen b. the general formulae (9)-
(11) can serve as a starting point for more involved t-dualities, including a non-trivial
b, of adsd or the more important ads5  s5 extension to other spaces [9].
eventually, we turn briey to the important ads5  s5 extension of ads. here it
seems possible to relate the iib d9-brane geometry, which describes d=10 space itself,
to the ads5  s5 geometry. in order to do so, one has to start with a six-fold t-duality,
transforming the d9-brane to the d3-brane. then, dualizing a iib d3-brane to its own
near-horizon geometry, one reaches ads5  s5. this can be done following the work of
[10]. starting with the d3-brane geometry

ds2 =

performing a t-duality over x3, x2 brings us to the iib d1-brane. a further s-duality
transformation yields the fundamental string solution, which is then t-dualized over x1

5

to obtain the gravitational wave solution

ds2 = (h8  2) dx0dx0 + 2 (h8  1) dx0dx1 + h8dx1dx1 +(cid:0)

e = 1 ,

b = 0 .

(14)

the crucial step to get rid of the constant in the harmonic h8 function consists of perform-
ing rst an sl(2, r) coordinate transformation on the coordinates x0, x1 and subsequently
a t-duality transformation in the new x
1 direction. provided that we choose the special
sl(2, r) coordinate transformation

0 =
x

2 (cid:0)x0 + x1(cid:1) ,

x

(15)

we are guaranteed that the transformation is globally well-dened on (x0, x1) space, which
has the toplogy of a cylinder due to the compactication of x1. after t-duality in x1 di-
rection, the result is a modied fundamental string without constant part in the harmonic
function

it is important to note that the last t-duality has again been along a space-like direc-
tion. therefore we are secured to stay in the type ii string-theory framework instead of
changing to type ii* [11].

now, proceeding in the inverse manner, a second s-duality promotes us to a modi-
ed d1-brane. ultimately, with two t-dualities in the x2, x3 directions we end up with
a modied d3-brane solution without a constant part in its harmonic function. as is
well-known, this gives the ads5  s5 geometry.
