abstract. we show how to determine the unknown functions arising when the
peeling decomposition is applied to multi-critical matter coupled to two-dimensional
quantum gravity and compute the loop-loop correlation functions. the results that

1 introduction

one of the outstanding problems in the theory of two-dimensional quantum gravity
is the eect of matter elds on the hausdor dimension. in models of discretized
two-dimensional quantum gravity we dene the grand canonical partition function
for an ensemble of graphs (which for the moment we assume are triangulations) g
by

e|g|wg

(1)

z() =xgg

where |g| denotes the number of triangles in g, and wg the partition function of
any matter elds in the theory on the graph g (for an introduction to this material
see for example [1]). to dene the hausdor dimension [2, 3] we rst dene the
geodesic distance dg(i, j) between two links i and j as the minimum number of
triangles which must be traversed to get from the centre of one link to the centre of
the other. then we introduce the two-point function

h(r, ) =xgg

e|g|wg xi,jg

(dg(i, j)  r).

we expect that h has the asymptotic behaviour [3, 4]
m()r >> 1,
m()1 >> r >> 1,

h(r, )  em()r,
 r1,

where, as   c, the mass gap vanishes as

m()  (  c).

(2)

(3)

(4)

in general it is also convenient to consider a more general correlation function be-
tween boundary loops of length l1 and l2; (2) is essentially the correlator for minimum
length loops. note that it follows from (2) that

xr

h(r, ) = xgg

e|g||g|2wg

 (  c)

(5)

where  is the string susceptibility exponent, and inserting the form (3) we conclude
that

which is the fisher scaling relation. at least in unitary theories the hausdor
dimension dh is given by dh = 1 and has the geometrical meaning that in the

(2  ) = 

(6)

1

continuum limit the average volume is related to the geodesic size by hv i  rdh
[1].

analytic calculations of the scaling behaviour of the correlation functions (2)
were rst done by means of the slicing decomposition introduced by kawai et al [2]
and then somewhat later watabiki [5] introduced the peeling decomposition. for
pure gravity (ie wg = 1,  = 1/2) both peeling and slicing decompositions keep
track of the geodesic distance and give the same results which tell us directly that
the hausdor dimension of the ensemble is 4.

when matter elds are introduced the situation becomes more complicated. the
time scale, usually called the string time t, introduced in the decompositions that
have been formulated is no longer by construction the geodesic distance, nor indeed
are the time scales for dierent decompositions necessarily equivalent. however the
above discussion of correlation functions can be repeated in terms of the string time
t instead of the geodesic distance r leading to another pair of exponents, t and
t, which are also expected to satisfy the fisher scaling relation. for example in
the c = 2 model the scaling with string time has been calculated completely by
the peeling decomposition [6] with the result that t = 1
2 which would imply that
dh = 2 if the string time and geodesic distance are proportional.
in fact high
precision numerical calculations [7] nd dh = 3.58  0.04 in agreement with the
formula [8]

derived using scaling arguments for diusion in liouville theory. for unitary matter
complete calculations have not been made but it seems that t = ||/2 [9]; the
implied value of dh is in contradiction with the results of numerical simulations
which suggest that dh is close to 4 [10] but are not in particularly good agreement
with (7) either. it seems certain that when matter is present the string time and the
geodesic distance have dierent scaling dimensions but the relation between them
is unknown.

the (p, q) = (2, 2k  1), k = 2, 3, 4, . . . multi-critical models are a special case.
they have been analyzed using the slicing decomposition in the same way as pure
gravity [11]. provided we dene the geodesic distance as the minimum number of
polygons (for now polygons with up to 2k sides appear in the graphical expansion)
which must be traversed to get from the centre of one link to the centre of the
other the slicing decomposition does indeed track the geodesic distance. of course
this denition is slightly problematic for large k; it implies that all sides of a given
polygon are separated from one another by geodesic distance 1. these models have
also been considered using the peeling decomposition in the scaling limit but the

discretized equations have not been solved completely [5, 12]. in this paper we will
examine their peeling decomposition in detail and explain how to solve completely
the non-trivial dierential equations that arise. we have two motivations for this;
to check whether the results are indeed the same as for slicing, and the intrinsic
interest of the method of solution.

this paper is structured as follows. in section 2 we briey describe the standard
peeling calculation for pure gravity and then derive the evolution equation for the
multi-critical models. in section 3 we consider the k = 2 case and show that it
always gives the standard pure gravity results. then in section 4 we show in detail
how to calculate the  exponent for k = 4 and describe how the calculation extends
to all higher even k. in section 5 we explain how to calculate  for all even k and
in section 6 we give our conclusions.

2 the peeling decomposition and evolution equa-

tions

we start by reviewing the calculation in [5] for the simplest pure gravity model
which has potential

u() =

g3.

the schwinger dyson equation for connected greens functions is then obtained
by marking one external line and pulling it out to expose the vertex to which it is
attached [13], see g.(1). in the peeling decomposition we assign a time variable to
this process; a single iteration advances t by an amount 1/n so that we obtain

an(t + 1/n) = n,2 + gan+1(t) + g

am(t)anm+1(t).

(9)

nxm=1

we are interested in the loop-loop correlation function; suppose for the moment that
at t = 0 the entry loop is a one-loop and form the quantity

gn(t) =

an(t)
a1(0)

3

(10)

t

figure 2: the two-loop function in spherical topology.

which is the amplitude for an exit n-loop at time t given an entry 1-loop at time
t = 0. dierentiating (9) we obtain

gn(t + 1/n) = ggn+1(t) + 2g

nxm=1

am(t)gnm+1(t).

(11)

if we restrict to spherical topology then am(t) may be replaced by the disk amplitude
for m legs, am, because the branch can never rejoin the main tube (see g.(2)). the
next step is to approximate the time by a continuous variable to obtain the evolution
equation

gn(t) +

n

dgn(t)

dt

= ggn+1(t) + 2g

with the initial condition that

nxm=1

amgnm+1(t)

(12)

gn(0) =

an(0)
a1(0)

= n,1.

(13)

note that by dierentiating (12) we can show iteratively that all the derivatives of
gn(t) at t = 0 are nite. dening the generating function

g(t, x) =

g
t



= x

equation (12) becomes

where

f (x) = 2ga(x) + g  x,

(16)

and the form of the disk amplitude

a(x) =

anxn

xn=1

(17)

is known [9]. note that the function f (x) contains just the universal scaling part of
the amplitude a(x); it is given by

f (x) = (f  x)(1  8f g  4gx)

1

2

where f is the root of the cubic

(1  8f g)f 2  g2 = 0

(18)

(19)

which is positive and vanishes as g  0.
evolution equation which gives

it is then straightforward to solve the

where

g(t, x) =

x

f (x)

u(t + j(x))

=

f (x)

and the function u(y) is xed by the initial conditions to satisfy

1 =

1

f (x)

u(j(x)).

this leads to the scaling behaviour at large y

where  = c   and we have suppressed various constant factors; so we deduce
 = 1

4 and  = 4 in agreement with the fisher scaling relation [3].
now we turn to the multi-critical models for which we will use the notation of

reference [14]. the potential for the k-th multi-critical model is given by

u() = 2 +

gk
p 2p

kxp=1

where the couplings at the multicritical point are

this time we will deal with disconnected graphs. the evolution equation follows
from the schwinger-dyson equation, shown in g.3, just as in the pure gravity case;
we obtain the evolution equation

proceeding as before, but assuming that the entry loop is an m-loop and dening

we nd

with the initial condition that

2kgk

k gn+2k2,m(t)

(28)

gn,m(0) = n,m.

(29)

again, note that by dierentiating (28) we can show iteratively that all the deriva-
tives of gn,m(t) at t = 0 are nite.

dening the generating function

gm(x, t) =

xngn,m(t)

xn=1

(30)

we obtain the partial dierential equation

at this stage we should make several remarks. firstly that one reason for dealing
with the disconnected graphs is technical convenience; the required disk amplitudes
are known and take a simple form [14], and the structure of the evolution equations is
similar to the 3 case. however it is also very clear that because the graph ensemble
is disconnected there is no direct correspondence between the string time t and a
geodesic distance  the latter can only be sensibly dened on connected graphs.
these equations are more dicult to solve than the pure gravity example reviewed
above because of the presence of the a priori unknown functions gj,m(t) which have
to be determined by the self-consistency and analyticity properties of the solutions.
we will work our way through the problem in a number of steps. first we will study
the solution in the k = 2 case and show that it gives the standard pure gravity
results.

3 universality in the k = 2 case

it is simpler to work at the multi-critical points initially and to compute the 
exponent directly at the critical point; we leave the  exponent for section 5. for
the k = 2 multi-critical model we have

gm
t

= x



x(cid:0)gm(2x2a(x)  1  2g2

2 = 1/12 and a(x) is given by

where g2

1 = 1/2, g2

2x1g1,m(t)

a(x) =

thus gm satises

x1gm

t

=

(32)

(33)

(34)

(35)

with the initial condition

gm(0, x) = xm.

the potential (24) is an even function of the elds and therefore gn,m(t), which
is the amplitude for an entrance m-loop and exit n-loop, can only be non-zero of n
and m are both odd or both even. thus if m is odd there is an unknown function
on the r.h.s. of (34) whereas if m is even there is no such problem; we will consider
the even and odd cases separately.

7

3.1 even m

when m is even g1,m(t) = 0 and we can solve (34) immediately to obtain

gm(t, x) =

x

f (x)

u(t + j(x))

where

f (x) =

j(x) =

3

4(cid:16)(1  4x2) 1

2  1(cid:17) ,

and the function u(y) is determined by the initial condition (35)

thus we obtain

for large y and hence

xm =

f (x)

u(j(x)).

for even n and m so that  = 4 as expected for all these amplitudes.

3.2 odd m

when m is odd g1,m(t) 6= 0 and the presence of the unknown function on the r.h.s.
of (34) complicates matters; however this is more typical of the general multi-critical
models than the even m case and so we shall study it in some detail. although the
dierential equation can of course still be solved in the t domain it is more convenient
to work with the laplace transformed correlation functions

gn,m(t)estdt

gm(s, x) =

gm(t, x)estdt.

gn,m(s) =z 
xz 

1

0

0

taking the laplace transform of (34) we obtain the equation

sgm(s, x)  xm1 =



x(cid:0)gm(s, x)f (x)(cid:1) +

1
3x2 g1,m(s).

integrating this dierential equation we nd

gm(s, x) =

sg1,m(s)
(1  4y2)

(43)

the function gm(s, x) has a power series expansion in x

gm(s, x) =xn

xn1gn,m(s)

(44)

which we expect from (43) and (37) to have nite radius of convergence 1
2; within the
radius of convergence the coecients are the laplace transforms of the correlation
functions. unless the gn,m(t) grow faster than exponentially at large t, something
we do not expect, their laplace transforms gn,m(s) will have an asymptotic series
representation at large s. this series can be obtained by successive integration by
parts of the denition (41); as we observed in section 2, gn,m(t) and all its (nite
order) derivatives are nite at t = 0 so we obtain the formal series

gn,m(s) =

1

sxk=0

k
sk , 0 = n,m.

(45)

(of course the k depend on n and m but we will always suppress such dependence
for clarity.) we will now show that imposing the condition that the coecients
in the x expansion of gm(s, x) behave like (45) at large s is sucient to x the
unknown function g1,m(s).

it is more convenient to impose the condition on the integral of gm(s, x),

(46)

(47)

that is to say the small x, large s, expansion of gm contains no terms o(1) or higher
in s. substituting (45) and expanding the exponential in its taylor series (which is
of course allowed for all values of the argument) we get

(49)

first we show that this constraint alone implies that all higher powers of s vanish
as well; for o(s) we get

c1 =z x

(52)

provided x < 1

2. it follows that c1(x) is a constant; but c1(0) = 0 therefore

c1(x) = 0.

any pair ck(x) and ck+1(x), with k > 0 are related in the same way and so it is
straightforward to proceed inductively to show that all ck>0(x) are zero.
taking the laplace transform of (49) with respect to j we nd that

where x(j) is obtained by inverting (37). thus g1,m(s) is determined; making the
change of variables x = 1

2 tanh  and integrating by parts we get

g1,m(s) = r

4 s cosh  sech2 d

0 cosh  e 3

4 s cosh  d

.

(54)

it is clear that g1,m(s) is positive for all real, positive s and straightforward to
check that its second derivative with respect to s diverges logarithmically as s  0;
it follows that

g1,m(t) 

1
t3

(55)

at large t. the remaining integrals in (43) yield functions which are analytic in s in
the neighbourhood of the origin provided x < xc. thus we can conclude that

gn,m(t) 

1
t3

(56)

for all odd n and m. so the result  = 4 is universal for all amplitudes gn,m(t) in
agreement with every other calculation for pure gravity.

10

in fact g1,m(s) can be xed more simply by examining (43). as x  xc, j(x)
diverges and hence gm(s, x) grows faster than exponentially in s, which is impossible,

r are easy to compute. the function u0(y) is xed by the

xm1 =

f (x)

u0(j(x))

and the functions ujk(y) by requiring that (60) is a solution of (58),

xj2k+1 =

1

f (x)

11

ujk(j(x)).

because of the unknown functions gj,m(t), (60) is not of course a complete solution.
note that j(x) is always an even function which diverges as |x|  1
2 and which is
positive for even k and negative for odd k. to determine the critical behaviour
from the properties at large t we need to know the behaviour of the functions u0( )
and ujk( ) for large positive argument. for even k we see by considering (62) and
(63) as |x|  1

2 that

u0( )

ujk( )

    2k1

(64)

however for odd k only the large negative argument behaviour is determined. this
phenomenon always occurs in calculations for the multi-critical models. extrapolat-
ing the solution to positive time leads to a singularity at nite time; it seems to us
quite likely that this is an artefact of the truncation of the original nite dierence
equation (26) into a rst order dierential equation (28) and that the solution may
be stabilised by higher derivative terms. from now on we will concentrate on the
even k models and start by studying the k = 4 case in detail.

4.1 k = 4, even m

as for the k = 2 model we will consider the cases of even and odd m separately.
for even m we have

(69)

note the appearance of g6,m(s) in (68); this happens because f (x) is singular at
x = 0 which makes the evaluation of the limits of integration slightly non-trivial.

in order to full the constraint that gm(s, x) has the correct small x, large s, ex-
pansion. in fact we can immediately determine g6,m(s) as explained at the end of
section 2 by requiring that gm(s, x) does not grow faster than any exponential of s
as x  1

2 which implies that

gm(s,

) = 0

(73)

and so g6,m(s) is related to g2,m(s) and g4,m(s) which still have to be determined.

(of course the ,  and  coecients depend on m but we have suppressed this to
avoid clutter) and substituting into (71) we obtain the o(s0) constraint

(75)

identical manipulations to the k = 2 case show that c0 = 0 ensures ck>0 = 0
also. there are in fact three separate constraints hidden in (75) which are sucient
to determine the k, k and k coecients. to see this we proceed by writing
everything in terms of j. j(x) is an even function with a small x expansion

j(x) =

35
6

x6 +

245

x8 + . . .

so it follows that, by reverting the series,

ak(j

xk=0

(76)

(77)

where we take the real positive cube root of j (remember that m is even and again
we suppress the m dependence on ak). similarly we have

now suppose that 0 . . . n 1 and 0 . . . n 1 are known; from (81) we can obtain
0 . . . n 1. then (82) contains only these known coecients together with n which
is thus determined. now (83) determines n . knowing 0 . . . n 1 and 0 . . . n 1
we now determine n from (81). proceeding in this way all the coecients, and thus
the right hand sides of (74), can be obtained iteratively. to analyse the asymptotic
behaviour of the correlation functions we need to know the behaviour of g2,m(s) etc
at small s. resumming the relations (81), (82), and (83), and using the integral

these three equations determine the unknown functions that we need.

these expressions have the expected properties; they are positive and decreasing
functions of s for small positive s. it follows from (101) that g2,m(t), g4,m(t) and

g6,m(t) all have the same asymptotic behaviour at large t namely

gj,m(t)  t 7

(102)

for j = 2, 4, 6 and hence the exponent  = 12/5. to determine the behaviour of
the higher correlation functions it is simplest to return to (68). all the integrals
yield functions of s which are analytic in some neighbourhood of the origin provided
x < 1/2 and so we can conclude that every coecient of the x expansion of gm(x, t)
behaves the same way and that (102) is valid for all (even) j and m.

thus we can conclude that the exponent  always takes the value 12/5 in the k = 4
model.

next examine the roots of the equation

which can be rewritten as a degree 2k  3 polynomial equation for u  x2 taking
the generic form

(1 + a)2(1  4u)2k3  (1 + b1u + . . . + bk2uk2)2 = 0

(110)

where a, b1, . . . bk2 are constants. there are k  1 roots which vanish at  = 0
and k  2 roots which do not; the k  1 vanishing roots correspond to the k  1

20

odd m, (104), can be merged into the form (113); for any xed m we have k  1
equations for k  1 unknowns.

restricting ourselves to even m all the integrals in (113) can be written as linear

combinations of

up to and including the rst positive power of s and so they can be separated into
three classes;

1. p < k  1; the integrals are divergent as s  0 but the singularities of the
integrand are integrable at z = 0 so the contour can be deformed as shown in
g.(7)b. the integral from the starting point to the rst blob is given by

cut on the positive real axis is suppressed for clarity.

the portion of the contour between the two blobs gives no contribution and
the leg stretching out to innity gives

to obtain the integral up to the desired order the second exponential factor
can be taylor expanded and then integrated term by term.

2. p = k  1; after an integration by parts the above construction can be used

and we get

2(2k  3)kk1 = (2k  3)(cid:18)1  (hk

0 sei2n)

1

2k3 (cid:18)2k  4

2k  3(cid:19)(cid:19) + . . . . (119)

3. p > k  1; the leading non-analytic term is of higher order than we need to

consider so

2(2k  3)kp =

2k  3

2p  2k + 3

.

(120)

now observe that in all these integrals s always appears with a factor ei2n and
that there are no other phase factors. thus all of the constraint equations (113) can
be obtained from the n = 0 case by making the replacement s  sei2n. they can
thus be written in the form

f0(sei2n) +

k1xp=1

fp(sei2n)g

c
2p,m(s) = 0

(121)

fp(w) = w1 k1xq=0

fp,qw

2q

2k3 + fp,kw + . . .! .

(122)

we have truncated the expansion of fp(w) in anticipation of the following. the
equations (121) can now be written in the matrix form

 df + s

1

2k3 f0,k1 +  d f g + s

1

2k3 f g = 0

(123)

where

= exp (i2(k/2 + p)(1 + 2q/(2k  3))) ,
= pqs2(p1)/(2k3)1,

d

(124)

now d is clearly non-singular and it is straightforward to check that  is non-
singular. there does not seem to be any simple way of writing the elements of f for
general k but we expect it too is non-singular. then the leading order solution for
g is a constant vector; furthermore the next term in the solution is o(s2/(2k3)).
we have already shown by explicit solution that this is indeed what happens for
k = 4; using maple we have also checked it for k = 6, 8, 10. it follows that

 =

4(k  1)
2k  3

(125)

c

for the correlation functions g

p,m, p = 2, 4, . . . 2(k  1). the relationship (108)
c
p,m and gp,m is non-singular so this conclusion applies also to gp,m, p =
between g
2, 4, . . . 2(k  1). finally we note as usual that the integrals in (107) are analytic
functions of s in the neighbourhood of the origin provided x < 1/2 so the conclusion
extends to all the correlation functions.

5 the  exponent

to nd  we need to study the scaling behaviour as the multi-critical point is
approached and to do this consider the modied couplings

gk
1 = gk
1
gk
p = (1  )gk
p ,

p  2.

23

(126)

in the graphical expansion the power of 1   is the number of vertices in the
graph, and therefore  is the coupling constant in terms of which the mass gap
scaling should satisfy the fisher relation discussed in section 1. by denition the
multi-critical point is attained as   0. the disk amplitude a(x) can still be
calculated by exploiting the connection with topological gravity [14]; the topological
potential is

v (z) =   kz + z + (1  )(1  z)k

and the disk amplitude

a(, x) = ic

dz
2i

(1  4zx2) 1

2 (1  v (z)) log

z  v (z)

z

(127)

(128)

where the contour encircles the branch cut of the logarithm. the branch points are
at z = 0 and

z =

zc
4  1  k1/k

where k is a constant. collapsing the contour onto the cut gives

a(, x) = kz zc

0

integrating we nd that

dy(1  4yx2) 1

2(cid:0) + (1  )(1  y)k1(cid:1)

f (x)  x 2x2a(, x)  1

(129)

(130)

(131)

(132)

(133)

which reproduces (59) when  = 0.

at small x, even for nite  we still get the leading behaviour

f (x)  x32k

which implies that

j(x) =z x

0

dy
f (y)  x2k2.

thus the considerations described in detail for k = 4 in section 4 up to equation
(87) go through as before  the only dierence is that all the various coecients
are now functions of . however the contours pi are modied; when we make the
change of variable (96)

 = j (ui)

24

(134)

the  =  endpoint of the contour occurs at the value of ui where j diverges. the
points where j diverges are of course determined by the zeros of f . dening w
through

x2 = zc + k1/kw

(135)

we get using (131)

j (w) = j(cid:0)u = (zc + k1/kw)1(cid:1) =

(k1/k )

the term k in the denominator is sub-leading; its only eect is to shift the zeros
by an amount o(1/k) and we discard it to obtain

j (w) =

note that the denominator has precisely k1 simple zeroes; one is real and positive
and the others come in complex conjugate pairs. each zero is the end-point of one of
the k  1 contours, see g.(8). since we will only need the leading scaling behaviour

close to the end-point we get

log

w + wl
w  wl

+ ql(cid:19)

where ql is the accumulated nite contribution from all the other poles in (138).
note that the branch cut for the square roots is taken down the negative real axis
so that rewl > 0 for all l. inverting (139) we nd that

tl exp (13/2kslj )  1!2
w = wl tl exp(cid:0)13/2kslj(cid:1) + 1

where sl and tl are (complex) constants of o(1). it turns out that the quantity

rl/wl is never pure imaginary and thus resl 6= 0; except for the single real root,

sl is not purely real either and hence the correlation functions have some oscillatory
behaviour which is typical of a non-unitary theory. the formula (140) is valid for
j  ; expanding we get

w = wl 1 +

(l)

n exp(cid:16)n13/2k slj(cid:17)!

where

sl = sl,

if resl > 0,

if resl < 0.

(140)

(141)

(142)

(143)

(144)

(145)

(146)

using (135) and (141) we see that the conditions (113) can be written in the form

0 =

where a(n)

l

and m (n) are collections of coecients and

m (0)
pq

= (zc + k1/kwp)k1q.

the apparent singularity in (143) at s = 0 is of course not present provided m (0) is
invertible. m (0) is of the vandermonde form and therefore

det m (0) = (k1/k)(k1)(k2)/2yp>q

(wp  wq).

since none of the roots are degenerate m (0) is invertible. therefore the rst non-
analyticity occurs at s  13/2k and hence the mass gap exponent is

3
2k

 = 1 

26

6 discussion

we have found that  = 1  3/2k and  = 2 + 2/(2k  3) and therefore, since  =
1/k, the fisher scaling relation (6) is indeed satised. the results show that the
functions which are initially undetermined in the peeling calculation do not in fact
change the conclusions one would draw simply by ignoring their contribution in (60).
the value of  agrees with that obtained by slicing [11]. to compare  it is necessary
to examine the continuum limit for the perturbation away from the multicritical
point (126). by denition boundary loops with l legs in the dual graph (ie which
are l links long) have continuum length l = la where a is the length of one link.
this implies that the generating function variable x conjugate to l must be related
to a continuum quantity x by x = xceax where xc is the radius of convergence of
the disk amplitude (131). we can construct a non-trivial continuum disk amplitude

ac(e, x) provided that   eak where e is some continuum coupling (not, of

course, the cosmological constant unless k = 2); we obtain

a(, x) = a0(, x)  ak1/2ac(e, x) + . . .

where a0 is the analytic (non-universal) part of the disk amplitude. using this
scaling for  in the large r behaviour of the two-point function we nd that

(147)

(148)

exp(r) = exp(e(rak)) = exp(er)

and hence we will get a consistent non-trivial scaling limit provided the continuum
geodesic distance r  rak. this also agrees with [11]. now consider a perturbation
in terms of the cosmological constant  which has dimension a2. then we would
expect to nd that the two point function behaves as

exp(

k

2 r).

(149)

the average volume of the system will be hv i  1; on the other hand from (149)
the geodesic size must be of order rs   k
s which implies
that the hausdor dimension is dh = 2

2 and hence hv i  r

k .

2

k

the multi-critical models are non-unitary and have negative central charge, and
so one might think that their hausdor dimension would be given by (7) which
works well for the c = 2 model. however it is simple to check that (7) gives
irrational values for dh when k > 2 and hence must disagree with the decomposition
calculations. it seems clear that the geodesic distance dened by the decompositions
for general k cannot be equivalent to the denition assumed in [8].
