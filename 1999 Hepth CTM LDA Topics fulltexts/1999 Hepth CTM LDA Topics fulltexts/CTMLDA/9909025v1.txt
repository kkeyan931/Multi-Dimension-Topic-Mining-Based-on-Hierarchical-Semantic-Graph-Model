we consider typeiia supergravity solution of d2-branes and d3-branes localized within d6-
branes in the near-core region of d6-branes. with these solutions we can calculate the spectrum of
the glueball mass in qcd3 and qcd4. the equation of motion describing the dilaton has the same
eigenvalues and the same glueball masses in qcd3 and qcd4. glueball mass spectrum is the same
in the near core region of d6-branes of their m-theory counterpart is kk monopole. we conclude
that the glueball mass spectrum is the same in qcd3 and qcd4 by considering the near-core limit
of d6-branes of which m-theory counterpart (kk monopole background) becomes an ale space
with an an 1 singularity times 7 dimensional minkowski space m (6,1).

i. introduction

recent conjecture of relating the large n behavior
of certain gauge theories to semi-classical supergravity
leads to a motivation for special solutions describing
regions close to the cores of the brane.
in addition to
this, supergravity solutions representing branes ending
on branes like hanany-witten [1] conguration are im-
portant.

in this note we discuss some explicit solutions for
branes which are completely localized within other
branes. the 1/4 supersymmetric solutions describe only
the region close to the core of the bigger brane. su-
pergravity solutions describing branes(d2-branes or ns
5-branes or waves)localized within d6-branes in the re-
gion close to the core of the d6-brane are already known.
[2]

the d2-branes localized on d6-branes are t-dual to a
case of the background describing (d) strings localized
on (d)5-branes and this is also related to a localized
intersection of m2-branes and m5-branes. by u-duality
and/or lifting d = 10 solutions to d = 11 other string
theory and m-theory near-core localized solutions are
found.

in section 2 we can calculate the mass spectrum of
some glueballs with this supergravity solution. we found
considering d6-branes in the near-core limit is that their
m-theory counterpart (kk monopole background [3]) be-
comes an ale space with an an 1 singularity times a
7-dimensional minkowski space m (6,1).

in section 3, let us consider n m2-branes along 2+1
directions in m (6,1). n m2-branes along 2+1 directions
in m (6,1) are invariant under zn identications and the

eleven-dimensional background will be given by the m2
brane solutions with the zn identications in transverse
in the metric obtained in this way, the o++
space.
glueball spectrum can be calculated and this calculation
corresponds to the glueball mass spectrum in qcd3. [4]
this m2-brane solution is related to ten dimensions to
obtain a typeiia solution which can be interpreted as the
near-core region of a conguration of d2-branes localized
within a collection of d6-branes.

in section 4, we also suppose n m3-branes along 3+1
directions in m (6,1). this m3 branes along 3+1 direc-
tions in m (6,1) are invariant under zn identications and
eleven dimensional background will be given by the m3
solutions with the zn identication in transverse space.
the glueball mass spectrum in this supergravity solution
corresponds to glueball mass in qcd4.

the dilaton equations of motion are the same in the
3 near-core limits of their m-theory counterpart is kk
monopole. in conclusion, the glueball mass spectrum in
qcd3 and qcd4 has the same results in this near-core
limits and this mass spectrum is unique for this back-
ground.

ii. d2-branes localized on d6-branes

in the near core region of typeiia solution for a col-
lection of n d6-branes upon dimension reduction of the
an 1 space [5], the metric is

where glueball mass m 2 is equal to k2. since y = 0 is
regular and y =  is irregular singular point, we assume
f in the following form.

with the zn identication of ( , )  ( , )+( 2

after the reduction to ten dimensions by using killing

since f has the unique solution for a certain value of
k2, this is an eigenvalue problem. the o++ glueball mass
m 2 is k2.

iii. d2-branes within d6-branes

let us consider a conguration of m2-branes stretched
along x1, x2 directions. [7] in this situation we shall put
all of them at the origin in the transverse space. in this
case, the metric is

where x3, x4, x5, x6 are the coordinates along the d6-

assuming  = f (y )eikx, we get the same eigenvalue
of k2 for the above equation and o++ glueball mass m 2
is equal to k2.

,where x4, x5, x6 are the coordinates along d6-brane
where qcd3 lives while y is the radial coordinate of the
space. if we follow the same procedure for the d2+d6
case, we can conclude that the equation of motion for
the dilaton is the same form as equation (17).

iv. d3-branes within d6-branes

along x1, x2, x3 directions. [8], [9] the metric is

we have found that how glueball mass spectrum can
be derived from the maldacenas conjecture in the near-
core limit. the glueball mass spectrum is the same for
qcd3 and qcd4 in the kk monopole background.

in my next research, i will do calculations of the glue-
ball mass spectrum as an eigenvalue problem of the equa-
tion of motion for dilaton in this work. the result can
be compared with the lattice calculation. [10], [11]

it would be very important to understand whether
the coincidence of glueball mass spectrum for qcd3 and
qcd4 is only for kk monopole background or whether
this fact is for the same background.
