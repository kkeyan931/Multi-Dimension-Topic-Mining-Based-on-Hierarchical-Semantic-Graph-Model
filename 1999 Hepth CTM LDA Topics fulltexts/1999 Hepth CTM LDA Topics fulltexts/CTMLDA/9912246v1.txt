abstract

a model for quantized gravitation based on the simplicial lattice discretization is studied in detail using

a comprehensive nite size scaling analysis combined with renormalization group methods. the results are

consistent with a value for the universal critical exponent for gravitation  = 1/3, and suggest a simple

relationship between newtons constant, the gravitational correlation length and the observable average

space-time curvature. some perhaps testable phenomenological implications of these results are discussed.

to achieve a high numerical accuracy in the evaluation of the lattice path integral a dedicated parallel

machine was assembled.

1 introduction

one of the outstanding problems in theoretical physics is a determination of the quantum-mechanical

properties of einsteins relativistic theory of gravitation. approaches based on linearized perturbation

methods have had moderate success so far, as the underlying theory is known not to be perturbatively re-

normalizable [1, 2]. due to the complexity of even such approximate calculations a fundamental coupling of

the theory, the bare cosmological constant term, is usually set to zero thus further restricting the potential

physical relevance of the results. in addition gravitational elds are themselves the source for gravitation

already at the classical level, which leads to the problem of a intrinsically non-linear theory, where pertur-

bative results are possibly of doubtful validity for suciently strong eective couplings. this is especially

true in the quantum domain, where large uctuations in the gravitational eld appear at short distances. in

general nonperturbative eects can give rise to novel behavior in a quantum eld theory, and in particular

to the emergence of non-trivial xed points of the renormalization group (a phase transition in statistical

mechanics language). it has been realized for some time that in general the universal low and high energy

behavior of eld theories is almost completely determined by the xed point structure of the renormalization

group trajectories [3].

the situation described above bears some resemblance to the theory of strong interactions, quantum

chromodynamics. non-linear eects are known here to play an important role, and end up restricting the

validity of perturbative calculations to the high energy, short distance regime, where the eective gauge

coupling can be considered weak due to asymptotic freedom [4]. for low energy properties wilsons discrete

lattice formulation, combined with the renormalization group and computer simulations, has provided so far

the only convincing evidence for quark connement and chiral symmetry breaking, two phenomena which

are invisible to any order in the weak coupling, perturbative expansion.

a discrete lattice formulation can be applied to the problem of quantizing gravitation. instead of con-

tinuous metric elds, one deals with gravitational degrees of freedom which live only on discrete space-time

points and interact locally with each other. in regges simplicial formulation of gravity [5] one approximates

the functional integration over continuous metrics by a discretized sum over piecewise linear simplicial ge-

ometries [6, 7, 8, 9]. in such a model, the role of the continuum metric is played by the edge lengths of the

simplices, while curvature is described by a set of decit angles, which can be computed via known formulae

as functions of the given edge lengths. the simplicial lattice formulation of gravity is locally gauge invariant

[10] and can be shown to contain perturbative gravitons in the lattice weak eld expansion [6], making it an

attractive and faithful lattice regularization of the continuum theory.

2

the discretized theory is restricted to a nite set of dynemical variables, once a set of suitable boundary

conditions are imposed such as periodic or with some assigned boundary manifold. in the end the original

continuum theory of gravity is to be recovered as the space-time volume is made large and the fundamental

lattice spacing of the discrete theory is sent to zero. possibly without having to rely, at least in principle,

on any further approximation to the original continuum theory.

quantum uctuations in the underlying geometry are represented in the discrete theory by uctuations

in the edge lengths, which can be modeled by a well-dened, and numerically exact, stochastic process.

in analogy with other eld theory models studied by computer, calculations are usually performed in the

euclidean imaginary time framework, which is the only formulation amenable to a controlled numerical study,

at least for the immediate foreseeable future. the monte-carlo method, based on the concept of importance

sampling, is well suited for evaluating the discrete path integral for gravity and for computing the required

averages and correlation functions. by a careful and systematic analysis of the lattice results, the critical

exponents can be extracted, and the scaling properties of invariant correlation functions determined from

rst principles.

studies on small lattices suggest a rich scenario for the ground state of quantum gravity [7, 9, 11, 12]. the

present evidence indicates that simplicial quantum gravity in four dimensions exhibits a phase transition (in

the bare coupling g) between two phases: a strong coupling phase, in which the geometry is smooth at large

scales and quantum uctuations in the gravitational eld eventually average out and are bounded; and a

weak coupling phase, in which the geometry is degenerate and space-time collapses into a lower-dimensional

manifold, bearing some physical resemblance to a branched polymer. only the smooth, small negative

curvature and thus anti-desitter-like phase appears to be physically acceptable. phrased in dierent terms,

the two phases of quantized gravity found in [12], can loosely be described as having in one phase (with

bare coupling g < gc, the rough branched polymer-like phase)

while in the other (with bare coupling g > gc, the smooth phase),

hgi = 0 ,

hgi  c  ,

(1.1)

(1.2)

with a vanishingly small negative average curvature in the vicinity of the critical point at gc. the existence

of a phase transition at nite coupling g, usually associated in quantum eld theory with the appearance

of an ultraviolet xed point of the renormalization group, implies in principle non-trivial, calculable non-

perturbative scaling properties for correlations and eective coupling constants, and in particular in the case

at hand for newtons gravitational constant. since only the smooth phase with g > gc has acceptable

physical properties, one would conclude on the basis of fairly general renormalization group arguments that

3

at least in this lattice model the gravitational coupling can only increase with distance. furthermore, the

rise of the gravitational coupling in the infrared region rules out the applicability of perturbation theory to

the low energy domain, to the same extent that such an approach is deemed to be inapplicable to study the

low-energy properties of asymptotically free gauge theories.

it is a remarkable property of quantum eld theories that a wide variety of physical properties can

be determined from a relatively small set of universal quantities [13]. namely the universal leading critical

exponents, computed in the vicinity of some xed point (or xed line) of the renormalization group equations.

in the lattice theory the presence of a xed point or phase transition is often inferred from the appearance

of non-analytic terms in invariant local averages, such as for example the average curvature

< l2 >

<r d4xg r(x) >
<r d4xg >

 r(k) kkc ar (kc  k)41 ,

(1.3)

where k = 1/8g. from such averages one can determine the value for , the correlation length exponent,

(k) kkc

a (kc  k) .

(1.4)

an equivalent result, relating the quantum expectation value of the curvature to the physical correlation

length  , is

r() kkc

1/4 .

(1.5)

matching of dimensionalities in these equations is restored by supplying appropriate powers of the ultraviolet
cuto, the planck length lp = g. the exponent  is known to be related to the derivative of the beta
function for g in the vicinity of the ultraviolet xed point,

(gc) = 1/ .

(1.6)

in addition, the correlation length  itself determines the long-distance decay of the connected, invariant

two-point correlations at xed geodesic distance d. for the curvature correlation one has for distances much

larger compared to the correlation length

< g r(x) g r(y) (|x  y|  d) >c d  

d ed/ ,

while for shorter distances one expects a slower power law decay

< g r(x) g r(y) (|x  y|  d) >c d  

1

d 2 (41/)

.

(1.7)

(1.8)

the possibility of non-trivial scaling dimensions in the theory of gravitation is not new and was pointed out

some time ago in a series of interesting papers [14]. moreover it is easy to see that the scale dependence of

the eective newton constant is given by

g(r) = g(0)h 1 + c (r/)1/ + o((r/)2/ )i ,

4

(1.9)

with c a calculable numerical constant. in this last expression the momentum scale 1 plays a role similar

to the scaling violation parameter ms of qcd. it seems natural, although paradoxical at rst, to associate
 with some macroscopic cosmological length scale, such as the hubble distance ch 1

0 , with the lack of

screening of gravitational interactions ultimately accounting for such an unusual interpretation [12, 15]. of

course an increase of the gravitational coupling at large distances signals a likely breakdown of perturbation

theory for computing low energy properties of gravity.

it should be clear, even from this brief discussion, that the critical exponents by themselves already

provide a signicant amount of useful information about the continuum theory. in reality, the complexity of

the lattice interactions and the practical need to sample many statistically independent eld congurations

contributing to the path integral, which is necessary for correctly incorporating into the model the eects

of quantum-mechanical uctuations, leads to the requirement of powerful computational resources. the

results presented in this paper were obtained using a dedicated custom-built 20-gflop 64-processor parallel

computer, described in detail in [16].

finally one should mention that recently there has been a signicant resurgence of interest in the classical

applications of the regge formulation to gravity. a description of the methods as applied to several aspects

of the initial value problem in general relativity can be found in the recent references in [17]. for a related

approach to lattice gravity based on dynamical triangulations see also [18].

a brief outline of the paper is as follows. section 2. contains a discussion of general and nite size scaling

and related issues as they apply to the lattice theory of gravity. section 3. touches on the issue of the

unboundedness of the euclidean gravitational action. section 4. denes local curvature averages and their

uctuations, while section 5. introduces a set of exact sum rules for averages which follow from the scaling

properties of the partition function. section 6. denes a set of invariant correlations and discusses how they

relate to the local uctuations dened previously. section 7. includes a general discussion of the expected

properties of the theory in the presence of an ultraviolet xed point, including expectations based on the

analytical 2 +  expansion. in section 8. the numerical results are presented. section 9. contains a discussion

of the possible future physical relevance of the results, while section 10. contains the conclusions.

2 finite size scaling

one of the most important quantities used in establishing the continuum limit of a lattice eld theory are

the critical exponents. reliable estimates for the exponents in a lattice eld theory require a comprehensive

nite-size analysis, a procedure by which accurate values for the critical exponents are obtained by taking

5

into account the linear size dependence of the result computed in a nite volume v . one starts from the

general euclidean action (or statistical mechanics hamiltonian)

h = xi

gi oi

(2.10)

with gi the coupling associated with the operator oi. in the gravitational case the couplings would correspond
to the bare cosmological constant, the newtonian gravitational constant and the higher derivative coupling.
close to a renormalization group xed point denoted by {g
linearized renormalization group transformation, such that

i } one chooses the ois to be eigenvectors of the

gi  g

i  byi(gi  g
i )

,

(2.11)

where b is the scale factor of the transformation. in the simplest statistical mechanics systems, such as a

ferromagnet in the absence of an external magnetic eld, one has o  h as the only relevant operator (in
the sense that y > 0), and g  t = t  tc. as will be discussed below, in the gravitational case the role of
t is played by the bare gravitational coupling g. additional operators appearing in the action are classied

as marginal (y = 0) or irrelevant. the relevance of the energy operator reects the fact that close to the

critical point t is the only parameter that needs to be tuned to achieve criticality, synonymous with long

range correlations. universality of critical behavior then accounts for the fact that many diverse physical

systems exhibit the same scaling behavior in the vicinity of the critical point, as a consequence of a divergent

correlation length [13].

in practice the renormalization group approach is brought in via a slightly dierent route, involving a

change in the overall linear size of the system. the usual starting point for the derivation of the scaling

properties of the theory is the renormalization group (rg) behavior of the free energy f =  log z/v

f (t,{uj}) = freg(t,{uj}) + bd fsing(byt t,{byj uj}) ,

(2.12)

where fsing is the singular, non-analytic part of the free energy, and freg is the regular part. b is the block

size in the rg transformation, while yt and yj(j  2) are the relevant eigenvalues of the rg transformation
(for more details see the review [19]). one denotes here by yt > 0 the relevant eigenvalue, while the remaining
eigenvalues yj  0 are associated with either marginal or irrelevant operators. usually y1
the next subleading exponent y2 is denoted .

is called , while

t

the correlation length  determines the asymptotic decay of correlations, in the sense that one expects

for example for the two-point function at large distances

< o(x)o(y) >

|xy|  

e|xy|/

.

(2.13)

6

the scaling equation for the correlation length itself

(t) = b  (bytt)

implies for b = t1/yt that   t with a correlation length exponent

 = 1/yt .

(2.14)

(2.15)

derivatives of the free energy f with respect to t then determine, after setting the scale factor b = t1/yt ,

the scaling properties of physical observables, including corrections to scaling [20]. thus for example, the

second derivative of the free energy with respect to t yields the specic heat exponent  = 2 d/yt = 2 d,

2
t2 f (t,{uj})  t(2d)

.

(2.16)

in the gravitational case one identies the scaling eld t with kc  k, where k = 1/16g involves the
bare newtons constant. the appearance of singularities in physical averages, obtained from appropriate

derivatives of f , is rooted in the fact that close to the critical point at t = 0 the correlation length diverges.

the above results can be extended to the case of a nite lattice of volume v and linear dimension

l = v 1/d. the volume-dependent free energy is then written as

f (t,{uj}, l1) = freg(t,{uj}) + bd fsing(bytt,{byj uj}, b/l)

.

(2.17)

for b = l (a lattice consisting of only one point) one obtains the finite size scaling (fss) form of the free

energy (for a detailed presentation of this procedure see [21]; see also [22, 23] for a eld-theoretic justication).

after taking derivatives with respect to the elds t and {uj}, the fss scaling form for physical observables
follows. for a quantity o diverging like txo in the innite volume limit one has

o(l, t) = lxo/ (cid:20) fo(cid:18) l

(, t)(cid:19) + o(, l)(cid:21) ,

(2.18)

with fo a smooth scaling function, and (, t) the innite volume correlation length. for suciently large
volumes the correction to scaling term involving  can be neglected, but in general one needs to be aware

of their presence if either the volumes are not large enough or if the corrections are large due to a large

amplitude or small exponent. some properties of the scaling function fo(y) can be deduced on general

grounds: it is expected to show a peak if the nite volume value for o is peaked, it is analytic at x = 0 since
no singularity can develop in a nite volume, and fo(y)  yxo for large y for a quantity o which diverges
as txo in the innite volume limit.

the last expression is useful when the innite-volume correlation length is known. but since close to the

critical point   t, one can deduce the equivalent scaling from

o(l, t) = lxo/ h fo (l t) + o(l)i

,

7

(2.19)

which relies on a knowledge of t, and thus of the critical point, instead. for a state of the art application of

the above methods to the 3-d ising model see [24].

the previous discussion applies to continuous, second order phase transitions. first order phase transi-

tions are driven by instabilities, and are in general not governed by any renormalization group xed point.

the underlying reason is that the correlation length does not diverge at the transition point, and thus the

system never becomes scale invariant. exponents for continuous, second order phase transition in general

obey the rigorous bound

yt < d

or

 > 1/d .

(2.20)

first order phase transition in renormalization group theory, on the other hand, can be associated with the

somewhat pathological case  = 1/d, for which the rst derivative of the free energy develops a step-function

singularity. in a renormalization group framework the corresponding pseudo-critical point is denoted as a

discontinuity xed point [25].

in the simplest case, a rst order transition develops as the system tunnels between two neighboring

minima of the free energy.

in the metastable branch the free energy acquires a complex part with an

essential singularity in the coupling located at the rst order transition point [26, 27]. as a consequence, such

a singularity is not generally visible from the stable branch, in the sense that a power series expansion in the

temperature is unaected by such a singularity. indeed in the innite volume limit the singularity associated

with a rst order transition at tc becomes innitely sharp, like a  or -function type singularity. the
singularity in the free energy at the endpoint of the metastable branch (at say t ) then cannot be explored

directly, it has to reached by an analytic continuation from the stable side of the free energy branch.

3 unboundedness of the euclidean theory

perturbation theory on a lattice and in the continuum suggests the presence of an instability in the eu-

clidean formulation for suciently smooth manifold. it is also known that the above instability is associated

with the appearance of a wrong sign for the conformal mode. on the lattice the instability seems to persist

close to the critical point [12], which suggests that the continuum limit has to be reached by some sort

of analytic continuation from the stable phase towards the critical point, naturally dened as the point in

coupling constant space where the correlation length diverges.

in the weak-eld expansion [28] the einstein-hilbert action contains both spin two (graviton) and spin

zero (conformal mode) contributions. in the continuum one can by a judicious choice of invariant correlation

functions isolate physical properties of the graviton from the conformal mode. a similar result holds on

8

the lattice, as can be seen by expanding the regge action about a regular lattice and using the fact that

the lattice and continuum actions are equivalent for suciently smooth manifolds [6, 29]. in general, after

expanding the metric around at space (which requires  = 0),

g =  + 16g h

,

one can cast the lowest order quadratic contribution to the action in the form

ie[h] = 1

2z d4x hvh ,

(3.21)

(3.22)

where v is a matrix which can be expressed in terms of spin projection operators. in momentum space it

can be written as

where p (2) and p (0) are spin two and spin zero projection operators introduced in [30]. physically, the two

v =(cid:2)p (2)  2p (0)(cid:3) p2

,

(3.23)

terms correspond to the propagation of the graviton and of the conformal mode, respectively, with the latter

one appearing with the wrong sign. in the landau gauge, with a gauge xing term 1(h)2 and

 = 0, one obtains for the graviton propagator in momentum space

g(p) =

p (2)

p2 

1

2 p (0)

p2

.

(3.24)

the unboundedness of the euclidean gravitational action shows up clearly in the weak eld expansion, with

the spin zero mode acquiring a propagator term with the wrong sign. 2 it has been argued that in weak eld

perturbation theory and in order to avoid the unboundedness problem one should perform the functional

integral over metrics by distorting the integration contour so as to include complex conformal factors [31].

one drawback of this prescription is that it only appears applicable within the framework of perturbation

theory. for a recent review of the euclidean instability problem see [32].

in the presence of a cosmological constant, things are further complicated by the fact that since at space

is no longer a solution of the classical equations of motion, and the above expansion for the metric looses part

of its meaning due to the presence of the tadpole term. but after shifting to the correct 0-th order solution,

a similar result is obtained. one can further modify the action to include additional invariant terms, but

things do not get any better. in the presence of higher derivative terms in the gravitational action, the above

result is modied by terms o(p4), and becomes [33]

g(p) =

p (2)

p2 + 2a

k p4

+

1

2 p (0)
p2 + a



k p4

.

(3.25)

2it should be noted that such an instability is not peculiar to gravitation. indeed the euclidean path integral for the one-
dimensional coulomb potential, an otherwise completely well behaved quantum mechanical system, already exhibits such an
instability. it would be premature to conclude from such a result that the problem is physically ill-posed.

9

the p4 terms improve the ultraviolet behavior of the theory, but do not remove the unboundedness problem,

which re-appears for suciently small p2, in the low momentum or long-distance limit. moreover, the

resulting theory is most likely not unitary unless the coupling a is vanishingly small. the lack of positivity

of physical correlations for a > 0 can be seen explicitly even in a non-perturbative treatment [34], and makes

such a modied theory of gravitation in the end somewhat unattractive.

4 local averages and fluctuations

in the following the relevant denitions for gravitational averages and correlations on the lattice will be

briey recalled, in a form which will be used in later sections. the starting point for a non-perturbative

study of quantum gravity is a suitable denition of the discrete feynman path integral. in the simplicial

lattice approach one starts from the discretized euclidean path integral for pure gravity, with the squared

edge lengths taken as fundamental variables,

zl = z

the above expression represents a lattice discretization of the continuum euclidean path integral for pure

(4.27)

with k1 = 8g, and g newtons constant, and reduces to it for smooth enough eld congurations. in

the discrete case the integration over metrics is replaced by integrals over the elementary lattice degrees

of freedom, the squared edge lengths. the discrete gravitational measure in zl can be considered as the

lattice analog of the dewitt [35] continuum functional measure [15]. the a term in the lattice action is

the well-known regge term [5], and reduces to the einstein-hilbert action in the lattice continuum limit

[6, 29]. a cosmological constant term is needed for convergence of the path integral, while the curvature

squared term allows one to control the uctuations in the curvature [7, 9, 11, 12]. in practice, and for obvious

phenomenological reasons, one is only interested in the limit when the higher derivative contributions are

small compared to the rest, a  0. in this limit the theory depends, in the absence of matter and after a
suitable rescaling of the metric, only on one bare parameter, the dimensionless coupling k2/. without loss

of generality, one can therefore set the bare cosmological constant  = 1.

some partial information about the behavior of physical correlations can be obtained indirectly from

local invariant averages. in [7, 12] gravitational observables such as the average curvature and its uctuation

10

were introduced. the appropriate lattice analogs of these quantities are readily written down by making use

of the usual correspondences r d4xg  phinges h vh etc.. on the lattice the natural choices for invariant

operators are

vh

g (x)  xhinges hx
g r(x)  2 xhinges hx
g rr(x)  4 xhinges hx

hah

(hah)2/vh

(4.28)

(we have omitted here on the r.h.s. an overall numeric coecient, which will depend on how many hinges

are actually included in the summation; if the sum extends over all hinges within a single hypercube, then

there will be a total of 50 hinge contributions). in this paper no higher derivative terms will be considered,

and thus only the rst and second operators will be used in the following discussion.

on the lattice one prefers to dene quantities in such a way that variations in the average lattice spacing
< l2 > are compensated by the appropriate factor as determined from dimensional considerations. in the

case of the average curvature one denes the lattice quantity r as
< 2 ph hah >
<ph vh >
<r d4xg r(x) >
<r d4xg >

which in the continuum corresponds to

r(k)  < l2 >

and similarly for the curvature uctuation,

r(k) 

,

,

r(k) 

which in the continuum corresponds to

< (ph hah)2)2 >  <ph hah >2

<ph vh >

,

r(k) 

< (r g r)2 >  <r g r >2

<r g >

.

the latter is related to the connected curvature correlation at zero momentum

both r and r are related to derivatives of zl with respect to k,

(4.35)

one can contrast the behavior of the preceding quantities, associated strictly with the curvature, with the

analogous quantities involving the local volumes (and which correspond to the square root of the determinant

of the metric in the continuum). consider the average volume per site

(4.37)

and its uctuation dened as

v (k) 

expression

v (k)

the latter is related to the connected volume correlator at zero momentum

(4.40)

(4.41)

one would expect the uctuations in the curvature to be sensitive to the presence of a spin two massless

particle, while uctuations in the volume would only probe the correlations in the conformal mode channel.

5 sum rules

in this section some useful sum rules will be derived, which follow from simple scaling properties of the

discrete functional integral. these will be later used in the discussion of the numerical results. a simple

scaling argument, based on neglecting the eects of curvature terms entirely (which vanish in the vicinity of

the critical point), gives rst of all an estimate of the average volume per edge

in four dimensions the numerical simulations with  = 0 agree quite well with the above formula.

12

additional exact lattice identities can be obtained by examining the scaling properties of the action and

measure. the bare couplings k and  in the gravitational action are dimensionful in four dimensions, but

one can dene the dimensionless ratio k2/, and rescale the edge lengths so as to eliminate the overall length

scale pk/. as a consequence the path integral for pure gravity,

zl(, k, a) = z d[l2] ei[l2],

obeys the simple scaling property

where n1 represents the number of edges in the lattice, and the dl2 measure ( = 0) has been selected [15],

which is the lattice analog of the continuum dewitt functional measure. this equation implies in turn a

sum rule for local averages, which (again for the specic case of the dl2 measure) reads

2 <xh

vh >  k <xh

hah >  n1 = 0 ,

(5.45)

and is easily derived from eq. (5.44) and the denitions in eqs. (4.34) and (4.40). n0 represents the number

of sites in the lattice, and the averages are dened per site (for the hypercubic lattice used in this paper,

n1 = 15n0, n2 = 50n0, n3 = 36n0 and n4 = 24n0). the coecients on the l.h.s. of the equation reect

the scaling dimensions of the various terms, with the last term on the l.h.s. term arising from the scaling

property of the functional measure. this last formula is very useful in checking the accuracy of numerical

calculations and the convergence properties of the monte carlo sampling, and is usually satised to high
accuracy o(104). it is easy to see that a similar sum rule holds for the uctuations,

further sum rules can be derived by considering even higher derivatives of ln zl with respect of  and k.

the last equation relates the uctuation in the curvature to uctuations in the volumes, and thus implies

a relationship between their singular parts as well. in particular, a divergence in the curvature uctuation

implies a divergence of the same nature in the volume uctuation. in light of the previous discussion, from

now on we shall consider without loss of generality only the case of bare coupling  = 1. as a consequence,

all lengths will be tacitly expressed in units of the fundamental microscopic length scale 1/4.

is a uctuating quantity dependent on the choice of background metric. in addition, the lorentz group used

to classify spin states is meaningful only as a local concept. since the simplicial formulation is completely

coordinate independent, the introduction of the local lorentz group requires the denition of a tetrad within

each simplex, and the notion of a spin connection to describe the parallel transport of tensors between at

simplices. some of these aspects have recently been discussed from a continuum point of view in [37, 38, 39].

the correlation length  is dened through the long-distance decay of the connected, invariant correlations

at xed geodesic distance d. for the curvature correlation one has, at large distances,

at shorter distances one expects a slower, power law decay

with a power characterized by the exponent n. in both cases, the distances considered are much larger than

the lattice spacing, d,   l0. from scaling considerations one can show (see below) n = 4  1/.

simple scaling arguments allow one to determine the scaling behavior of correlation functions from the

critical exponents which characterize the singular behavior of local averages in the vicinity of the critical

point. a divergence of the correlation length

signals the presence of a phase transition, and leads to the appearance of a singularity in the free energy

f (k). the presence of a phase transition usually inferred from non-analytic terms in invariant averages, such

as the average curvature. the curvature critical exponent  is introduced via

from such averages one can determine the value for , the correlation length exponent, an equivalent result,

relating the quantum expectation value of the curvature to the physical correlation length  , is

r() kkc

(6.58)

which is obtained from eqs. (6.54) and (6.55) using 6.57). matching of dimensionalities in these equations
is restored by supplying appropriate powers of the planck length lp = g.

it is then easy to relate the critical exponent  to the scaling behavior of correlations at large distances.

the curvature uctuation is related to the connected scalar curvature correlator at zero momentum

(6.59)

a divergence in the uctuation is then indicative of long range correlations, corresponding to the presence

of a massless particle. very close to the critical point one would expect for large separations a power law

decay in the geodesic distance,

< gr(x)gr(y) >

(6.60)

with the power n related to the exponent  via n = d/(1 + ) = d  1/. a priori one cannot exclude to
possibility that some states acquire a mass away from the critical point, in which case one would expect the

following behavior for the correlation functions,

< gr(x)gr(y) > |xy|

exp(|x  y|/)

,

(6.61)

where  is the fundamental correlation length, and m = 1/ the associated mass. the above equation can

in fact be considered as a denition for what is meant by the correlation length .

7 beta function and continuum limit

the long distance behavior of quantum eld theories is determined by scaling behavior of the coupling

constant under a change in the momentum scale. asymptotically free theories such as qcd lead to vanishing

gauge couplings at short distances, while the opposite is true for qed. in general the xed point(s) of the

renormalization group need not be at zero coupling, but can be located at some nite gc, leading to a

non-trivial xed point or limit cycle [3, 4, 40].

in the 2 +  perturbative expansion for gravity [41] one analytically continues in the spacetime dimension

by using dimensional regularization, and applies perturbation theory about d = 2, where newtons constant

is dimensionless. a similar method is quite successful in determining the critical properties of the o(n)-

symmetric non-linear sigma model above two dimensions [42].

in this expansion the dimensionful bare

coupling is written as g0 = 2dg, where  is an ultraviolet cuto (corresponding on the lattice to a

momentum cuto of the order of the inverse average lattice spacing,   1/l0). there seem to be some
technical diculties with this expansion due to the presence of kinematic singularities for the graviton

propagator in two dimension (the einstein action is a topological invariant in d = 2), but which seem to

have been overcome recently. a double expansion in g and  = d2 then leads in lowest order to a nontrivial
xed point in g above two dimensions

(g) 

g

 log 

= (d  2) g  0 g2 + 

,

(7.62)

with 0 > 0 for pure gravity. to lowest order the ultraviolet xed point is then at gc = 1/0(d  2).
integrating eq. (7.62) close to the non-trivial xed point one obtains for g > gc

m =  exp z g dg

(g)! ggc

 | g  gc|1/ (gc)

,

(7.63)

where m is an arbitrary integration constant, with the dimensions of a mass, and which should be associated

with some physical scale. it would appear natural here to identify it with the inverse of the gravitational

correlation length ( = m1), or some scale associated with the average curvature. the derivative of the

beta function at the xed point denes the critical exponent , which to this order is independent of 0,
(gc) = (d  2) = 1/.

the previous results illustrate how the lattice continuum limit should be taken. it corresponds to   ,
g  gc with m held constant; for xed lattice cuto the continuum limit is approached by tuning g to gc.
in four dimensions the exponent  is dened by

m ggc

c  | g  gc| ,

16

(7.64)

where m is proportional to the graviton mass, and c is a calculable numerical coecient. the value of

 determines the running of the eective coupling g(), where  is an arbitrary momentum scale. the

renormalization group tells us that in general the eective coupling will grow or decrease with length scale

r = 1/, depending on whether g > gc or g < gc, respectively. the physical mass parameter m is itself

scale independent, and obeys the callan-symanzik renormalization group equation






m = 


 { c | g()  gc| } = 0

.

(7.65)

as a consequence, for g > gc, corresponding to the smooth phase, one expects for the running, eective

gravitational coupling [12, 15]

g(r) = g(0)h 1 + c (r/)1/ + o((r/)2/ )i ,

(7.66)

with c a calculable numerical constant. the physical mass m = 1 determines the magnitude of scaling

corrections, and plays a role similar to ms in qcd. it cannot be determined perturbatively as it appears

as an integration constant. physically it separates the short distance, ultraviolet regime with characteristic

momentum scale ,

from the large distance, infrared region

l1
0    m ,

m    l1 ,

(7.67)

(7.68)

where l =< v >1/4 is the linear size of the system.

the exponent  is simply related to the derivative of the beta function for g in the vicinity of the

ultraviolet xed point,

(gc) = 1/ .

(7.69)

thus computing  is equivalent to computing the derivative of the beta function in the vicinity of the

ultraviolet xed point. there are indications from the lattice theory that only the smooth phase with

g > gc exists (in the sense that spacetime collapses onto itself for g < gc), which would suggest that the

gravitational coupling can only increase with distance.

one should also perhaps recall here the fact that a bare cosmological constant , which could appear in

the original action (as indicated in eq. (4.26)) has been scaled out, when it was set equal to one by rescaling

all the edge lengths. if one puts it back in, then the eective newtons constant would have to be multiplied

by that bare scale. as a result one obtains for the running of newtons constant, valid for short distances

where gc is a pure number of order one, and below it will be argued that 1/ = 3. the quantity l0 is the

average lattice spacing, and the correct dimensions for g() (length squared) have been restored. in addition

a bare cosmological constant  was re-introduced, which was previously set equal to one in eq. (4.26) (it

xes the overall length scale in the functional integral over edge lengths).

8 numerical results

next we come to a discussion of the numerical methods employed in this work and the analysis of the

results. as in previous work, the edge lengths are updated by a straightforward monte carlo algorithm,

generating eventually an ensemble of congurations distributed according to the action and measure of

eq. (4.26). further details of the method as applied to pure gravity are discussed in [7, 12], and will not be

repeated here.

in this work lattices of size 4  4  4  4 (with 256 sites, 3840 edges, 6144 simplices) 8  8  8  8 (with
4096 sites, 6144 edges, 98304 simplices) 16 16 16 16 (with 65536 sites, 983040 edges, 1572864 simplices)
were considered. even though these lattices are not very large, one should keep in mind that due to the

simplicial nature of the lattice there are many edges per hypercube with many interaction terms, and as

a consequence the statistical uctuations can be comparatively small, unless measurements are taken very

close to a critical point, and at rather large separation in the case of the potential. the results presented

here are still preliminary, and in the future it should be possible to repeat such calculations with improved

accuracy on much larger lattices.

the topology is restricted to a four-torus (periodic boundary conditions). we have argued before that

one could perform similar calculations with lattices employing dierent boundary conditions or topology,

but the universal infrared scaling properties of the theory should be determined only by short-distance

renormalization eects.

it seems reasonable that based on physical considerations one needs to impose the constraint that the

scale of the curvature be much smaller than the average lattice spacing, but still much larger than the overall

size of the system. in other words

< l2 >  < l2 > |r|1  < v >1/2

.

(8.71)

or, that in momentum space the physical scales should be much smaller that the ultraviolet cuto, but much

larger than the infrared cuto. an equivalent requirement is then

l1

< m < l1

0

,

18

(8.72)

where l is the linear size of the system, m = 1/, and l0 the lattice spacing. it should be kept in mind

that in this model, and contrary to ordinary gauge theories on a lattice, the lattice spacing is a dynamical

quantity. even close to the critical point where the curvature vanishes the lattice is by no means regular,
and the quantity l0 = < l2 > only represents an average cuto parameter.

the bare cosmological constant  appearing in the gravitational action of eq. (4.26) was xed at 1 (since

this coupling sets the overall length scale in the problem), and the higher derivative coupling a was set to 0

(pure regge-einstein action). for the measure in eq. (4.26) this choice of parameters leads to a well behaved

ground state for k < kc  0.053 for a = 0 [12, 11]. the system then resides in the smooth phase, with
a fractal dimension close to four; on the other hand for k > kc the curvature becomes very large (rough

phase), and the lattice tends to collapse into degenerate congurations with very long, elongated simplices

[7, 9, 11, 12]. for a = 0 we investigated 22 values of k.

on the 164 lattice 36,000 consecutive congurations were generated for each value of k, and 22 dierent

values for k were chosen. the results for dierent values of k can be considered as completely statistically

uncorrelated, since they originated from unrelated congurations. on the smaller 84 lattice 100,000 consec-

utive congurations were generated for each value of k. on the 44 lattice 500,000 consecutive congurations

were generated for each value of k. to accumulate the results, the machine ran continuously for about 14

months.

the results obtained for the average curvature r (dened in eq. 4.29) as a function of the bare coupling
k are shown in fig. 1., on lattices of increasing size with 44, 84 and 164 sites. fig. 2. shows the 164 data by

itself. the errors in are quite small, of the order of a tenth of a percent or less, and are therefore not visible

in the graph.

in [12] it was found that as k is varied, the curvature is negative for suciently small k (smooth phase),

and appears to go to zero continuously at some nite value kc. for k  kc the curvature becomes very
large, and the simplices tend to collapse into degenerate congurations with very small volumes (< v > / <
l2 >2 0). this rough or collapsed phase is the region of the usual weak eld expansion (g  0); in the
continuum it is characterized by the unbounded uctuations in the conformal mode. but there appears to

be more structure to the data.

accurate and reproducible curvature data can only be obtained for k below the instability point ku since,

as already pointed out in [12], for k > ku  0.053 an instability develops, presumably associated with the
its signature is typical of a sharp rst order transition, beyond which the
unbounded conformal mode.

system tunnels into the rough, elongated phase which is two-dimensional in nature and has no physically

acceptable continuum limit. the instability is caused by the appearance of one or more localized singular

conguration, with a spike-like curvature singularity. it is not associated with any sort of coherent eect or

19

the appearance of long-range order, and remains localized around a few lattice points. in other words, the

correlation length  remains nite at ku. at strong coupling such singular congurations are suppressed by a

lack of phase space due to the functional measure, which imposes non-trivial constraints due to the triangle

inequalities and their higher dimensional analogs. in other language, the measure regulates the conformal

instability at suciently strong coupling.

it is characteristic of rst order transitions that the free energy develops only a delta-function singularity

at ku, with the metastable branch developing no non-analytic contribution at ku. indeed it is well known

from the theory of rst order transitions that tunneling eects will lead to a purely imaginary contribution

to the free energy, with an essential singularity for k > ku [26]. in the following we shall clearly distinguish

the instability point ku from the true critical point kc.

as a consequence, the non-analytic behavior of the free energy (and its derivatives which include for

example the average curvature) has to be obtained by analytic continuation of the euclidean theory into

the metastable branch. this procedure, while unusual, is formally equivalent to the construction of the

continuum theory exclusively from its strong coupling (small k, large g) expansion

given a large enough number of terms in this expansion, the nonanalytic behavior in the vicinity of the

true critical point at kc can then be determined using dierential or pade approximants [43], for appropriate

combinations of thermodynamic functions which are expected to be meromorphic in the vicinity of the true

critical point [44]. in the present case, instead of the analytic strong coupling expansion, one has at ones

disposal a set of (in principle, arbitrarily) accurate data points to which the expected functional form can

equally be tted. and what is assumed is the kind of regularity which is always assumed in extrapolating

nite series (whether convergent or asymptotic as in the case of qed or 4 in d < 4 [45]) to the boundary

of their radius of convergence.

ultimately it should be kept in mind that one is really only interested in the pseudo-riemannian case,

and not the euclidean one for which an instability due to the conformal mode is to be expected. indeed

had such an instability not occurred one might wonder if the resulting theory still had any relationship to

the original continuum theory. arguments based on eective actions suggest that if the euclidean (or more

appropriately, riemannian) lattice theory eventually approaches the classical continuum theory at large

distances and in the vicinity of the critical point, then an instability in the quantum lattice theory must

develop, since the continuum classical theory is known to be unstable.

20

in the following only data for k  ku will be considered; in fact to add a margin of safety only k  0.051
will be considered throughout the rest of the paper. this choice will avoid the inclusion in the ts of any

data aected by the sharp turnover which appears, for large lattices, at k = ku  0.053.

to extract the critical exponent , one ts the computed values for the average curvature to the form

(see eq. 6.55)

r(k) kkc ar (kc  k)

.

(8.75)

it would seem unreasonable to expect that the computed values for r are accurately described by this
function even for small k. instead the data is tted to the above functional form for either k  0.02 or
k  0.03 and the dierence in the t parameters can be used as one more measure for the error. additionally,
one can include a subleading correction

r(k) kkc ar (cid:2) kc  k + b (kc  k)2 (cid:3)

,

and use the results to further constraint the errors on ar, kc and  = 4  1.

using this set of procedures one obtains on the lattice with 44 sites

kc = 0.0676(20)

 = 0.343(8)

and on the lattice with 84 sites one nds

kc = 0.0614(27)

 = 0.322(16)

while on the lattice with 164 sites one nds

kc = 0.0630(11)

 = 0.330(6)

.

(8.76)

(8.77)

(8.78)

(8.79)

these results suggest that  is very close to 1/3, and can be compared to the older low-accuracy estimate

on an 84 lattice obtained in [12] for a = 0,  = 0.33(3).

fig. 3. shows a graph of the average curvature r(k) raised to the third power. one would expect to
get a straight line close to the critical point if the exponent for r(k) is exactly 1/3. the numerical data
indeed supports this assumption, and in fact the linearity of the results close to kc is quite striking. the

computed data is quite close to a straight line over a wide range of k values, providing further support for

the assumption of an algebraic singularity for r(k) itself, with exponent close to 1/3. using this procedure
one nds on the 164-site lattice

kc = 0.0639(10)

.

(8.80)

since the critical exponents play such a central role in determining the existence and nature of the

continuum limit, it appears desirable to have an independent way of estimating them, which either does not

the dependence of averages on the physical size of the system, one can independently estimate the critical

exponents.

a further stringent test on the value for , which appears to be consistent, within errors, with 1/3.

that the correlation length  is growing as one approaches the critical point, leading to a more marked volume

where l = v 1/4 is the linear size of the system and m = 1 is the lightest mass in the theory. combining

and averaging the estimates from correlations [34], potential [12] and nite size corrections to the average
curvature one can in fact estimate the magnitude of this mass directly. one obtains m  0.81 (kc  k)1/3,
giving a correlation length of about two lattice spacings at k = 0.050.

the value of kc itself should depend on the size of the system. indeed such a dependence is found when

comparing kc (as obtained from the algebraic singularity ts discussed previously) on dierent lattice sizes.

dierent size lattices are substantially reduced (points labelled by circles in fig. 6.). due to the few values

of l it is not possible at this point to extract an estimate for  from this particular set of data. but since 

is close to 1/3, it makes sense to use this value in eq. (8.83) at least as a rst approximation.

small |k|), since the decit angles are bounded, and the edge lengths uctuate around some average value,

can think of the uctuations in the conformal mode as becoming bounded (again at least for suciently

small |k|) when a momentum cuto of order /< l2 > is dynamically generated.

the slope of each straight lines determines the critical exponent  = 4  1, and it seems clear from the

graph that the slope is noticeably smaller for a = 0, suggesting that the higher derivative terms mask the

true critical behavior up to very small kc  k (it was already noted in [12] that for a = 0 the assumption of
an algebraic singularity for the average curvature leads to a value for the curvature exponent which is much

smaller than the estimate for a > 0, namely   0.30(4)).

indeed it seems that one of the eects of the higher derivative terms is to push the region of instability

towards smaller and smaller values of kc  k, until it becomes numerically undetectable. but we would argue
that it is only close to this region that the correct continuum behavior is recovered. the situation is similar

to what happens in the weak eld expansion and perturbation theory: higher derivative terms do not cure

the instability problems in the physically relevant region of small momenta and large correlation lengths.

fig. 8. shows a plot of the curvature amplitude ar versus the higher derivative coupling a. the rapid

growth close to a = 0 is consistent with an expected catastrophic instability for a < 0 (wrong sign for higher

derivative terms).

fig. 9. critical exponent  computed from the average curvature, versus the higher derivative coupling a. note the
small errorbar on the recent value for  at a = 0. for a > 0 the higher derivative terms tend to mask the true critical
behavior, which requires kc  k  a1.

a compilation of previous estimates for , together with the new value at a = 0, is shown in fig. 9.

there seems to be a clear trend toward smaller values as a approaches zero, the einstein-regge limit. while

the einstein action contribution becomes the dominant one at large distances, this is no longer the case at

intermediate distances in the presence of the higher derivative terms. one concludes that for a > 0 the
higher derivative terms tend to mask the true critical behavior, which requires kc  k  a1.

fig. 10. shows a plot of the average volume per site < v >, in units of the average edge length < l2 >.
the curve is a t of the form a + b(kc  k)c, and suggests a rather sudden drop of the average volume in
the vicinity of the critical point. a non-analiticity in < v > at kc is in fact consistent with the sum rule of

eq. (5.45), which suggest that the singular behavior in the average curvature r(k) and the average volume
< v > (k) are simply related. typically, the sum rule of eq. (5.45) is satised to one part in 103 or better.

as can be seen from fig. 10, close to the transition at kc the average volume per site expressed in

units of the average lattice spacing, < v > / < l2 >2 shows only a weak singularity when the critical point

is approached from the smooth phase (k < kc), and tends to a nite value. on the other hand, in the

30

rough phase (k > kc) the volume per site seems to approach smaller and smaller values as the lengths of

the runs are extended. in fact it would seem that in the rough phase the volume per site can be made to

approach zero, at least for some simplices. one refers therefore alternatively to this phase as the collapsed

or polymer-like phase, since its eective dimension is two 3. furthermore the relaxation times in the rough

phase become exceedingly long, with the system getting stuck in some degenerate, spike-like congurations

without being able to get out of it again.

it seems dicult to see how the collapse of the simplices could be averted by choosing a dierent lattice

structure (for example a random lattice), since its properties seem to be unaected by changes in the

measure or the action, at least to the extent they have been investigated. indeed the collapsed, polymer-like

phase appears even in the simplest models based on a regular tessellation of the four-sphere [7, 8]. from a

continuum point of view, the existence of such a pathological phase is not unexpected, and is interpreted

as reection of the unbounded uctuations in the conformal mode expected for suciently large k. indeed

unbounded uctuations in the conformal mode in the continuum correspond to rapid uctuations in the

simplicial volumes, and this is precisely what is observed on the lattice for k > kc, namely a rapid variation

of simplicial volumes when going from one simplex to a neighboring one.

fig. 11. shows a plot of the average edge length < l2 >. the curve is a t of the form a + b(kc  k)c,

and suggests a rapid increase in this quantity towards the critical point at kc. indeed as the critical point

is approached the number of fairly small and fairly large edge lengths proliferate, leading to an increasingly

wide edge length distribution.

fig. 12. shows a plot of the average curvature uctuation r(k) dened in eq. (4.31). at the critical

point the curvature uctuation diverges, by denition. as in the case of the average curvature r(k) analyzed
previously, one can extract the critical exponent  and kc by tting the computed values for the curvature

uctuation to the form (see eq. (6.56))

r(k) kkc

ar (kc  k)(1)

.

(8.84)

as for the curvature itself, it would seem unreasonable to expect that the computed values for r are
accurately described by this function even for small k. instead the data is tted to the above functional form

for either k  0.02 or k  0.03 and the dierence in the t parameters can be used as one more measure for
the error. additionally, one can include a subleading correction

r(k) kkc ar(cid:2) kc  k + b(kc  k)2 (cid:3)(1)

,

(8.85)

3an elementary argument can be given to explain the fact that the collapsed phase for k > kc has an eective dimension of
two, as was found in [12]. the instability is driven by the euclidean einstein term in the action, and in particular its unbounded
conformal mode contribution. as the manifold during collapse reaches an eective dimension of two this term turns into a
topological invariant, unable to drive the instability further to a still lower dimension.

and use the results to further constraint the errors on ar , kc and  = 4  1.

the values for  and kc obtained in this fashion are consistent with the ones obtained from the average

curvature r(k), but with somewhat larger errors, since uctuations are more dicult to compute accurately
than local averages, and require much higher statistics. using these procedures one obtains on the lattice

with 164 sites

kc = 0.0636(30)

(8.86)

fig. 13. shows a graph of the inverse curvature uctuation r(k) on the 164-site lattice, raised to power

3/2. one would expect to get a straight line close to the critical point if the exponent for r(k) is exactly

2/3. the numerical data indeed supports this assumption. the computed data is consistent with linear
behavior for small k  0.02, providing further support for the assumption of an algebraic singularity for
r(k) itself, with exponent close to 2/3. using this procedure one nds on the 164-site lattice

the data shown in figs. 3. and 12. from the denition of the average curvature r and curvature uctuation

k [43, 44]. using this method on the 164 lattice one nds

kc = 0.0635(11)

.

(8.90)

it is encouraging that the above estimates are in good agreement with the values obtained previously using

the other methods.

fig. 15. shows a graph of the scaled curvature uctuation r(k)/l2/4 for dierent values of l = 4, 8, 16,

t  kc  k and xo = 1   = 2  4 then all points should lie on the same universal curve. from the general
eq. (2.19) one expects in this particular case

r(k, l) = l2/4 h r(cid:16)(kc  k) l1/(cid:17) + o(l)i

provides a further estimate on the value for , close to 1/3.

37

fig. 16. shows a plot of the curvature uctuation r versus the curvature r. if the curvature approaches
zero at the critical point where the curvature uctuation diverges, one would expect the curvature uctuation

to diverge at r = 0. one has

r(r) kkc

a |r|(1)/  a |r|(42)/(41)

.

(8.92)

an advantage of this particular combination is that it does not require the knowledge of kc in order to

estimate . using all points corresponding to k  0.02 one nds

 = 0.328(6)

.

the error on  can be estimated, for example, by using a more elaborate t of the type

r r0

a | r + br2 |(42)/(41)

.

for  = 1/3 the exponent becomes equal to 2, and one has the simple result

r r0

a |r|2

.

(8.93)

(8.94)

(8.95)

one concludes that the evidence supports a vanishing curvature at the critical point, where the curvature

uctuation r and the correlation length  diverge. this result is further supported by the consistency of

the values for kc obtained independently from r(k) and r(k) (figs. 2,3,4,12,13,14 and 15).

as an independent measure of the uctuation one can also investigate the behavior of the edge length

uctuation dened as

where  is a critical exponent. using an analysis similar to what is done for the curvature and curvature

uctuation, on the 164 lattice it is found to diverge at

kc = 0.0609(23)

(8.97)

in agreement within errors with the previous values quoted for kc. one would expect such a uctuation

to be related to the uctuations in the local volumes, and, by the sum rule of eq. (5.45) which relates the

uctuations in the volume to uctuations in the curvature, one would expect  = 1   = 2  4. the
numerical results for gamma have larger errors but give values between 0.46 and 0.85, certainly consistent

with a value of  = 2/3 for  = 1/3.

finally fig. 17. summarizes the known information about the phase diagram in the k-a plane. the

continuous line separates the smooth phase with small negative curvature from the rough, polymer-like

phase.

9 critical exponents and phenomenoloy

in this section some consequences of the results presented above will be discussed, with ultimately an

eye towards possible physical applications. naively one would expect simply on the basis of dimensional

arguments that the curvature scale gets determined by the correlation length

r r0

1/2 ,

(9.99)

but one cannot in general exclude the appearance of some non-trivial exponent.

in the previous section arguments have been given in support of the value  = 1/3 for pure gravity. from

eqs. (6.58) relating the average curvature to the correlation length one has

r() kkc

1
l2d+1/
p

,

d1/

(9.100)

4the value  = 1/3 does not correspond to any known eld theory or statistical mechanics model in four dimensions. for
dilute branched polymers it is known that  = 1/2 in three dimensions [46], and  = 1/4 at the upper critical dimension d = 8
[47], so one would expect a value close to 1/3 somewhere in between. i thank john cardy for a discussion on this point.

41

and the correct dimension for the average curvature r have been restored by supplying appropriate powers
of the ultraviolet cuto, the planck length lp = g. one notices that close to two dimensions the exponent
of  indeed approaches 2, since   1/(d  2), and the classical result is recovered.
for  = 1/3 in four dimensions 5 one then obtains the remarkably simple result

r() kkc

1

lp 

.

(9.101)

an equivalent form can be given in terms of the curvature scale h0, dened through r = 12h 2
has dimensions of a mass squared. one has close to the critical point

0 , and which

h 2

0 = ch p m ,

(9.102)

where p = 1/g is the planck mass, m = 1/ is the inverse gravitational correlation length, and ch  4.9
a numerical constant of order one; the value for c is extracted from the known numerical values for r and
m close to the critical point at kc.

one can raise the legitimate concern of how these results are changed by quantum uctuations of matter

elds. in the presence of matter elds coupled to gravity (scalars, fermions, vector bosons, spin-3/2 elds etc.)

one expects the value for  to change due to vacuum polarization loops containing these elds. a number of

arguments can be given though for why these eects should not be too dramatic, unless the number of light

matter elds is very large. first, in the case of a single light scalar eld the vacuum polarization eects are

so small that they are barely detectable in the numerical evaluations of the path integral [48]. furthermore

one notices that to leading order in the 2 +  expansion the exponent  only depends on the dimensionality

of space-time, irrespective of the number of matter elds and of their type [41]. finally one can compute for

example the eects of scalar matter elds on the one-loop beta function in the 2 +  expansion for gravity,

and nds 0 = (2/3)(25  nf ) where nf is the number of massless scalar elds [41]. thus unless nf is large,
the matter contribution is quite small even to next-to-leading order in the 2 +  expansion. the present

evidence would therefore suggest that the approximation in which vacuum polarization eects of light matter

elds are neglected should not be too unreasonable.

it seems natural to identify h0 with either some (negative) average spatial curvature, or possibly with

the hubble constant determining the macroscopic expansion rate of the present universe [12, 15]. in the

friedmann-robertson-walker model of standard cosmology [50] on has for the ricci scalar

5for all scalar eld theories (spin s = 0) in four dimensions it is known that  = 1/2, while for the compact abelian u(1)
gauge theory (s = 1) one has  = 2/5 [49]. the value  = 1/3 for pure gravitation (s = 2) in four dimensions is then consistent
with the simple formula  = 1/(2 + s/2).

today the hubble constant is given by h 2
t0, but it is eventually expected to show some slow
0  1028cm today is comparable to the present
extent of the visible universe. under such circumstances from eq. (9.102) one would expect the gravitational

variation in time, and its characteristic length scale ch 1

0 = ( r/r)2

correlation  to be signicantly larger than ch 1

0 . a potential problem arises though in trying to establish

a relationship between quantities which are truly constants (such as the ones appearing in eq. (9.102)), and

h0 which most likely depends on time. 6 in any case it is clear that some of these considerations are in fact

quite general, to the extent that they rely on general principles of the renormalization group and are not tied

to any particular value of , although  = 1/3 clearly has some aesthetic appeal. additional cosmological

and astrophysical arguments and proposed tests can be found in a recent paper [51].

one further observation can be made regarding the running of g. assuming the existence of an ultraviolet

xed point, the eective gravitational coupling is given by eq. (7.66) for short distances r  , but now
with an exponent  = 1/3,

with c a calculable numerical constant of order one. the appearance of  in this equation, which is a very

g(r) = g(0)(cid:2) 1 + c (r/)3 + o((r/)6)(cid:3) ,

(9.104)

large quantity by eq. (9.102), suggests that the leading scale-dependent correction, which gradually increases

the strength of the eective gravitational interaction as one goes to larger and larger length scales, should

be extremely small. 7

it is only for distances comparable to or larger than  that the gravitational potential should start to

weaken and fall o exponentially, with a range given by the gravitational correlation length ,

(9.105)

in many ways these results appear qualitatively consistent with the expected behavior of the tree-level

graviton propagator in anti-de sitter space [52, 53]. in the real world the range  must be of course very

large. from the fact that super-clusters of galaxies apparently do form, one can easily set an observational

lower limit  > 1025cm.

it is unclear to what extent gravitational correlations can be measured directly. from the denition of

the curvature correlation function in eq. (6.53) one has for short distances r   and for the specic value
 = 1/3 the remarkably simple result

< g r(x) g r(y) (|x  y|  d) >c d

6the only exception being the steady state cosmological models, where h is truly a constant of nature. these models are

not favored by present observations, including detailed features of the cosmic background radiation.

practically negligible.

with a a calculable numerical constant of order one. one can contrast this behavior with the semiclassical

result attained close to two dimensions (and which incidentally coincides with the lowest order weak eld

expansion result [38]), which gives instead for the power the value 2(d1/)  2(d(d2))  4, as expected
on the basis of naive dimensional arguments (r  2h).

if one considers the curvature r averaged over a spherical volume vr = 4r3/3,

one can compute the corresponding variance in the curvature

similar density correlations have been estimated from observational data by analyzing known galaxy number

10 concluding remarks

numerical simulation methods combined with modern renormalization group arguments and nite size

scaling can provide detailed information on non-perturbative aspects of a lattice model of quantum gravity.

it has been known for some time that the lattice model has two phases, only one of which is physically

acceptable. in this work we have described in some detail the properties of the latter smooth phase, and

provided quantitative estimates for the critical point, the scaling dimensions and the behavior of correlations

at distances large compared to the cuto. in spite of the fact that the euclidean theory becomes unstable

as one approaches the critical point at kc, it is still possible to determine by a straightforward analytic

continuation the physical properties of the model in the vicinity of the true xed point, dened as the point

where a non-analiticity develops in the strong coupling branch of zl(k), and where scaling implies that the

physical correlation  diverges.

if this prescription is followed, an estimate for the non-perturbative callan-symanzik beta function in

the vicinity of the xed point can be obtained, to leading order in the deviation of the bare coupling from its

critical value. the resulting scale evolution for the gravitational constant is then quantitatively quite small,

if one assumes that the scaling violation parameter is related to an average curvature and its characteristic

scale h0. its infrared growth, consistent with the general idea that gravitational vacuum polarization eects

cannot exert any screening, suggests that low energy properties of quantum gravity are inaccessible by

weak coupling perturbation theory: low energy quantum gravity is a strongly coupled theory. on a more

quantitative side, as pointed out in the discussion there are a number of attractive features to the pure

gravity result  = 1/3, including a simple form for the curvature correlations at short distances.

it seems legitimate to ask the question whether the present lattice model for quantum gravity provides

any insight into the problem of the cosmological constant. the answer is both yes and no. to the extent

that a naive prediction of quantum gravity is that the curvature scale should be of the same order of the

planck length, r  1/g, the answer is denitely yes. indeed it can be regarded as a non-trivial result of the
lattice models for gravity that a region in coupling constant space can be found where space-time is sti and

the curvature can be made much smaller than 1/g. in fact the evidence indicates that the average curvature

r vanishes at the critical point kc. and this is achieved with a bare cosmological constant  which is of
order one in units of the cuto. phrased dierently, the dimensionless ratio between the renormalized and

the bare cosmological constant becomes arbitrarily small towards the critical point.

at the same time the eective long distance cosmological constant is non-vanishing and of order 1/,

and the value zero is only obtained when  is exactly zero, which happens only at the critical point kc.

45

thus to make the eective cosmological constant small requires a ne tuning, in the sense that the bare

coupling kc k has to be small. but since the correlation length determines the corrections to the newtonian
potential (and in particular its eventual decrease for large enough distances), it would seem unnatural to have

a short correlation length : in such a world there would be no long-range gravitational forces, and separate

space-time domains would have decoupled uctuations. from this perspective, long range forces and a small

cosmological constant go hand in hand. quantum uctuation eects show that hyperbolic space-times with

small curvature radii cannot sustain long-range gravitational forces, at least in this model.
