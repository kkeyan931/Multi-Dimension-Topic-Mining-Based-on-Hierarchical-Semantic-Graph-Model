(2.9) non-commutative counterpart, right-hand side (1.8), l( f ) = tr(g1 f g1 f ) + o(2) = tr(g1f g1f ) + o(2). (2.10) thus (1.8) satised (2.8). may seem trivial important: f 2 term (2.8) qualied initial term consistent lagrangian expansion. let us dene initial term condition follows: f (f ) satises f (b + f ) = f (f ) + total derivative, (2.11) say f (f ) satises initial term condition. terminology, tr(g1f g1f ) satises initial term condition. go order o(2). non-commutative side tr(g1 f g1 f ) evaluated follows: tr(g1 f g1 f ) = tr(g1 f g1 f ) + o(4) = tr(g1 f )2 + 2(2)2tr(g1b)2(g1f )2 + o(4) = tr(g1f )2 +2(2)2trg1b(g1f )3 +2(2)2tr(g1b)2(g1f )2 + total derivative + o(4).

(2.15) comparison o(b2f 2) terms provides consistency condition. three missing terms (2.12) comparison (2.15). two combined total derivative: (2)2(cid:20)tr(g1bg1f )2 1 2 (tr(g1bg1f ))2(cid:21) = total derivative. last one 1 4 (2)2tr(g1b)2tr(g1f )2 (2.16) (2.17) taken care b-dependence coupling constant. lagrangian l(f ) terms ordinary gauge theory multiplied det g/gs gs string coupling constant write corresponding factor non-commutative side det g/gs. new coupling constant gs depend b. b-dependence point view, gs determined  using dbi lagrangian. cannot use dbi lagrangian: determining form. determined perturbatively presence term (2.17) follows: det g gs det g gs = (cid:20)1 1 4 (2)2tr(g1b)2 + o(4)(cid:21) . (2.18) 6 completes consistency check o(b2f 2) terms. presence structure (2.15) turn requires existence corresponding structure non-commutative side, 1 2 (2)2tr(g1 f )4 arbitrary 1 8 (2)2(tr(g1 f )2)2 arbitrary, (2.19) subscripts arbitrary imply ordering four eld strengths term arbitrary. since product non-commutative gauge theory non-commutative product, specify ordering eld strengths case f 4 terms yang-mills theory. however, non-commutativity becomes relevant higher orders expansion: (2)2tr(g1 f )4 arbitrary 1 8 (2)2(tr(g1 f )2)2 arbitrary 1 2 = 1 2 (2)2tr(g1 f )4 1 8 (2)2(tr(g1 f )2)2 + o(4), (2.20) product second line ordinary one, ordering problem matter order discussing. inversely, consideration present order alone cannot constrain ordering. would interesting see discussion higher orders determine constrain ordering. summarize, seen lagrangian l(b + f ) = det g gs (cid:20)tr(g1(b + f ))2 + 1 2 (2)2tr(g1(b + f ))4 1 8 (2)2(tr(g1(b + f ))2)2 + o(4)(cid:21) , (2.21) non-commutative counterpart det g gs l( f ) = (cid:20)tr(g1 f g1 f ) + 1 2 (2)2tr(g1 f )4 arbitrary 1 8 (2)2(tr(g1 f )2)2 arbitrary + o(4)(cid:21) , (2.22) coincide total derivative denition gs (2.18), namely, condition (1.8) satised. thus uniquely determined f 4 terms det g l(f ) = gs 1 2 (2)2tr(g1f )4 (cid:20)tr(g1f )2 + (2)2(tr(g1f )2)2 + o(4)(cid:21) , 1 8 7 (2.23) requirement (1.8) alone. resulting lagrangian coincides expan- sion dbi lagrangian multiplied (2)2 4(2)p() p+1 2 (2.24) dimension space-time p + 1. would like make comment here. fact determined f 4 terms uniquely f 2 term follows impossible organize f 4 terms satisfy (1.8) without f 2 term. words, f 4 structure satisfy initial term condition dened (2.11). show explicitly writing general f 4 terms seeing satisfy (2.11). dicult see o(b2f 2) terms left-hand side cannot arranged total derivative. 3. determination two-derivative corrections since explained strategy detail section 2, would dicult apply two-derivative corrections dbi lagrangian. rst part section, construct one consistent lagrangians two derivatives quartic order eld strength. derive general form lagrangian order second part. 3.1 construction consistent lagrangian two-derivative corrections dbi lagrangian rst appear order o() compared f 2 term. using integration parts bianchi identity, term order o() transformed following form overall constant: l(f ) = (g1)nm(g1)ijnfjk(g1)klmfli.
