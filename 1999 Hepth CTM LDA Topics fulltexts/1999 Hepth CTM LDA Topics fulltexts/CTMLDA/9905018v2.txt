abstract

we nd novel bound states of ns5, d6 and d8-branes in massive
type iia string theory. as the ns gauge transformations can change
the chern class of the rr eld these congurations should be thought
of as nonlocal objects called gerbes. we develop a global formalism
for theories that involve massive tensor elds in general, and apply
it in massive type iia supergravity. we check the results by inves-
tigating the t-dual ns5/d5-brane congurations in type iib, and
relate them to an f-theory compactication on cy3. we comment on
the implications to consistency conditions for brane-wrapping and the
classication of d-brane charges in terms of k-theory classes.

1 introduction

gauge symmetry has certainly proved to be one of the most ecient tools in
quantum field theory and in string theory. physically gauge symmetry fa-
cilitates the study of complicated systems by enlarging the space where these
systems are embedded. in particular, they enable us to describe solitonic ob-
jects such as instantons, by making crucially use of the underlying symmetry.
conversely, recovering an unexpected symmetry enables one to reduce the
number of physical states. these physical ideas have their mathematical
counterparts in ber bundles. these are global constructions on manifolds
and manage, for example, to capture much information of the underlying
manifold.

it may happen that in a well dened theory there are two symmetries that
in some sense conict: such a situation arises for instance in any theory that
involves massive tensor elds, such as many world-volume eective theories
in string theory, or the massive type iia supergravity. there a gauge
symmetry of one eld seems to shift the characteristic class of another eld.
this situation clearly falls outside the usual mathematical formulation that
is built on globally dened bundles.

recently, there have appeared constructions which seem to be able to
accommodate this kind of situations [1, 2]. these structures have already
been applied in quantum field theory in [3, 4, 5]. these objects, gerbes,
are most conveniently described in terms of locally dened line bundles, as
opposed to the traditional global ber bundles we referred to above. they are
the next logical step in a sequence that starts with functions on a manifold,
and is followed by line bundles. the physical applications of these structures
for the study of which this paper is intended describe inherently nonlocal
physical objects and processes.

by employing the symmetries of the eective type iia supergravity theory
to the full one may construct brane-congurations as gerbes. as an example
we construct a bound state of ns5-branes and d6-branes in the presence of
a cosmological constant. gerbes cannot be seen as local objects in the same
sense as normal bundles or chanpaton bundles can. this fact claries some
of the diculties encountered in classifying type iia d-branes in terms of
their normal bundles.

in [6] it was suggested that d-brane charges could be described by k-
theory classes. the classication of almost all of the cases encountered in
string theory was performed in [7], and continued in [8, 9, 10]. the classi-

2

cation was based on the idea that supersymmetric d-branes could be built as
bound states of non-supersymmetric higher-dimensional d-branes [11]. the
stability of a these braneanti-brane constructions depends on the properties
of the branes normal and chanpaton bundles. on the other hand, vector
bundles on a manifold x are in general classied in k-theory. this leads to
a partial classication of d-brane charges in terms of the groups k(x), as
well. the classication was extended to comprise the so called twisted ber
bundles, which are essentially trivial gerbes.

having introduced gerbes as generalizations of ber bundles the next
logical step would be to extend this classication (in the case of type iia)
to something that should be the k-theory of gerbes. however, we shall argue
that string theory resolves this classication for us by simply relating the
problematic type iia solutions to more classiable ones in type iib. in any
case the answer seems to be the one suggested in [7] and conrmed in [8],
namely that the classication group should be k 1(x).

in all of these congurations the (integral) cohomology class of the ns
eld strength plays a central role. it appears as an obstruction to wrapping a
brane on a submanifold or, in certain cases, to classifying d-brane charges in
k-theory, and it is the characteristic class of a gerbe. these appearances are
intimately connected in gerbe structures. in this paper we attempt among
other things to clarify the role played by the ns eld strength both in string
theory and in supergravity theories.

a central concept in the present article will be the zero-form eld strength
in type iia string theory, the cosmological constant. we shall consider it
a section of a constant sheaf, thus allowing it to jump. this is necessary to
guarantee the stability of the full solution. a jump would mean that there
were present a d8-brane. for the most part of the paper the cosmological
constant will be a true, though nonzero, constant as turns out to be necessary
for the consistency of the gerbe.

in the same way that a line bundle has a natural characteristic class
related to, say in the case of the dirac monopole bundle, to the number
of monopoles, the characteristic class of the gerbe will in our constructions
describe the number of ns5-branes. the other ingredient will be the appear-
ance of d6-branes described in terms of line bundles that can be dened only
locally. nevertheless, we can nd a globally dened modied eld strength.
the topological stability of these constructions is encoded in the gerbe.

in order to gain further understanding of these novel systems we nd the
t-dual solutions on the type iib side. these turn out to include a non-trivial

3

axion, ns5/d5-brane dyons, d7-branes and orbifold singularities. stability
considerations in iia lead one to a consistent treatment of the decit angle
in type iib. the form-eld equations of motion can be solved explicitly, but
the metric and the dilaton must be extracted from an f-theory construction
on an elliptically bered cy3.

the article is organized as follows: we begin with a toy model that
involves massive tensor elds in general. we then give a brief account of what
a gerbe is. we present our ansatz in massive type iia and solve the form-
eld equations of motion, dualize the solutions, and relate the construction to
an f-theory solution. we then discuss the classication of in particular type
iia branes in k-theory and the consistency conditions for brane wrapping in
the last section.

2 global structures in eld theory

2.1 massive form elds

the construction that we shall make use of below are characteristic to any
theory, where tensor elds become massive. these theories include maxwell
proca theory, massive iia supergravity [12], and the eective world-volume
theories on branes [13, 14]. in order to extract the essential features of these
systems, it may be helpful to start by considering the toy model

s = zx

dc  dc + (mc + dl)  (mc + dl) + . . . .

(1)

here c is a (p + 1)-form eld over a space-time x, l is a p-form sometimes
called the stuckelberg eld, and m is a constant. the action is invariant
under the transformations

and

c  c + da
l  l  ma

c  c
l  l + da

4

(2)

(3)

in general these transformations remain symmetries of the theory, when
e.g. da is replaced by a closed form, say f . in this case, however, a (respec-
tively a) is dened only locally.

in order to see what physical states there are one has to x the gauge.
any conguration (c, l) lies on the gauge orbit of (c + dl, 0). the l-eld
is thus not physical, and can be gauged away. in this gauge c is obviously a
massive tensor eld, the mass being given by the parameter m.

one may ask what happens in the theory when one takes the limit m  0.
the two elds decouple, and the physics is described by a massless tensor
eld and a u(1) gauge theory. the physical hilbert spaces of the theory are
very dierent depending on the value of m.

2.2 transition functions

physical states are in general given by equivalence classes of elds modulo
symmetries. when we are building a theory on a topologically nontrivial
space we must rst cover the space (say, x) by a suitable collection of local
charts {u}. fields dened on dierent charts are related by symmetries of
the theory  this means simply that the actions of transition functions on
dierent elds are given essentially by gauge transformations. in this well
known way e.g. tensor elds become sections of (x, r).

a particular conguration is described so that one gives the (not yet gauge
xed) elds on each coordinate patch, and tells what gauge transformation
g has to be done on the intersection u u to interpolate between dierent
local descriptions. for instance, in the toy example above we can take c 
p+1(x, r) and set

c = g  c = c + da.

(4)

from this construction certain consistency conditions ensue. for example
the transition functions of a vector bundle must obey the cocycle condition

(g) = ggg = 1

(5)

on triple intersections of local charts. gluing the local theories together on a
given space is not always possible; obstructions to this are most conveniently
discussed in cech-cohomology, cf. section 3.1

let us apply this to the toy model of section 2.1: given an atlas u on
the space x we can dene a eld theory where elds on dierent patches are

5

related by the gauge transformations (2) and (3). the latter transformations
interpreted as transition functions suggest for p = 1 a line bundle l 
x, provided the global extension of the local form dl denes an integral
cohomology class. this class characterizes the topology of the line bundle.

the former gauge transformations have a similar action on c. these
transformations, however, have a peculiar action on the line bundle l; it
seems as if we could shift the characteristic class of the bundle l by a sym-
metry of the theory. this suggests to consider structures where there are
dierent line bundles on dierent coordinate patches. these structures are
most conveniently described in terms of gerbes.

3 gerbes

as was in the case of the ambiguities introduced by gauge symmetries,
even the ambiguity in dening the right line bundles for stuckelberg elds
can be turned into an asset.
in the same way that the former lead us to
work with ber bundles, the latter should lead us to consider gerbes. here
we shall follow the lecture notes of hitchin [2].

3.1

cech-cohomology

let f = z2 or u(1) and assign to each n-fold intersection of local charts a
map to f

fi1,,in : ui1     uin  f .

(6)

that is antisymmetric in its indices. then we can dene a coboundary oper-
ator by setting

(f )i1,,in+1 = exp

n+1

(1)k+1 log fi1,,k,,in+1

xk=1

(7)

for example, the transition functions of an orthogonal or a unitary vector
bundle dene such functions for n = 2, namely f = det(g).

the cohomology h (x, f) of this complex, namely the cocycles (i.e. func-
tions that satisfy f = 0) modulo coboundaries (i.e. exact functions f = h),
is called cech-cohomology. it characterizes the topology of the manifold and

6

not only the choice of cover, if the cover is ne enough [15]. the cech-
cohomologies and the de rham cohomologies over r are isomorphic.

there are at least two well-known examples: the rst stiefelwhitney
class w1  h 1(x, z2) which is constructed using transition functions of a tan-
gent bundle is an obstruction to orientability. the second stiefelwhitney
class w2 similarly over z2 is constructed using lifts of these transition func-
tions into the spin-cover. a nontrivial w2 obstructs spin-structure.

3.2 denitions

a space x together with a collection of maps g as in (6) for n = 3 is
called a gerbe [2] if

(g) = 1 .

(8)

this is an obvious analogue of the condition (5). in the same way that a
chern class characterizes a line bundle, a class in h 3(x, z) characterizes a
gerbe.

there is an equivalent but a somewhat more concrete denition of a gerbe

that makes use of local line bundles [2]. it postulates that there exist

1) a line bundle l on each intersection u  u.

2) an isomorphism l  l1


3) a trivialization  of

l  l  l

(9)

that satises () = 1.

the local trivialization of a gerbe on a two-fold intersection of local charts
l is a dierence of line bundles,

l = l  l1


.

(10)

this should be seen as an analogue of the observation that a dierence (quo-
tient) of two trivializations of a line bundle (i.e. nonzero sections) is an ordi-
nary function. in general it is possible to dene higher gerbes as dierences
of lower gerbes; here we shall only make use of the 1-gerbes dened above.

7

3.3 connection

similarly to the curvature two-form of a line bundle that can be used to
represent the rst chern class, there is a three-form that can represent the
characteristic class of a gerbe. the three-form is constructed using a locally
dened two-form gauge potential b  2(u). the forms must satisfy the
compatibility condition that the dierence on a two-fold intersection u  u

b  b = f

(11)

be a curvature of a local line bundle. the curvature of the gerbe is then simply
a global three-form [g] = db  h 3(x, r). similarly to the chern class of
a line bundle, also the curvature of a gerbe must have integral cohomology
so that the gerbe has well dened transition functions.

this is exactly the situation we encountered in the massive tensor theo-
ries: a local two-form that can shift the cohomology of a local line bundle by
a symmetry of the theory.

4 an ansatz in massive type iia

the (massive) type iia string theory provides a physical example of a sys-
tem, where the considerations of the previous section are realized. there the
mass parameter of romans type iia supergravity [12] arises as the vac-
uum expectation value of the dual of a top-form eld strength, cf. [16, 17].
furthermore, both of the equivalents of the elds c and l turn out to carry
charges associated to nonperturbative excitations in the full string theory,
namely ns5-branes and d6-branes. it is therefore necessary to understand
the spectrum in the m 6= 0 phase without going directly to the naive unitary
gauge l = 0.

below we shall make an ansatz, and show that it is consistent with all
bianchi identities and form-eld equations of motion of the theory. in section
6.2 we relate the t-dual of our ansatz to a system of vebrane dyons in f-
theory compactied on a cy3.

4.1 the modied eld strength

let c be the free sum of rr elds. the modied eld strengths of type ii
eld theories are [18]

r(c) = dc  g  c + meb

(12)

8

where b is the ns two-form, g = db, and m the mass parameter of the type
iia theory. the bianchi identities are

dr(c)  g  r(c) = 0 .

(13)

the equations of motion follow from romans action [12], which in our no-
tation is

s = z e2(  r + 4d  d 

1
2

g  g)



1

r(c)  r(c) +

2

d1(r[4]  r[4]  g)

(14)

the only non-trivial components of r[2k] being those for 2k = 0, 2, 4. dualiz-
ing in the path integral leads to the dual eld strengths r[102k] = ()k r[2k]
as in [19].

let acp be the chanpaton gauge potential supported on the brane
world-volumes. then the rr form symmetry acts on the various elds ac-
cording to [18]

rrc = d  g   + eb
rrb = 0
rracp = 0

the system possesses also a ns symmetry, namely

nsc = m eb
nsb = d

nsacp = 2

(15)

(16)
(17)

as explained above, when we build a twisted theory on a manifold it
does not matter what the exact values of c and b are. instead, the phys-
ical condition is that the modied eld strengths r(c) and g be globally
dened sections of (x). note that the rr symmetry is the ordinary form
symmetry in disguise. in addition we can, again, allow d  f to become
cohomologously nontrivial. then the ns symmetry, for m 6= 0, changes the
chern classes or intersection numbers of the rr elds.

9

4.2 topology and rr elds

we consider an ansatz that supports ns5-brane, d6-brane and possibly d8-
brane charges in massive type iia theory. the stability and supersymmetries
of these congurations have been discussed in dierent context for example
in [20, 21]. many non-supersymmetric solutions of the massive type iia
supergravity were constructed already in ref. [12]. supersymmetric solutions
include the d8-brane of [22] and [17]. other solutions were found in [19, 23].
in order to nd the relevant perturbative lagrangian we rst consider the
bianchi identities (13). it will turn out to be consistent to set c [3] = c [5] = 0.
from the duality equations it then follows that

dc [7] =   (dc [1] + mb)

dc [9]  g  c [7] = m .

(18)
(19)

from (18), (19) and the fact that we shall be able to choose a b-eld that
satises b  b = 0 it follows that it is sucient to consider the action

s0 = z e2(  r + 4d  d 
r[8]  r[8] +z c [7]   ,

g  g)

(20)

where  is the poincare dual of the d6-brane. also the anomalous couplings
should be included, but it turns out that the equations of motion remain the
same provided

tr(f  f  f ) = 0 ,

(21)

where f = dvcp.

consider2 a space-time locally of the form m 1,6  s3, and a given point
p  s3. we cover the sphere with two hemispheres u0 and u1, so that the
point p is outside u0. let h satisfy

h = [v ]  2p  h 3(s3, z) ,

(22)

where [v ] is the de rham class of the volume form i.e. generator of h 3(s3, z),
p is the poincare dual of the point p, q is a parameter, and  = {d, d} is

2our construction is an extended application of that in [2].

10

the hodgede rham laplacian3. on the coordinate patch u1 we can similarly
dene

h1 = [v ] .

(23)

for nding the three-forms h, h1 it was needed that the relevant cohomology
classes vanish on the right hand side.

we can now give our ansatz for the various form elds. the ns two-form

is locally dened

the eld strength

b = (cid:26) q dh

q dh1

on u0
on u1

g = db = q[v ]

(24)

(25)

is globally dened. this ansatz supports q ns5-branes that are cut out of
the origin in r4\{0}  r  s3.

for generality we consider the mass parameter in romans supergravity

as a locally constant r-sheaf

m = (cid:26) m0

m1

on u0
on u1

(26)

this may lead to d8-brane charge. before introducing the metric the d8-
brane is not exactly localized anywhere. on the intersection of charts u0  u1
the charge is the dierence in cosmological constants

q(d8) = zs 0

m = m1  m0

(27)

as we are interested in bound states that involve d6-branes the correct
electric rr-form is c [7], whereas c [1] should be regarded as its magnetic
dual. these are naturally both gauge dependent objects, and the eld that
we should match over the intersections is r[8]. it follows that the one and
the sevenform elds are dened only on the intersections of charts.
it is
convenient to consider the dierence

3the hodge star  and the operator d refer to operations on s 3 and to the metric

= m0b0  m1b1 .

(28)

f = (cid:16)dc [1](cid:17)1

(cid:16)dc [1](cid:17)0

normalized to r 1 = 2.

11

which amounts to putting e.g. (dc [1])0 = 0.

the two-fold intersection of charts u0  u1 is topologically a cylinder. we
shall nd it convenient to describe it as a line bundle  : c  s2. if we
can show that f is in integral cohomology we have constructed a gerbe, and
no further checks will then be needed for only two charts. we defer this
discussion to section 4.3.

the d6-brane charge can be calculated integrating over the charge density

on a disc d  u1

zd

df = zd

(m0  m1) q v  2m0q p

= (m0  m1) q vol(s2)  2m0q

(29)

(30)

the rst term here gives a continuous contribution which will become im-
portant for the type iib construction. the result indicates that there is
d6-brane charge smeared everywhere on the sphere. let us now investigate
the various eld strengths in detail.

considering m0 = m1 = m we only see the contribution coming from the
extracted point. the physical interpretation is that in that point a dirac
string emerges from the sphere s3  r4  this is just the d6-brane. as f is
closed outside p we can write for concreteness

f =

mq

2

d cos   d

(31)

where the local coordinates are (r, , ), and we are suciently close to p.
as the formula does not depend on r it descends naturally to a two-form on
the sphere s2. further away from p we must decide the bration of c.

in order to see what happens if m0 6= m1 we should modify the above
calculation by setting h = [v ], which is possible locally on u0. the total
ns eld strength is globally dened; physically this means that we can with
impunity put ns5-branes inside a d8-brane. we still dene f only on the
intersection; then considering a disc d  u1 we get

zd

df = (m0  m1) q vol(s2)

(32)

we can stretch the disc, and the cover, as to cover all of the sphere save a
point. the integral yields in this limit

zr3

df = 2 (m0  m1) q

(33)

12

thus there is a ux that corresponds to (m0  m1)q d6-branes at the ex-
cluded point on the other side of the sphere. it follows that passing a ns5-
brane through a d8-brane produces a d6-brane tube in between [21].

the ux f is not dened far a way from p, but it is purely a property
of the cylinder intersection of the two charts. the gauge invariant physical
quantity is r[8] = r[2]. on u0 we have r[2] = mb0. this actually extends
to the whole sphere as r[2] = mqdh. the electric eld strength is

r[8] =

mq

b

dh  vol(m 1,6),

(34)

where b is the conformal factor in front of the sphere metric in ten dimensions.
the function h satises

2h = 1  2(3)(p) .

(35)

it behaves near p as h(r) = 1/2r+o(1) and far away from it as h(r) = o(1).

the eld equation for the seven-form eld is

it follows

d  r[8] +  = 0 .

 = mq (v  2 p).

(36)

(37)

the d6-branes are supported in p and spread evenly over the sphere. the
ns two-form equation of motion reduces to ensuring that

e2 vol(m 1,6)
vol(s3)

(38)

does not depend on the coordinates of the sphere.

4.3 charge quantization

we want to interpret the non-gauge invariant two-form f as the curvature
of a suitable line bundle on the cylinder c : u0  u1  s2  r. if this can
be done the whole of the structure extends to a gerbe, as was explained in
section 3. the bundle we are looking for l01  s2 can be taken to have

13

the same base space s2 as the cylinder itself. the condition for l01 to be a
globally on s2 dened line bundle is that the curvature two-form be integral

(cid:20) f
2(cid:21)  h 2(s2, z)

(39)

notice that the factor vol(s2) in the formula for the ux (30) depends
continuously on the choice of d3. these observations lead to the quantization
conditions

m0 = m1
m0q  z .

(40)
(41)

the rst one implies that a d8-brane would separate gerbes from each other.
the cosmological constant m is quantized [18] because of the chernsimons
terms in the anomalous couplings. here this leads to a quantization of q as
well.

without the help of gerbes it would be dicult to see how the d6-brane
charge should be quantized, or conserved, as the eld strength f is not glob-
ally dened, and as its chern class can be changed by (small) ns gauge
transformations. now we have seen that quantization follows from imposing
the gerbe structure explained in section 3. conservation follows from the
fact that the ux arises from comparing two b-elds; even if the b-elds are
shifted by a nontrivial two-form in cohomology of the three sphere (minus
the point) the ux remains the same, provided m1 = m0. this is exactly the
condition that we stay inside a given gerbe.

the quantity that is conserved in the eld theory is r[2]. in our example

there are no electric sources for this eld d  r[2] = 0, but

dr[2] = m0q (v  2p)

(42)

this integrates to zero over the sphere. it means that the sphere is able to
absorb the ux emanating from p. from eld theory point of view this is a
consequence of the quadratic coupling between b and dc [1] that turns ux
into the b-eld [13, 14]. the closest parallel to this is the anomalous coupling
between the chanpaton eld strength and the rr potentials. there will
be a net ux out of the sphere only if it is placed on top of the d8-brane,
where two ux can ow.

the ux of g clearly emanates from the origin where there is a source.
except exactly at the d6-brane this ux turns into the charge density of r[2]

14

implying a monopole distribution spread evenly on the sphere. of course
once we embed the sphere in r4 the density falls o with the distance from
the ns5-branes. the physical sources in string theory are the d6-branes with
which one associates the locally dened beam of ux f through the point p.

5 t-duals in type iib

massive type iia solutions can be related to type iib solutions using a
scherkschwarz compactication, where the compact coordinate z  s1 has
period lb. applying t-duality on the d6-brane world-volume of the cong-
urations in sec. 4.2 and using the massive t-duality rules of [17, 24] yields4

c [0] =  + mz
c [2] =  c [0]q  dh + j [2] ,

where  is the vacuum expectation value and the current j [2] satises

dj [2] = 2 q c [0] p .

(43)
(44)

(45)

the exact forms of c [6] and c [8] depend on the (yet unknown) metric.

restricting to the branes i : m 1,5  x the pull-backs i[g] = 0 vanish,

and any spinc-manifold m 1,5 satises the consistency condition

i[h] = w + [d]

(46)

for a brane to wrap on it as it is stated in [25]. here h = hns, hrr,
[d] is the poincare dual of the (here absent) boundary of a three-brane
ending on the ns5/d5-brane, and w is some characteristic class constructed
naturally out of the topology of the brane. most notably it could be (w2),
where  : h 2(x, z2)  h 3(x, z) is the bockstein homomorphism  or the
characteristic class of the brane, if it happens to be a gerbe cf. sec. 7.

dualizing with respect to the coordinate that we previously took as the
distance from the ns5-branes we are obviously changing the topology from
r4\{0} to s1  s3. on the level of open strings this just amounts to turning
the d6-brane into a d5-brane on top of the ns5-brane.

if the bounding sphere s3 here is the same as the one in the iia picture we
obtain

(qd5, qns5) = (0, 2 q e2)

(50)

these are the ns5-branes we started from.

5.2 the knotted brane

let us show now that it is possible to choose the topology in such a way
that a non-zero ux could be captured by some other three-surface than
the previously used s3. we could choose this surface to be a circle bundle
 : m 3  s3  s2 with the same base manifold s2 we used for the cylinder
 : c  s2. the ber will be the isometry direction s1.

above, we got a generator of h 2(s2, z) by pushing forward d(h  h1)
by . this is the poincare dual of the ber of the cylinder bundle, and only
well dened in c.

let us now choose a section of the cylinder bundle i : s2  s3. the
form idh is again proportional to the generator of h 2(s2) and carries
information about the choice of bration. we can pull this form back to
m 3 using . assuming that h 1(m 3) = 0 any closed one-form is exact, and
idh = d(h + v) where v is an arbitrary closed vertical form.

there is indeed a eld that we can use for this purpose, namely v = dc [0].
these choices of the components of h,v carry information about how the
isometry direction s1  z is embedded in m 3. in particular, the d5-brane
charge turns out to be related to the linking number (hopf invariant)

5.3 topology of the ansatz

in type iia the congura-
let us recapitulate the construction thus far.
tion was described in terms of a gerbe. we were considering a system that
included ns5-branes, and locally dened d6-branes that ended in the ns5-
branes.
if there was a compact isometry direction in the world-volume of
the d6-brane we could t-dualize the system. we considered, for simplicity,
a dual system with parallel ns5-branes and d5-branes. it turned out, that
the d6-brane ux could get entangled with the isometry direction in such
a way as to produce d5-brane charge in addition to the previously found
ns5-brane charge. hopf invariants classify knots on s3 so that, in a sense,
we have tied the type iia d6-brane into a knot on the type iib side.

the obtained geometry, though maybe convoluted if described as above,
is not unfamiliar: we may combine the isometry circle and the ber of the
cylinder c into another cylinder c : the transverse space has then the struc-
ture of a cylinder bundle over a sphere, where the cylinder c  is the ber and
the sphere is the usual base space. in other words, the transverse space is an
elliptically over a sphere bered four-manifold with a singular ber. after all
the cylinder c  was only dened near the point p, so the whole construction
works locally.

furthermore, there is d7-brane charge, which implies a decit angle in
the iib metric. this charge is associated to a world-volume which is obtained

17

from the d6-brane m(d6) modding out by the isometry u(1), and adding
the sphere that has been serving us as a base manifold

m(d7) = (m(d6)  m 3)/u(1)

(56)

this follows from the fact that the loop that renders a nontrivial charge
goes around the nontrivial cycle of the the torus c . one may say that the
topologically interesting nonlocal features of the d6-brane translate under
massive t-duality into properties of the d7-brane (cf. sec. 6.1) rather than
to those of the dyonic ns5/d5-branes.

in section 6.2 we shall use global consistency conditions to patch these
local descriptions together and relate the geometry of the system to an f-
theory compactication.

6 generalizations

our construction can be naturally generalized for a nite set of extracted
points

p = {p|  i}  s3 ,

(57)

by just repeating the above procedure for each point separately. one then
obtains for each   i a pair of sets u 
0 = qdh 
and b
1 in an obvious generalization of section 4.2. we now have
to ensure that the arising line bundles on each two-fold intersection obey the
cocycle condition (5).

1 . let us dene b

1 = qdh 

0 and u 

the open neighborhoods of the points can be chosen so that they do not
intersect. we shall have to consider the following intersections of local charts

a) for intersections u 

1 u 

0 nothing new happens, and we get the bundles

l(p). the chern class was

 m(b

0  b

1 ) = 2 qm p = c1(cid:16)l(p)(cid:17)

(58)

b) on u 

0  u 

0 we call the bundle l. this intersection is again topolog-

ically a cylinder (three-sphere minus 2 points), and one nds

 m(b

0  b

0 ) = 2 qm (p  p)

(59)

18

the chern class is hence the dierence of the separate chern classes

c) the last cases to dene are the intersections u 

1 . now we get

c1(cid:16)l(cid:17) = c1(cid:16)l()(cid:17)  c1(cid:16)l()(cid:17)
0  u 
0 ) = 2 qm p = c1(cid:16)l(p)(cid:17)
1  u 

0 we observe

0  u 

 m(b

1  b

(60)

(61)

(62)

(63)

on the triple intersection u 

c1(l(p)) + c1(l) + c1(l(p)) = 0

which means that the product bundle

l(p)  l  l(p)

is indeed trivial. this proves our construction to be a gerbe.

notice that irrespective of the number of points the characteristic class is

[h] = q[v ]  h 3(x, z) .

(64)

notice also that base spaces of the line bundles cannot be described as em-
beddings/immersions into the space-time. they are entirely properties of
the two-fold intersections, and hence in a sense mutually non-local. the
gerbe manages to describe the topology of the space s3\p; in our case it is
merely a catalog of the various nontrivial two-cocycles in h 2(s3\p, z). this
geometric picture is similar to that in e.g. refs. [26, 27].

6.1 consistency and f-theory on cy3

in addition to verifying the equations of motion, which is a local statement
of the stability of the system, we should also consider global consistency. in
particular, due to the decit angle found above it is not consistent to consider
only one point p = {p}.

we should also take care that the system is at rest. the d6-branes
that pull the ns5-branes away from the origin should be arranged in such
a way that the net force cancels; this amounts to picking the points p
where the ux comes out of the sphere in a symmetric way. it follows that
discrete subgroups  of so(4) should act as permutations in p. the system
will therefore look as if the ns5-branes were put on the top of an orbifold
singularity in the origin  the gauge theory on its world-volume is therefore
the one described in [28, 29].

19

6.2 geometry of the ansatz

in section 5.3 we saw that the congurations that support the dyonic ve-
brane charges have an elliptically over a sphere bered transverse space, and
that there is d7-brane charge. above we found that a stable solution should
be invariant under . we have now to patch these local cylinder bundles
together in a way that guarantees the consistency of the global metric.

all of this is rather suggestive of an orbifold limit of a k3 compactication.
related congurations have been studied e.g. in [13, 30, 31]. a smooth
type iib compactication on a k3 is, however, not the right answer as
it would have twice as much supersymmetry as the original ns5/d6-brane
system in type iia. instead, we shall somehow have to take into account the
vebranes that have been put in the orbifold singularity in order to break the
supersymmetry properly to a quarter of the full type iib supersymmetry.

let us consider for a moment the type iib system without the vebranes.
the fact that our system involves an axion that depends nontrivially on the
coordinates of the elliptic ber was just a consequence of the scherkschwarz
reduction. on the other hand, any scherkschwarz compactication of type
iib on a circle can be formulated as an f-theory compactication on a torus
bundle over that circle [32]. in particular, an f-theory solution with the same
supersymmetry, a monodromy around the d7-branes/orientifolds that shifts
the axion, and the same weak coupling orbifold limit of a k3 singularity
was already obtained in [33, 34, 35]: the compactication there was an
elliptically5 over cp 1  cp 1 bered cy3 that reduced in ten dimensions in
weak coupling to type iib theory on k3  m 1,5/()fl     in the notation
of [35].

compactication on k3 and orientifolding by ()fl     both break
supersymmetry by a half, so that in the end we have exactly the right amount
of it. the fact that the third cohomology group of a k3 vanishes reects the
fact that we must put the vebrane dyons in the orbifold singularities of the
k3. also the third cohomology group of cp 1  cp 1 vanishes. we see that
the dyon charges should arise from topological winding numbers only on the
level of the full cy3 whose third cohomology is non-trivial.

we conclude that we have found at least a candidate for an f-theory
compactication that in type iib gives rise to the right rr charges and the
right ns5-brane charge. we interpret this as an f-theory argument for, even
if not a proof of, the consistency of the dilaton and the graviton equations of

5elliptically refers here to the torus of f-theory, not the cylinder c .

20

motion.6

locally in type iib the transverse space looks for  = zn like a taub
nut space.
in e.g. [36] the b eld was set proportional to the self-dual
harmonic two form of the taubnut space, the deformations of which con-
tributed to the number of zero modes that were needed in completing the
dyon spectrum. this provides an interpretation for the ubiquitous factor
vol(s2) that appeared in various charges. in our construction it character-
ized the choice of the base manifold s2  s3 using which we tie the sphere s3
together with the compact direction in the scherkschwarz compactication.

7 k-theory classication of branes

it has been suggested in [6, 7] and further elaborated in [8, 9, 10] that k-
theory on the world-volume of the brane classify d-brane charges. the map-
ping from the brane into the pertinent k-theory class [7] uses the normal
bundle of the embedded submanifold, which should have a spinc-structure.
a nontrivial w  h 3(z, z) obstructs such a structure, and it follows from
the consistency condition (46) that the the pull-back of the ns threeform
eld strengths vanish.

this situation was generalized to the class of congurations involving
a ns eld strength that is purely torsion in integral cohomology.
in this
case one was lead to consider the k-theory of twisted bundles [7]: these are
bundles whose transition functions do not necessarily satisfy (5), but instead

(g) = h

(65)

where  is the obstruction to spinc-structure and h is the lift of [g]
from h 3(x, z) to h 2(x, u(1)). these objects are trivial gerbes.

7.1 branes ending on branes

what does happen then, when the restriction of [g] does not vanish on the
brane? this leads one to consider branes ending on branes. the world-
volume theory will then contain couplings of the form c  dl of section 2.1
(cf. [13, 14]) and the present considerations are applicable.

6notice, however, that orientifolding imposes on the two-form potentials restrictions

that are not present on the type iia side.

21

the consistent treatment of the world-volume theory involves gerbes
along the lines of the construction in section 4.2, and the characteristic class
represented by the three-form eld strength [g] is, again, that of the gerbe
on the brane. this leads us too look upon the consistency condition (46) as
saying that the left hand side i[g] + w , which characterizes the intrinsic
topology of the brane whose world-volume theory we are looking at must
equal the right hand side [d], which are the sources. actually such classes as
the obstruction to spin-structure should already show up in the characteristic
class of a gerbe; consequently we should write

i[g] = [d]

(66)

this condition is then the direct generalization of the formula of electrody-
namics that states that the chern class of maxwell bundle equals the poincare
dual of the dirac string

[f ] = [2string] .

(67)

we conclude that the obstruction class for wrapping a brane on a cycle should
be the characteristic class of the gerbe on the cycle, i[g].

7.2 classication in type iia

the type iia theory presents a couple of problems in the direct application
of k-theory: the transverse space has odd dimension, and the analysis in
[7] for type iib has no obvious analogue. also, the branes to which the
cosmological constant m should naively couple are not submanifolds of space-
time  after all their world-volume should have dimension 1. nevertheless
string theory tells us [16] to treat the cosmological constant m = r[0] on
equal footing with any other rr eld strength. finally, on the level of
type iia supergravity the two-form ux is not gauge invariant and it is only
dened locally, as we have seen in the previous sections.

instead, the classication group of type iia d-brane charges has been
suggested in [7] to be k 1(x). in [8] this picture was realized by building
supersymmetric d-branes starting from nonsupersymmetric d9-branes.

the appearance of gerbe solutions calls for an extension of the classi-
cation to something that should be the k-theory of gerbes. however, as
the complications on the type iia side are connected with the appearance
of the mass parameter, a straightforward cure is simply to t-dualize the

22

congurations to type iib theory, where all eld strengths couple to geo-
metric objects. this is of course only possible in the case of congurations
that posses at least the one compact isometry direction needed to perform
t-duality.

the features that were in iia understood as consequences of having a cos-
mological constant then turn into characteristics of a scherkschwarz com-
pactication with respect to a coordinate whose period is related to the type
iia mass parameter. classication of type iia d-branes wrapping on a sub-
manifold z should be done in terms of the pertinent group on the type iib
side, namely k(z  s1), or some modication thereof, where s1 is the circle
with respect to which the duality transformation was performed. note that
the circle may lie also on the d-brane world-volume, in which case one might
be compelled to consider k(z/s1). as in [7] these considerations seem to
point towards the only other available independent k-theory group, namely
k 1(z).

8 summary

in this article we have investigated some applications of gerbes in string the-
ory and supergravity. we showed how these inherently nonlocal constructions
appear naturally in theories that involve massive tensor elds analogously to
how ber bundles appear whenever there is a gauge symmetry. we used this
new insight in analyzing the ns5/d6-brane systems that appear in (mas-
sive) type iia supergravity. this leads to new quantization conditions that
in particular relate the cosmological constant to the ns5-brane charge. the
d8-branes were interpreted as domain-walls between gerbes.

we then proceeded to nd the equivalent t-dual systems on the type
iib side. the dual branes were the ns5-brane and d5-brane dyons. because
the used massive t-duality involved a nontrivial scherkschwarz compacti-
cation the axion eld became nontrivial, and carried d7-brane charge related
to the iia cosmological constant. the system was identied as a f-theory
compactication on an elliptically brated cy3 manifold.

these considerations imply foremost that gerbes are a natural part of
the type iia string theory. the immediate reason for their appearance on
the type iia side was the zero-form rr eld strength, i.e. the cosmological
constant. the fact that the corresponding string theory objects would be
1-dimensional renders a direct k-theory classication of d-brane charges

23

dicult on the type iia side. a straightforward method to nd the classi-
cation groups for type iia is then to look at the t-dual objects on the iib
side.

we also considered wittens consistency conditions for brane wrapping
and found that they are closely related to gerbe structures.
indeed, the
integral cohomology class of the ns three-form should be interpreted as a
characteristic class of a gerbe.

we are now in position to use gerbe structures in type iia to study non-
local phenomena, such as mutually nonlocal branes on orbifold singularities
in type iib using gerbes. it would also be interesting to nd a more direct
relation to m-theory, and to see what implications these constructions have
on its spectrum.
