abstract

an inating brane-world can be created from nothing together with
its anti-de sitter (ads) bulk. the resulting space-time has compact spatial
sections bounded by the brane. during ination, the continuum of kk modes
is separated from the massless zero mode by the gap m = (3/2)h, where h
is the hubble rate. we consider the analog of the nariai solution and argue
that it describes pair production of black cigars attached to the inating
brane. in the case when the size of the instantons is much larger than the ads
radius, the 5-dimensional action agrees with the 4-dimensional one. hence,
the 5d and 4d gravitational entropies are the same in this limit. we also
consider thermal instantons with an ads black hole in the bulk. these may
be interpreted as describing the creation of a hot universe from nothing, or the
production of ads black holes in the vicinity of a pre-existing inating brane-
world. the lorentzian evolution of the brane-world after creation is briey
discussed. an additional integration constant in the friedmann equation
-accompanying a term which dilutes like radiation- describes the tidal force
in the fth direction and arises from the mass of a spherical object inside
the bulk. in general, this could be a 5-dimensional black hole or a parallel
brane-world of negative tension concentrical with our brane-world.
in the
case of thermal solutions, and in the spirit of the ads/cf t correspondence,
one may attribute the additional term to thermal radiation in the boundary
theory. then, for temperatures well below the ads scale, the entropy of this
radiation agrees with the entropy of the black hole in the ads bulk.

i. introduction

the idea that we may live on a brane propagating in a bulk spacetime of higher di-
mension is currently being considered in a variety of contexts, ranging from m-theory [1] to
phenomenological particle physics [2]. in particular, randall and sundrum (rs) have pro-
posed a simple and attractive scenario where our brane-world is embedded in a 5-dimensional
bulk with a negative cosmological constant 5 [3,4]. in this scenario, the extra dimension
need not be small. in fact it could be innite and yet we would perceive gravity as eectively
4-dimensional [46]. the reason is that the bulk is strongly curved, so that most of its physi-
cal volume is within a short distance   1/2
from the brane. the picture of a brane-world
evolving in a larger spacetime brings with it a new perspective for early universe cosmology.
in particular, it seems natural to investigate the question of brane-world creation.

5

the dynamics of the gravitational eld on the rs brane has been recently analyzed in
[5,6]. for the case of a single brane with positive tension, it has been shown that 4d einstein
gravity is recovered on the wall, with some corrections at short distances and at high matter
densities [5,6]. for the case of two parallel branes with opposite tension, there are additional
scalar interactions corresponding to the brane separation modulus. these give rise to brans-
dicke type theories on the branes with rather interesting behaviour [6] (the case where the
dilaton is stabilized has received some attention in [7]). a discussion of gravitational collapse
of matter on the brane was given in [8]. it was argued that the resulting black hole would
be a 5-dimensional object attached to the brane, with an event horizon in the shape of a
cigar. this conjecture was conrmed in the analogous 2+1 dimensional case [9].
in the
3+1 dimensional case, the conjecture is consistent with the form of the weak eld created by
spherical matter sources on the wall [6], although the non-perturbative black cigar solution
has not yet been found. finally, a great deal of attention has been devoted to cosmological
solutions [10,11]. in any discussion of gravity on the brane, the issue of boundary conditions
in the bulk is quite important.
if we are interested in the gravitational eld created by
matter sources on an asymptotically at brane, it seems reasonable to impose that the bulk
is asymptotically ads in the past cauchy horizon and at spacelike innity, and that there
is no incoming graviton ux from the past cauchy horizon [6]. in the cosmological context,
however, it seems much more appropriate to address the question of boundary conditions in
the framework of quantum cosmology.

in this paper, we shall consider the quantum creation of an inating brane-world and
its subsequent evolution. in section ii we shall present the de sitter-brane instanton. in
section iii we shall generalize it to nd the analog of the nariai solution. as we shall see,
this solution can be interpreted as describing pair creation of black cigars attached to the
inating brane. in section iv we shall consider thermal instantons which contain ads
black holes in the bulk. these may describe the creation of a hot universe from nothing, or
the production of ads black holes in the vicinity of a preexisting inating brane-world. our
conclusions are summarized in section v.

ii. de sitter-brane instanton

in 4-dimensional gravity, the simplest description of the birth of the universe involves the
de sitter instanton. this is a 4-sphere which interpolates between a point (or nothing) at
the south pole, and a 3-sphere of maximal radius at the equator. the 3-sphere represents the
geometry of the universe at the moment of creation. the subsequent cosmological evolution
is given by the analytic continuation of the 4-sphere to lorentzian signature, which gives an
inating spacetime.

this picture can be generalized to the case of a brane-world embedded in an ads bulk.

the line element of a 5-dimensional euclidean ads space can be written as

ds2

e = gabdxadxb = dr2 + 2 sinh2(r/)[d2 + sin2 d2

(3)].

(2.1)

here d2
(3) is the metric on the 3-sphere and  = (6/5)1/2 is the ads radius. a com-
pact brane-world instanton can be constructed by excising the spacetime region at r > r0
and gluing two copies of the remaining spacetime along the 4-sphere at r = r0. on that
hypersurface a brane of tension  is introduced so that israels matching conditions [5]

rg|r=r0 =

8g5

g|r=r0,

are satised. here g5 is the 5-dimensional gravitational constant and

 =

3

4g5

coth(r0/).

(2.2)

(2.3)

the greek indices run over the coordinates of the 4-sphere. the result of this cut and paste
procedure is illustrated in fig. 1. two copies of a spherical patch of ads bulk are bounded
by a common 4-sphere, which is the world-sheet of the brane. we may further identify both
copies of the bulk by imposing a z2 symmetry, although this identication will not play a
prominent role in our discussion.

the instanton in fig. 1 can be interpreted as a semiclassical path for the creation of a
universe from nothing. cutting the instanton in half, the euclidean solution interpolates
between nothing, at the south pole, and a spherical brane of radius

h 1   sinh(r0/)

at the equator. this is completely analogous to the usual 4-dimensional de sitter instanton,
except that in the present case the inside of the brane-world is lled with ads bulk.

the evolution of the brane after creation is given by the analytic continuation of (2.1) to
real time. this continuation is done by means of the substitution   iht + (/2), which
leads to

ds2 = dr2 + (h)2 sinh2(r/)[dt2 + h 2 cosh2(ht)d2

(3)].

(2.4)

the lorentzian spacetime is represented in fig. 2.

the brane at r = r0 is now an inating de sitter space with hubble rate h 1. the
line element (2.4) does not cover the whole spacetime, but only the exterior of the rindler

accross which we can match our solution to a new ads region or to a new de sitter-brane
region. but in any case, this extended solution is just a mathematical idealization, too
simple to represent the real world.

ination will only be useful if it comes to an end, giving rise to thermalized regions. for
that reason, we should consider the situation where the eective tension  is partly due to
the potential energy of an inaton eld :

a brane which has the critical tension c does not inate in the ads background (the
static randall-sundrum at brane-world [4] can be recovered from (2.4) in the limit r0  ,
which from (2.3) corresponds to  = c), so the eective cosmological constant vanishes for
v = 0.

the cosmological evolution of the closed universe after creation can be obtained as fol-
lows. due to spherical symmetry, the bulk inside a closed brane-world will be simply ads,
which is conveniently described in the static chart as

ds2 = a(r)dt 2 +

dr2
a(r)

+ r2d2

(3) ,

(2.7)

where a(r) = (1 + r2/2). the brane-world trajectory can be parametrized as r = r(t),
t = t (t). there is much freedom in this parametrization, and we shall choose the gauge in
which

r2 = a(r)2 t 2  a(r).
with this choice, the metric on the brane is given by

(2.8)

ds2

4 = dt2 + r2(t)d2
(3).

the equation of motion for the scale factor r can be obtained from israels matching con-
ditions under the assumption of z2 symmetry:

5

k = 4g5[t  (1/3)t g],

(2.9)

where t is the energy momentum tensor on the brane and k is the extrinsic curvature.
in terms of the normal vector na = ( r, t , 0, 0, 0), this is given by kab = (gc
b 
nbnd)nc;d. the angular components are given by

a  nanc)(gd

assuming that the energy momentum tensor has the perfect uid form

k = naa

 =  t [a(r)/r]g.

where c is given in (2.6) and dening

the angular components of (2.9) give

(2.11)

hence, the standard friedmann equation for cosmological evolution is recovered [22], with
a correction term which is negligible at moderately low energy densities 2x  1.
returning our attention to the inating de sitter solution, let us now check the existence
of the bound state of gravity on the brane and the nature of the spectrum of kaluza-klein
(kk) excitations. expanding the metric as ds2 = (gab + hab)dxadxb, we shall work in the
analog of the randall-sundrum (rs) gauge,

hrr = hr = h

 = h

| = 0,

(2.12)

where the vertical stroke indicates covariant derivative in the 4-dimensional de sitter space.
it is convenient to dene h = a1/2h, where a(r) =  sinh(r/), and a conformal radial
coordinate  through dr = a d. in terms of  we have

a() =



sinh(|| + 0)

,

( <  < +)

where 0 is dened by the equation sinh 0 = 1/ sinh(r0/). the equation of motion for
perturbations in the gauge (2.12) can be separated as [13]

(a3/2)

a3/2

h =

m2
h 2

h,

6

(2.13)

(2 + 2h 2 + m2)h = 0.

(2.14)

the schrodinger equation (2.13) determines the spectrum of masses m2, while (2.14) is the
equation of motion for spin two elds of mass m2 in a de sitter space of radius h 1. the
box indicates the 4-dimensional covariant dalembertian.

equation (2.13) has the obvious normalizable bound state h  a3/2, which corresponds
to the massless graviton. however, it is clear that the volcano potential in eq. (2.13)
approaches the constant 9/4 at   . hence, the continuous spectrum of kk excitations
starts at

m = (3/2)h.

this is a somewhat special value of the mass in de sitter space, corresponding to the critically
damped case. for smaller mass, long wavelenth perturbations are underdamped, whereas
for larger mass they have oscillatory behaviour. as is well known, de sitter space behaves
in some respects as a system with temperature t = h/2. the mass gap between the zero
mode and the kk modes may be related to the stability of de inating brane-world against
thermal excitation of the massive modes. this issue deserves further investigation.

solutions with two concentrical branes can easily be constructed by inserting a new brane

of negative tension

 =

4g5

coth(r1/) < 0

(2.15)

at some radius r1 < r0. the region r > r1 is excised, and the edges of the two copies
of the bulk are again identied along the 4-sphere at r1. in the absence of a mechanism
stabilizing the interbrane distance, the subsequent cosmological evolution on both branes
will be independent (although the evolution of cosmological perturbations will not be so, in
general). in particular, the branes will in general drift away or come closer together in the
course of evolution.

an important property of our scenario is that the problem of boundary conditions on the
past cauchy horizon does not exist. our brane-world is entirely contained in the causal future
of the compact hypersurface at which the whole universe appears in the lorentzian regime.
hence the evolution of the brane-world is uniquely determined by the initial data. one
can then unambiguously calculate the quantum uctuations around the classical solution.
one can either adopt hartle-hawkings no-boundary boundary condition [14], or vilenkins
tunneling boundary condition [15].
in the 4-dimensional theory, it is known that both
boundary conditions give the same uctuation spectrum [16]. in the present 5-dimensional
theory, detailed evaluation of the quantum uctuation spectrum is left for future study,
but the analysis of the kk modes given above indicates that only the massless (graviton)
mode contributes. hence the result would be similar to the case of standard 4-dimensional
quantum cosmological ination, irrespective of the hartle-hawking or vilenkin boundary
conditions.

iii. pair production of black cigars

as in the case of at brane-worlds, it is possible to nd nonlinear generalizations of the

zero mode on the brane. with the ansatz,

7

ds2 = gabdxadxb = dr2 + a2(r)dxdx,

(3.1)

where  is the 4-dimensional metric and a(r) =  sinh(r/), the 5-dimensional riemann
tensor is given by

r

rr = 2

 , r

 = ()r

 + cosh2(r/)(

  

 ).

(3.2)

it is then straightforward to show that the 5-dimensional equations of motion rab = 42gab
are satised provided that  is a solution of

()r = 3,

(3.3)

brane solutions can be constructed in the same manner as in the previous section, by excising
the region with r > r1 and introducing at the boundary a brane of tension given by (2.3).
the metric on the brane will be given by a2(r0). the argument is valid both for euclidean
and for lorentzian metrics. equation (3.3) can be interpreted as the 4-dimensional einstein
equations on the brane in the presence of a positive cosmological constant

4 =

3

a2(r0)  3h 2.

one solution of (3.3) is de sitter space, but any other solution can be chosen. as in the
previous section, we may optionally introduce a second brane of negative tension (2.15) at
some r1 < r0, excising the region with r < r1.

the euclidean action for the system of two branes of tension i located at ri and sepa-

rated by a region of ads bulk is given by

se =

ia4(ri)z d4x
where r is the ricci scalar. the energy momentum tensor is given by

16g5 z d5xg(25  r) +xi

where ab = 0 when a or b are equal to r. using the trace of the einstein equations, r can
be elliminated from (3.4), which gives

the eective tension of the brane is close to c and the matter density is much lower than
c), hi = [ sinh(ri/)]1, and v ()
is the (dimensionless) volume of the manifold with
metric . in the case of a single brane of positive tension, only the rst term in (3.6) is
present. also, in the limit where r0  r1, , we have se  s(0)
e , which in turn reduces to the
usual 4-dimensional action of the instanton with metric a2(r0) and cosmological constant
4 = 3h 2
0 .

4

it should be noted that the one-brane 5-dimensional solutions of the form (3.1) will in
general be singular. indeed, from (3.2), the non-vanishing components of the 5-dimensional
weyl tensor are given by c 

, and therefore

 = ()c 

c 2 =() c 2/a4(r).

unless ()c 2 = 0 (as is the case when the brane metric is conformally at) this invariant
diverges in the vicinity of r = 0. of course, this singularity will not occur in the case
with two branes. a similar divergence occurs in the randall-sundrum solution [4] when we
substitute the at 4-dimensional metric on the brane by any ricci at metric 

ds2 = dy2 + a2(y)dxdx,

(3.8)

where a(y) = e|y|/. in this case the divergence is at the ads horizon y  . an exception
occurs in the case when  is a 4-dimensional plane wave [17]. the reason is that plane
waves are null, and any invariant such as ()c 2 vanishes. in the cosmological case, ()c 2
does not vanish even for linearized gravity waves. this applies to the zero mode discussed
in the previous section, which is therefore singular on the rindler horizon. however, we do
not believe that this indicates any fundamental diculty. the expansion in modes is just
an instrument which is useful in order to nd the greens function of the wave equation.
for instance, in the case of at slices discussed by randall and sundrum, the kk modes are
singular on the ads horizon, and yet the gravitational eld created by isolated sources on the
brane (which is computed by using the green function of the wave operator) is non-singular
[6,18].

let us now consider the schwarzschild-de sitter solution on the brane:

h 2d2 = f (r)dt 2 +

dr2
f (r)

+ r2d2

(2).

(3.9)

here f (r) = (1  h 2r2  2m/r) and m is a free parameter. for hm  1, the equation
f (r) = 0 has three real solutions. one of them is negative and the other two are positive.
the two positive roots correspond to the black hole and cosmological horizons respectively.
for hm  1 the 5-dimensional solution is analogous to the black string described in [8].
at large distances from the brane sinh(r/)  (hm)1, the physical size of the horizon
a(r)hm is much smaller than the ads radius . in this region, the horizon of the black
string locally resembles a cylinder, which is entropically unstable to fragment into an array
of spherical horizons which in total have a larger surface area [19].

9

if the parameter m in (3.9) is increased, the black hole horizon on the brane increases
and the cosmological horizon decreases. the extremal case where both horizons have the
same size is the nariai solution, which has m = (33h)1 and r = (3h)1. the r, t
coordinates become inadequate in this case, since f tends to zero.
it is customary to
introduce a small parameter , dened by 27m 2h 2 = 1  32, and new coordinates (, )
through  = 3ht , 3hr = (1  cos  2/6). the black hole horizon is now at  = 0,
whereas the cosmological horizon is at  =  [20]. in the limit   0, one nds the nariai
solution:

d2 =

1
3

[ sin2  d2 + d2 + d2

(2)].

(3.10)

near this extremal case, the 5-dimensional solution is qualitatively dierent from the black
string. in fact, it appears to be much closer to the black cigar postulated in ref. [8]. the
potentially unstable regime a(r)hm   only arises for r  , where the scale factor
behaves linearly a  r. in this region, the horizon does not look like a cylinder at all. in
fact, the spatial section of the horizon closes o smoothly at r = 0, and looks like fig. 1,
except that now the vertical circles are 2-spheres rather than 4-spheres. therefore, the usual
argument that the horizon should be entropically unstable, breaking up into small spheres,
cannot be applied. some instability may still be expected near the tip of the cigar, at r = 0,
where c 2 diverges. we shall argue, however, that the singularity at r = 0 is rather mild,
and may in fact be smoothed out by quantum uctuations. note, in this connection, that
even for small zero mode perturbations near the de sitter-brane solution, the invariant c 2
diverges near r = 0. zero point uctuations corresponding to these modes, however, have
nite action and will inevitably occur. similar uctuations may be expected to smooth out
the tip of the black cigar in the nariai-brane solution.

as is well known, the 4-dimensional nariai instanton can be euclideanized by making
the substitution   i in (3.10). the corresponding euclidean solution is the product of
two 2-spheres s(2)  s(2), and in the limit when r0  , its action is given by (3.7) with
v ()
4 = (4/3)2 and ri = r0,

sn
e  

2

3gh 2

(3.11)

interestingly, this is the same as the action of the 4-dimensional nariai instanton with
the same curvature radius. for compact instantons, se coincides with the gravitational
entropy. hence, as long as the size of the instanton is large compared with the cut-o scale
, the entropy of the 5-dimensional solution coincides with the entropy of the brane-world
at the boundary. this is actually true for any choice of the brane-world geometry, and is
perhaps the consequence of a deeper holographic principle.

as mentioned above, the 5-dimensional instanton is singular at r = 0. however, by

introducing a boundary at some small r, the hawking-gibbons boundary term,

a4

8g5 z k 

 d4x =



3a3ra
16g5

v ()
4

vanishes as r  0 (here k is the extrinsic curvature). hence, this boundary does not
contribute to the action. since the singularity is so mild, we believe that the nariai-brane

10

instanton indeed represents a legitimate saddle point giving the main contribution to the
pair-creation rate of black cigars attached to the brane-world. this rate is obtained by
exponentiating the dierence between (3.11) and the action for the de sitter-brane solution,

sds
e  


gh 2 .

this gives the usual 4-dimensional result [20]   exp(/3gh 2).
in an alternative scenario, the singularity can be avoided by introducing a membrane
of negative tension, as mentioned at the beginning of this section. for suciently large
absolute value of the tension, the contribution of this second brane-world to the action will
be negligible and we recover (3.11).

finally, we may speculate about the existence of additional instantons describing the
pair creation of black holes during ination. one reason to suspect the existence of such
instantons is that the black cigar on a at brane has some corrections with respect to the
schwarzschild solution, whereas the instanton presented here has no such corrections with
respect to the nariai solution. however, it should be recalled that the mass of the black
holes considered here is not arbitrary: it is related to the curvature of de sitter and some
miraculous cancellation of the corrections may occur for this special value of the mass.
nevertheless we should leave the door open to the possible existence of completely non-
singular solutions. if these existed, they may have slightly lower action than the ones we
have considered here. however, even in this case we expect that their action would be very
similar in the low energy limit (since in this limit the action of our instanton agrees with
the four-dimensional nariai action).

iv. ads black holes and thermal instantons

in this section we shall consider instanton solutions where the black hole is not on the
brane, but in the bulk. we assume a scalar eld as the matter on the brane. since the
instanton is compact, we may interpret these congurations as describing the birth of a
brane-world which contains a bulk black hole. an alternative interpretation is that they
give the probability for pair creation of bulk black holes inside of a pre-existing inating
brane-world, analogous to the creation of black holes in the presence of a domain wall in
four dimensions [2124]. this interpretation parallels the one usually attributed to the 4d
nariai solution.

the most general form for the spherically symmetric euclidean space in the bulk is the

schwarzschild-ads solution, given by

ds2 = a(r)dt 2

(3).

a(r) = 1 +

where the parameter  is related to the mass of the ve dimensional black hole. a spherial
brane can be introduced, with trajectory given by r = r(te), t = t (te). two identical

11

copies of the bulk bounded by this trajectory are glued at the brane. choosing the parameter
te to be the cosmological proper time on the brane, the equations of motion reduce to the
euclidean version of eq. (2.11),

the eective tension of the brane is given by  = c + v (0). note that both the radius of

(4.5)

hence the temperature felt by observers on the brane is proportional to the inverse of the
black hole radius.

the euclidean action of the thermal instanton can be calculated along the same lines

discussed in section ii, and it is given by

se =

(4.6)

note that this expression also follows from the area law. from the ve-dimensional point of
view, the entropy of this system is due to the area of the ads black hole, which is equal to
42r3

+ (two copies of the black hole must be considered). since g5 = g, we have

sbh = se = area/4g5.

(4.7)

incidentally, the same argument can be applied to the de sitter and nariai instantons con-
sidered in the previous sections. there, the action is equal to minus one fourth of the total
area of cosmological and black hole horizons, in natural units.

for   , the black hole radius, r2

+  , is much larger than the ads radius. in
that case, the action of this instanton is much larger (smaller in absolute value) than the
action of the nariai-brane instanton with the same value of the eective brane tension (or
4-dimensional cosmological constant). hence, the nucleation rate of bulk black holes would
be very suppressed compared with the nucleation rate of black cigars on the brane.

on the other hand, if the thermal instanton is interpreted as describing creation of a hot
universe from nothing, it is of some interest to consider the evolution of this universe after
creation. this is described by the analytic continuation of (4.2),

where  is the density of matter on the brane. this is very similar to the usual friedmann
equation for the evolution of a 4-dimensional universe in einstein gravity. the only dier-
ences are the third and fourth terms in the right hand side of the equation. the third term
is the correction at large densities which we had already encountered in section ii. the last
term, which is due to the presence of the black hole in the bulk, behaves from the point of
view of four dimensions as an additional contribution to the matter density which dilutes
like radiation.

the possible presence of an additional term which dilutes like radiation was noted in
ref. [11] for the case of spatially at cosmology. there, the analog of  appeared as an
integration constant of the equations of motion on the brane. as shown above, this term
corresponds to the existence of a black hole in the bulk [22,25,26]. in fact, any spherically
symmetric massive object in the bulk (or even a massive parallel brane-world concentrical
with ours) would cause the same eect. this additional term does not arise in the case
of the maximally symmetric de sitter-brane instanton. in principle it would be present if
the universe was born via the thermal instanton. however, since the universe must inate
after creation, it seems that in the post-inationary epoch the most reasonable choice for
the integration constant is zero.

recently, there has been much interest in the so-called ads/cf t correspondence, a
possible duality relation between classical gravity in a ve dimensional ads bulk and a
conformal eld theory living on its boundary [27]. in this context, the last term in eq. (4.8)
may be interpreted from the boundary theory point of view, as the contribution of a true
radiation bath of the conformal elds whose energy density is r = (3/8g)(2/r4
0), whose
temperature is tb and whose volume is given by 22r3
0. the entropy of such radiation bath
is given by

v. conclusions

we have presented a quantum cosmological scenario of brane-world creation.

in this
scenario, not only an inating brane but also the associated 5-dimensional bulk spacetime are
created from nothing. the quantum creation is described by the de sitter-brane instanton
which consists of two identical patches of anti-de sitter space glued together by an s(4) brane.
the euclidean action of the instanton is generally dierent from that of the 4-dimensional
de sitter instanton but reduces to it if the de sitter radius is large compared with the ads
curvature radius. we have found that the gravitational kaluza-klein modes have a mass
gap in the spectrum and the continuous spectrum starts above the mass m = (3/2)h, where
h is the expansion rate during ination.

we have also found that there is a family of 5-dimensional solutions such that the metric
on the brane is any solution of the 4-dimensional vacuum einstein equations with a cosmo-
logical constant. unless the 4d metric is conformally at, these solutions are singular at the
center of the ads bulk. but the singularity is so weak that it does not aect the value of
the action at all (the singularity can also be avoided by placing a negative tension brane at
a small radius without altering the euclidean action much.) among these solutions is the
nariai-brane instanton which has the topology of s(2)  s(2) on the brane. we have argued
that this instanton describes pair-creation of black cigars threading through the brane.
we have studied thermal instantons which contain an ads black hole in the bulk. these
may either represent the creation of a hot universe from nothing or the pair creation of ads
black holes near an inating brane.
in the latter interpretation, however, the nucleation
rate of ads black holes would be very much suppressed compared with that of black cigars
attached to the brane when the size of the instantons is larger than the ads radius. the
tidal forces exerted by such black holes on the brane manifest themselves as an additional
term in the friedmann equation which dilutes like radiation. in the spirit of the ads/cf t
correspondence, this may be attributed to thermal radiation in the boundary theory. in this
case, for temperatures much lower than the ads scale, the entropy of this radiation agrees
with the entropy of the black hole in the ve dimensional theory.

the fact that the euclidean action of brane instantons reduces to the corresponding
4-dimensional action in the low energy limit is reassuring. in particular, this suggests that
most of the predictions made in the standard 4-dimensional quantum cosmological context
are qualitatively valid also in brane-world scenarios. an exception may occur for instantons
describing the creation of open universes from nothing [28]. these instantons are singular
in four dimensions, and therefore a dierent behaviour of gravity at high densities and short
distances can make a dierence in the euclidean action. this case is left for further study.

[22] the use of compact euclidean solutions in order to describe nucleation processes in a pre-
existing background is the subject of some debate (see e.g. [23,24] for a recent discussion).
the problem is that the instanton itself does not represent a semiclassical path interpolating
between the original conguration and the conguration after tunneling. (incidentally, this is
true even for the well-known coleman-de lucchia instanton describing false vacuum decay

15

in the presence of gravity). here, we shall not dwelve into this problem, adopting the inter-
pretation given in the original references. our emphasis will be in the case corresponding to
creation from nothing, where the interpretation of instantons as semiclassical paths is perhaps
less controversial.
