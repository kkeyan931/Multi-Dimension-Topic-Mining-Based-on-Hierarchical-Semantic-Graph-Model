abstract

based on numerical results in lattice yang-mills theory, it is argued that the
nonperturbative dynamics of yang mills theory can be described by a set of elds
that take their values in the coset space su(2)/u(1). the yang-mills connection
is parameterized in a special way to separate the dependence on the coset eld.
the coset eld is then regarded as a collective variable, and a method to obtain its
eective action is developed. it is argued that the physical excitations of the eective
action may be knot solitons. a procedure to calculate the mass scale of knot solitons
is discussed for lattice gauge theories in the maximal abelian projection. a relation
between the large n limit and the monopole dominance in the su(n) yang-mills
theory is pointed out.

(1.2)

where the eld n(x) is a unit three-dimensional vector, n  n = 1, m is a mass scale
and g is a coupling constant, describes knot solitons in four-dimensional spacetime. the
stability of solitons is due to the conservative charge known as the hopf invariant [1].
the knot solitons have a nite energy and, therefore, may be identied with particle-
like excitations, provided a physical interpretation is given to the n eld. an interesting
relation between the action (1.1) and the su(2) yang-mills theory action emerges if one
takes the connection of the form [2]

a = g1n  n  a(n) ,

that is, the second term of the action (1.1) is the yang-mills action for the connection
of the special form (1.3). it is therefore rather natural to conjecture that the rst term
can be generated by an interaction of the collective variable n with the other modes of
the full yang-mills theory [3, 4].
if such a conjecture is true, it would mean that the
su(2) quantum yang-mills theory has particle-like excitations being knot solitons. these
excitations might be good candidates for glueballs. since the energy of knot solitons is
concentrated along a contour in space [5], an eective action for the eld n would also
provide a quantum eld description of polyakovs strings.

in this letter we discuss a physical interpretation of the eld n. based on recent
developments in lattice gauge theories, we argue that the special yang-mills connections
(1.3) describe the most relevant physical degrees of freedom of the yang-mills theory in
the connement phase. we develop a procedure to calculate their eective action. the
mass scale m2 is described in terms of expectation values of some functionals of a. we
also propose a numerical procedure to calculate an eective action of the eld n using
the wilson ensemble of the lattice gauge theory in the maximal abelian projection. the
approach is extended to the su(n) yang-mills theory.

2 a general parameterization of the su(2) connection

consider a partition function of the su(2) yang-mills theory

z  z da es(a) .

(2.1)

here s(a) is the yang-mills action. we assume that some gauge xing has been made to
remove the divergence of the integral (2.1) caused by the gauge invariance of the action
s. for what follows the gauge choice is not important. in the integral (2.1) we want to
make a change of integration variables

a = g1n  n + cn + w ,

(2.2)

where the rst two terms is the connection introduced by cho [2], which we denote by ,
i.e., a =  + w, and the isovector w is perpendicular to n, that is, n  w = 0. the
idea is then to integrate out c and w and obtain an eective action for n. however,
we observe that the number of independent eld variables in the left hand side of eq.(2.2)
is 12, while in the right hand side is 14 (4 in c, 2 in n and 8 in w). to make a change
of variables, we have to impose two more conditions on w.

before doing so, let us analyze the gauge transformation law in the new variables. a

gauge transformation of a contains three functional parameters

a = g1 + a    g1(a) .

(2.3)

the variations c, n and w that induce the gauge transformations (2.3) of the
connection (2.2) should depend on ve functional parameters because they may also
involve variations under which a does not change at all. note that the number of

2

the new variables exceeds that of the old variables exactly by 2. consider a special subset
of these ve-parametric transformations which has the form

n = n   ,

c = g1n   ,

w = w   .

(2.4)

we have  = g1() and, therefore, the transformations (2.4) induce the gauge
transformations (2.3). the condition n  w = 0 is invariant under the transformations
(2.4). hence, the gauge transformed congurations have the same form (2.2).

if we impose two additional conditions on w which are covariant under the trans-
formations (2.4), then the transformations (2.4) can be uniquely identied as the gauge
transformations of the new variables. we propose the following conditions

()w = w + cn  w + n(n  w) = 0 .

(2.5)

it is not hard to see that the covariant derivative ()w transforms as an isovector
under (2.4). moreover, taking the dot product of the right hand side of eq. (2.5) and n,
we nd n  w + n  w = (n  w)  0 because the isovectors n and w are
perpendicular. thus, the right hand side of eq. (2.5) is an isovector perpendicular to
n and, therefore, the condition (2.5) implies only two independent conditions on w as
required.

so, we have obtained a change of variables and identied the gauge transformation law
of the new variables. in principle one can inverse it and nd the new variables as functional
of a. we will discuss this later upon constructing the path integral measure for the new
variables. one should point out that there are innitely many ways to parameterize the
yang-mills connection. natural questions arise. why is the parameterization we have
chosen so special? why is an eective action for the collective variable n = n(a) has
something to do with the dynamics of the yang-mills theory in the connement phase?
let us discuss these important questions before we turn to constructing an eective action
for n.

3 properties of the new parameterization of the su(2) connection

eqs. (2.2) and (2.5) determine a complete parameterization of a generic su(2) connection.
the parameterization has several remarkable properties which we are going to discuss.
consider an isovector b = b(n) which is constructed of the eld n and its derivatives
so that b  n = 0. since n  n = 0, such an isovector can always be taken as a linear
combinations b = bn with the coecients b being functions of n and its derivatives.
let us construct a complex scalar eld

 = b  w + in  (b  w) .

(3.1)

consider gauge transformations that leave the eld n unchanged. these are rotations
about n, i.e.,  = n in (2.4). we get c = g1 and  = i. that is, the eld c
is a maxwell eld with respect to the gauge subgroup u(1) which is a stationary group of
n, while the scalar eld  plays the role of a charged eld. if for some reasons we would

3

like to describe the su(2) yang-mills theory as an eective qed, the set of elds c, 
and n is just enough to carry all physical degrees of freedom of the original su(2) theory.
this can be understood as follows. the eld w has six independent components in our
parameterization of the su(2) connection. using the isotopic rotations we may impose two
gauge conditions on w to break su(2) to u(1). amongst the remaining four components
of w we can always select two (real) components which are to be identied with the
complex scalar eld  by a suitable choice of b. the other two components are uniquely
xed by the gauss law s/a0 = 0. recall that the su(2) gauge theory has three
lagrange multipliers a0. if we impose a gauge condition on the dynamical variables ai
(i = 1, 2, 3) with the aim to get a dynamical description only in terms of the physical
degrees of freedom, then the lagrange multipliers must be obtained by solving the gauss
law for a0 in the gauge (or parameterization) chosen for ai. since u(1) is left unbroken
as the gauge group of the theory, only two equations in the gauss law are to be solved so
that the lagrange multiplier c0 associated with the u(1) symmetry does not get xed.
thus, in such an eective abelian gauge theory, which is dynamically equivalent to the
non-abelian su(2) theory, the eld w carries only two physical degrees of freedom
associated with the complex scalar eld (3.1). here only an eective dynamics of n (an
eective eld theory for polyakovs strings) will be discussed and, therefore, an explicit
parameterization of w via physical variables is not relevant. such a parameterization is
important to formulate duality properties in yang-mills theory [3, 4].

what is the physical meaning of the eld n in the eective abelian gauge theory
described above? to answer this question let us make an abelian projection (in t hoofts
terminology [6]) of the yang-mills theory by imposing a gauge on the eld n rather than
on w. by a suitable gauge rotation of the isovector n we can always direct it along,
say, the third coordinate axis in the isospace, i.e., n = n0 = (0, 0, 1). in this case the
eld w would have four physical degrees of freedom (in the sense of the hamiltonian
formalism as described above). moreover, since the conditions (2.5) are covariant under
gauge transformations, the gauge transformed elds c, w and n should also satisfy
them. setting n equal to n0 in (2.5), the latter turns into the condition which is well
known in lattice yang-mills theories as the maximal abelian gauge [7].

the reason of why the maximal abelian gauge is so special in lattice yang-mills
theory is the following. suppose congurations aq
, q = 1, 2, ..., q, are elements of the
wilson ensemble, i.e., they are generated by means of the monte-carlo method with
the boltzmann probability exp[s(a)]. an expectation value of any quantity f (a) is

hf i = q1 pq f (aq). for example, one can take f = wc to be the wilson loop. from
hwci one nds the string tension su(2) which is a coecient in the linearly rising part of
the potential between a heavy quark and antiquark. for every conguration aq
 one can
nd a gauge transformation u = u(aq) such that the gauge transformed conguration
has the form uaq
 satisfy the condition (2.5)
with n = n0. that is, every conguration from the wilson ensemble have been gauge
transformed to satisfy the maximal abelian gauge. now one takes only the abelian parts
n0
 are abelian congurations (the
action is quadratic in c), one would expect the perimeter law corresponding to the

 and use them to calculate hwci. as uc q

coulomb interaction of static sources rather than the area law, i.e., one would expect the
corresponding string tension u(1) to vanish. a surprising numerical result is that such a
procedure gives the area law again, and u(1) is nearly the same as the full string tension
su(2) (to be exact, it is 92 per cent of su(2)). the phenomenon is called the abelian
dominance [9, 8]. it might look rather mysterious especially in view of that wc(a) is a
gauge invariant quantity.

the paradox disappears if one observes that the gauge transformations u(aq) that
are used to implement the maximal abelian gauge are not regular in spacetime (e.g.,
u [, ]u 6= 0). strictly speaking, they are no gauge transformations because the tensor
quantities, like, e.g., the eld strength, are no longer transformed homogeneously. for this
reason the abelian vector potential uc q
 has singularities (or defects) which
have quantum numbers of dirac magnetic monopoles with respect to the unbroken u(1)
gauge group. therefore the maxwell vector potential uc q
 describes dynamics of photons
and also that of dirac magnetic monopoles which are physical degrees of freedom of the
wilson ensemble in the maximal abelian gauge. 2

 = n0  uaq

thus, the singular transformations u(aq) transfer some relevant physical degrees of
freedom from the non-abelian components (perpendicular to n0) of the connection to the
abelian ones (parallel to n0). these degrees of freedom have been identied as dirac
magnetic monopoles. locations of monopoles can be found by studying the magnetic ux
carried by uc q
 through surfaces around each dual lattice cite [7]. since regular (photon)
congurations of uc q
 cannot provide the area law for the wilson loop, the monopole
part of uc q
if one
removes the photon part from uc q
 and calculate hwci using only the monopole part
of uc q
, the corresponding string tension m diers from u(1) only by 5 per cent, i.e.,
m  u(1)  su(2). this is known as the monopole dominance [10, 8].

 must be expected to give a major contribution to u(1)  su(2).

the conclusion one obviously arrives at is that the nonperturbative yang-mills dy-
namics favors congurations which look like dirac magnetic monopoles in the maximal
abelian gauge. an interpretation of these degrees of freedom as dirac monopoles is gauge
dependent, but the very fact of their existence is certainly gauge independent. these con-
gurations capture the most relevant degrees of freedom of the yang-mills theory in the
connement phase. this is a nontrivial dynamical statement discovered in lattice gauge
theories. note that an explicit form of aq
 is determined by the full yang-mills action,
and it is by no means obvious that the dynamics must be such that the congurations
that saturate the area law should look like dirac magnetic monopoles in some particular
gauge.

in our parameterization of the su(2) connection the maximal abelian gauge is a simple
algebraic gauge n = n0. therefore we expect that for some connections aq
 the gauge
transformation which transforms n(aq) to the special form n0 is not regular, and the
gauge transformed abelian potential uc q
 should have singularities which have quantum
numbers of dirac monopoles with respect residual gauge group u(1) (rotations about n0).
as the condition (2.5) is covariant under the gauge transformations (2.4) and turns into

2in fact, this is the case for any abelian projection [6], but not for every abelian projection the

abelian (or monopole) dominance holds [8].

 and

), where u(aq)  su(2)/u(1) is dened so that uaq

satises the maximal abelian gauge, we conclude that our eld n should have the form

  n0(n0  uaq

 = uaq

 = n0  uaq

n(aq) =

2

tr h u (aq)3u(aq)i .

(3.2)

here the components of the isovector  are the pauli matrices, tr (ab) = 2ab. the
relation (3.2) determines the congurations of the eld n for the wilson ensemble. the
ensemble (3.2) contains all information about dynamics of the monopole degrees of free-
dom of the maximal abelian projection by construction.

in the continuum theory it is also easy to give examples of n with such properties. if we
set n(x, t) = gx/r, where r = |x|, then the conguration (1.3) is the famous non-abelian
monopole of wu and yang [11]. observe that the wu-yang monopole corresponds to
zero congurations of c and w in our parameterization. now we can implement the
maximal abelian projection. we can always nd an orthogonal matrix that transforms n
to the special form n0 = (0, 0, 1). this gauge transformation creates nonzero c according
to (2.4). the gauge transformed conguration becomes purely abelian, and c describes
a dirac magnetic monopole localized at the origin. note that the orthogonal matrix
used to direct n along the third coordinate axis is singular. this singularity generates
a singularity of c on the dirac string extended along the negative part of the third
coordinate axis. in general, we can set n = /, where  is the norm of an isovector eld
. if (x) = 0, then a solution to this equation is a collection of world lines x = xp
(s)
which are identied with the trajectories of of dirac monopoles carried by c after the
singular gauge transformation n  n0:

g1n  n + cn  hg1n0  (  ) + ci n0 = ucn0  (c 

 + c)n0 ,

(3.3)

where  = (sin(/2) cos , sin(/2) sin , cos(/2)) if n = (sin  cos , sin  sin , cos ).
 in uc is the vector potential of magnetic monopoles in the maximal
the rst term c 
abelian projection.

thus, the collective variable n(a) captures the degrees of freedom responsible for the
abelian or monopole dominance discovered in lattice gauge theories. according to lattice
simulations, in the connement phase the monopole current (in the maximal abelian pro-
jection) is dense, while in the deconnement phase it is very dilute [8]. frankly speaking,
the monopoles condense in the connement phase, and one needs a eld (an order pa-
rameter) to describe their dynamics. a single maxwell eld uc cannot describe photons
and monopoles simultaneously because it has no independent components available as
the monopole eld. note that uc is a sum of the photon eld c and the monopole
eld c 
 in the maximal abelian projection (3.3). now we recall that the monopole
interpretation of the physical degrees of freedom of yang-mills theory which saturate the
area law is associated with a specic gauge. but once these degrees of freedom have
been identied as those of the eld n, there is no need in that gauge anymore. instead
of imposing the (maximal abelian) gauge n = n0 and facing a hard problem to nd a
quantum eld description of monopole defects in uc, we say that in the connement

6

phase the collective eld n = n(a) should be identied as the most relevant degree of
freedom. therefore its eective action should capture the main features of the nonper-
turbative yang-mills dynamics. this is a gauge invariant approach to the monopole
dynamics because it uses only a reparameterization of the original yang-mills dynamical
variables via new collective variables and no gauge xing. the eective dynamics of n
can be studied in any abelian projection (gauge) if so desired.

the action in the variables (2.2) has the form

s(a) =

 + 2(w)2 + 4(gn + w)  w + w2

1
4 ng2

o ,

(3.4)

where  = (), w = w  w and g = c  c  h. it is quadratic in
c so the maxwell eld can be integrated out, while the integral over w can only be done
perturbatively, or in a stationary phase approximation by invoking instanton solutions, or
numerically. as a point of fact, lattice simulations show a correlation between monopole-
antimonopole loops and instantons [12]. so an instanton induced interaction of the eld
n might be an important piece of the eective action of n. in this regard it is noteworthy
[4] that wittens multi-instanton ansatz [13] can be written in our parameterization of
the su(2) connection as follows n = gx/r, w0 = 0, and

wi = 2(r, t)in  n + 1(r, t)in , ci = b1(r, t)ni , c0 = b2(r, t) .

(3.5)

here b1,2 and 1,2 are, respectively, two-dimensional electromagnetic and scalar elds
introduced by witten. note that the condition (2.5) is satised identically for the ansatz
(3.5).

4 an eective action for the n eld

to construct an eective action for the eld n, we observe that the change of variables
proposed in section 2 allows us to nd two equations which determine n as an implicit
functional of a. indeed, we have c = n  a. therefore

w = a  n(a  n)  g1n  n  a  (a, n) .

(4.1)

the eld w should satisfy the condition (2.5), which leads to the desired equations for
n = n(a):

(a, n)  (a)(a, n)  a = 0 .

(4.2)

it is easy to verify that n    0. so the isovector  is always perpendicular to n and,
hence, eq. (4.2) contains only two independent equations for two independent components
of n. consider the functional  = (a, n) dened by the equation

1 = z dn (a, n) () .

(4.3)

7

substituting the identity (4.3) into (2.1) we nd an equivalent representation of the yang-
mills partition function

z  z dn esef f (n) ,

sef f (n) =  lnz da (a, n) () es(a) .

(4.4)

(4.5)

the integral over yang-mills elds in (4.5) could be done analytically only either by
perturbation theory or by means of instantons. in the latter case the functional integral
is replaced by an ordinary integral over the instanton moduli space, while a is replaced
by an instanton conguration. to develop perturbation theory, one should write the
functional  as an integral over ghost elds. from the denition (4.3) of  it follows that
 = det(/n). introducing a set of complex ghost elds  such that   n = 0, we have

(a, n) = z dd expnsgh(, , a, n)o ,

(4.6)
sgh = z d4x   (a) [(n  a) + n(  a) + n    n  ] . (4.7)

the delta function of  in (4.5) can be written in the exponential form via the fourier
transform.

the ghosts introduced have nothing to do with a gauge xing. as has been pointed out
before, any gauge xing condition can be assumed in (2.1) by an appropriate modication
of the measure da. note that the integral (4.5) is invariant under simultaneous gauge
transformations of a and n (cf. (2.3) and (2.4)). if the ghost representation (4.6), (4.7)
is used, then the ghost eld is transformed as  =   . by imposing a gauge on a,
this gauge freedom is removed. therefore a gauge can be chosen to make computation
of the integral (4.5) convenient (e.g., the lorentz gauge for perturbation theory, or a
background gauge if the instanton technique is used). accordingly, there will also be a
conventional set of ghost elds associated with the gauge chosen.

it is convenient to make a shift of the integration variables a  a + g1n  n to
extract the tree level contribution to the eective action (the second term in (1.1)). if the
eective action (4.5) supports knot solitons as collective excitations, then in the gradient
expansion of (4.5) there should exist the mass scale m2 6= 0 which is determined by the
equation

= m2ab2

(x  y) .

(4.8)

2sef f (n)

na(x)nb(y)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)n=0

substituting (4.5) into (4.8) we obtain the mass scale in terms of expectation values of
certain operators in the yang-mills theory. as has been argued in [3], the mass scale term
must be a leading term in the gradient expansion of the eective action sef f (n). however,
it may also appear to be zero. since there is no monopole dominance in the perturbative
regime, there must be a nonperturbative input into calculation of m2.

one way to do so is to calculate m2 numerically. suppose we have a wilson ensemble of
a. for every conguration a one can calculate the group element u(a) such that ua

8

satises the maximal abelian gauge. next, by means of (3.2) one can obtain an ensemble
of the eld n. the problem is to nd the boltzmann probability exp(sef f (n)) which
generates the ensemble of n. such a problem can be solved by the so called inverse monte-
carlo method [14]. this method has recently been applied to calculate an eective action
of the monopole current in the maximal abelian projection [15]. it would be interesting to
apply this numerical technique to prove the existence of the mass scale m2. the radiative
corrections to the action (1.1) can be obtained by perturbation theory proposed above.

the mass scale term in (1.1) looks like a mass term in the (reduced) yang-mills theory

of the special connection (1.3)

m2n  n = g2m2a2

(n) .

(4.9)

this suggests also that the inverse monte-carlo method can be applied to the ensemble of
a(n) directly. if one takes the ensemble of monopole connections n0c 
 in the maximal
abelian projection (i.e., after the projection all o-diagonal components of the connections
as well as the photon part in the diagonal components are set to zero), then the ensemble of
a(n) can be obtained by gauge transformations u (a) of n0c 
 because by construction
(3.3) we have ua(n) = n0c 
. here u(a) are gauge group elements which are used to
implement the maximal abelian gauge on the wilson ensemble.

5 a generalization to the su(n) gauge group

a realistic theory has the gauge group su(3). the monopole dominance has also been
established for the su(3) lattice gauge theory in the maximal abelian projection (see, e.g.,
[8] and references therein). here we construct a parameterization of the su(n) connection
such that the monopole degrees of freedom in the maximal abelian projection are
described by a coset eld su(n)/[u(1)]n 1. we also show that such a parameterization
is of the type proposed recently by faddeev and niemi [16] rather than that of perival
[17]. to develop an eective action of the coset eld, we follow the method discussed
above for the su(2) case, meaning that no explicit elimination of nonphysical degrees of
freedom is made, and thereby a hard problem (unsolved in [16, 17]) of solving the gauss
law is avoided. we shall point out an interesting relation emerging between the large n
limit and the monopole dominance.

let hi, i = 1, 2, ..., n  1, be a basis of the cartan subalgebra of the algebra su(n). we
assume the basis to be orthonormal with respect to the killing form (hi, hk) = ik. recall
that for any two elements of a lie algebra the killing form is dened as (y, z) = tr(yz),
where yz = [y, z] and [, ] is a lie product in the lie algebra. in a matrix representation
(y, z) = c tr(yz), where c depends on the lie algebra [18] (c = 2n for su(n)). consider an
orthonormal cartan-weyl basis [18] so that every lie algebra element can be decomposed
as

khk .

(5.1)

 = x>0(cid:16)c

c + s

s(cid:17) + xk

here  ranges over all positive roots of the algebra, and the coecients c,s
 , k are real.
in what follows we will only need the basis commutation relations [h, c] = i(h, )s and

9

[h, s] = i(h, )c (for any element h from the cartan subalgebra). so the other basis
commutation relations are omitted. they can be found in, e.g., the textbook [18]. let
u(x)  su(n)/[u(1)]n 1 and nk = u hku. since the killing form is invariant under the
adjoint action of the group, we conclude (ni, nk) = ik. we set (cf. [16])

a = ig1n[nk, nk] + nkc k

 + w   + w ,

where (nk, w) = 0 and w also satises the following n 2  n conditions

()w  w + igc k

[nk, w]  n [[nk, nk], w] = 0 .

(5.2)

(5.3)

the connection a has 4(n 2  1) independent components which are now represented by
n 2  n independent functions in nk, 4(n  1) functions in c k
 and 4(n 2  1)  (n 2 
n)  4(n  1) functions in w.

the gauge transformation law in the new variables reads

nk = i[nk, ] ,

w = i[w, ] ,

c k

 = g1(nk, ) .

(5.4)

to prove this, we have to show that the transformations (5.4) induce an innitesimal
gauge transformation of a: a = g1(a). comparing the gauge transformations
of the left- and right-hand sides of eq. (5.2), we nd that the relation

 = n [nk, [nk, ]] + nk(nk, )

(5.5)

 ]] = i(hk, )[nk, cu

 ] = (hk, )2su

 and, similarly, [nk, [nk, cu

[nk, [nk, su

has to hold for any . consider a local cartan-weyl orthonormal basis cu
 = u cu,
su
 = u su and nk. we decompose the element  in this local basis and compute
the commutators in the l.h.s. of eq. (5.5) by means of the cartan-weyl commutation
relations:
 ]] =
(hk, )2cu
 , while [nk, nj] = 0. relation (5.5) follows from the resolution of unity in the
local cartan-weyl basis, provided pk(hk, )2 = 1/n for every root . as hk form an
pk(hk, )2 = (, ) = tr 2 = 1/n. the latter means that all roots of su(n) should

orthonormal basis in the cartan subalgebra with respect to the killing form, we have

have the same norm, which is easily established from the dynkin diagram for su(n). to
compute the norm, we set (, ) = b for any root and calculate the matrix elements of
 by applying it to the basis elements of the cartan-weyl basis, then from the relation
(, ) = tr 2 and the root pattern it follows that b = 1/n. thus, relation (5.5) is a true
identity. in a similar fashion, one can show that (nk, ()w) = (nk, w)  0, i.e.,
eq. (5.3) indeed contains only n 2  1  (n  1) = n 2  n independent conditions on
w.

now it easy to see that in our parameterization the maximal abelian gauge is an alge-
braic gauge nk(x) = hk. given a connection a, one can nd u(a)  su(n)/[u(1)]n 1
such that ua satises the maximal abelian gauge. the maxwell elds in the maxi-
mal abelian projection uc k
 = (hk, ua) carry dirac monopoles. by construction these
monopole degrees of freedom are described by the coset elds nk(a) = u (a)hku(a)
in our parameterization. if (x) is a local operator that transforms in the adjoint repre-
sentation of the gauge group, then by a gauge transformation it can always be brought to

10

the cartan subalgebra. such a gauge transformation will be singular at spacetime points
where a special gauge invariant polynomial of  has zeros [19]. this polynomial is the
jacobian of the change of variables  = u 1hu where h is an element of the cartan sub-
algebra. in particular, for the su(n) group, the singularities form world lines which can
be identied with trajectories of magnetic monopoles in the eective [u(1)]n 1 abelian
gauge theory [19]. therefore, if nk  /(, )1/2, the gauge transformation nk  hk is
singular, in general, and creates dirac magnetic monopoles in the maxwell elds uc k
.

an eective action of the elds nk can be calculated similarly to the case of su(2)
discussed in section 4. a generalization is straightforward, so we omit the details. a
few concluding remarks are in order. a remarkable fact that all roots of su(n) have the
same norm was crucial to establish a relation between the monopole congurations of
the maximal abelian projection and the parameterization (5.2) of the su(n) connection.
clearly, for any other compact gauge group the parameterization (5.2), (5.3) is not ap-
plicable. this should not be regarded as a drawback. note that only for su(n), abelian
projections lead to monopole-like defects in gauge elds [6]. for instance, for so(n) the
defects would be objects extended in space, like nielsen-olsen strings [6]. so it is natural
to expect a dierent form of the connection that captures such degrees of freedom.

it is also rather interesting that the monopole part of the su(n) connection (5.2)
has the factor n. so in the large n limit it has to play the role of dominant degrees
of freedom, which implies that there exists a relation between the large n limit and the
monopole dominance in gauge theories. finally we remark that an eective action for the
elds nk may support solitons, provided the leading term (quadratic in derivatives nk)
of the gradient expansion does not vanish [16]. the large n expansion seems a natural
analytical method to verify this conjecture.
