abstract

a formula describing nite renormalizations is derived in the epstein-glaser
formalism and an explicit calculation of nite counterterms in 4-theory is per-
formed. the zimmermann identities and the action principle for changes of pa-
rameters and external elds are presented.

1 introduction

renormalization is an old art of removing divergences which occur unavoidably in
qft. in course of time many calculational techniques, more or less mathematical,
were developped. usually the more mathematical formulations of renormalization
were too abstract for practical purposes, like the epstein glaser approach [epgl1] of
renormalization. apart from the work of scharf [scha] and stora [post] [sto] nothing
was done in this framework for a long time. nevertheless a further developement of
the epstein glaser method is worth wile, because it turned out that this method is
best suited for the construction of theories on curved space times [brfr] [d ufr]. its
advantages are the local character and the formulation in position space.
another more abstract formulation of renormalization theory is the bphz- renormal-
ization. in this framework some fundamental results of the structure of renormaliza-
tion were achieved, namely the forest formula and the action principle. breitenlohner
and maison [brma] succeeded in formulating the action principle also in dimensional
renormalization.
in this work we will give a formulation of nite renormalizations in the epstein
glaser approach corresponding to the forest formula. furthermore we formulate and

1

prove the part of the action principle concerning the changes of parameters and ex-
ternal elds. to ll the gap between the theoretical formulation and practical calcu-
lations we demonstrate how the renormalization of the s-matrix in 4-theory works
up to the third order.
many calculations concerning renormalization can be found in the book of zavialov
[zav]. often they are similar to the results presented here, but they are not formu-
lated in the sense of distributions.
to make this work selfcontained, we sometimes repeat some results of other articles
in a form tting to our calculations. we hope it is helpful for the reader to get a better
understanding of the method.
this work is divided into ve sections. in the rst one we briey repeat the founda-
tions of causal perturbation theory in the framework of the wightman axioms.
in the next section we give a mathematical description of the time ordered product.
the inductive construction of epstein and glaser [epgl1] is described. the main re-
sult of this section is the description of nite renormalizations by a family of functions
n.
section 4 is a preparation for the calculations of section 5 and a short summary of
[scha] [epgl1] [fre] [brfr]. after some microlocal analysis we see that renormaliza-
tion is nothing else than an extension of distributions on an appropriate space of test
functions. we repeat the lorentz invariant form of the extension of [brpipr] which is
used in the calculations and discuss some properties of the w -operator.
in section 5 we renormalize the s-matrix of 4-theory up to the third order. in con-
trast to other renormalizations in momentum space the difculty grows not with the
number of loops but of vertices in a diagram. so the second order calculation is trivial
because the treatment of subdivergences rst appears in the third order calculation.
to come back to the abstract formulation of the epstein glaser approach we list the
normalization conditions for a scalar theory. some of them are an abstract form of the
rules used in the calculations. we show that the dyson schwinger equations (dse)
can be derived from the normalization condition n4 in 4-theory.
in the next section we derive the action principle for changes of parameters and
external elds [low]. the basis of the rst subsection is the theorem of perturbative
renormalization theory [post]. with the form of nite renormalizations derived in
section 2 we are able to give the explicit form of the counterterms in the lagrangian
compensating a change of renormalization. then we dene a notion of an insertion
and prove the counting properties of them. relations of insertions of different degrees
are described by the zimmermann identities [zim]. with the preceding results it
is easy to formulate them in the framework of the epstein glaser renormalization.
finally we prove the action principle, which also holds only for the connected and
the 1pi-parts of the s-matrix. with these results a derivation of the renormalization
group equations (rge) as in [low] is possible.
the rge and the dse are also valid outside the perturbation theory. they serve
as an important tool for nonperturbative constructions and methods, see for exam-
ple [zin] and [sti]. the action principle is used in algebraic renormalization [piso],
which leads to a systematic renormalization of the standard model of elektroweak
interaction to all orders of perturbation theory [kra].
this work is a rst step of a translation of these methods to the epstein glaser

2

formulation of renormalization.
we always use the manifold r4 with the minkowski metric for spacetime. with the
work of [fre], [brfrko], [brfr], [rad] it should be easy to formulate the arguments
on curved space times, often one only has to replace r4 by an arbitrary manifold m
with minkowski metric.

2 causal perturbation theory and epstein glaser

renormalization

a mathematical precise formulation of a qft was given by g arding and wightman
[wiga]. they treat a qft as a tupel

(h, u, , d, |0i)

(1)

of a separable hilbert space h, a unitary representation of the restricted poincare
group p 
+, eld operators , a dense space d of h and the vacuum vector |0i. the
tupel has to fulll the wightman axioms [stwi]. among others they state that the
elds  are local operatorvalued distributions, welldened on the dense domain d of
the hilbert space. d contains the vacuum. in the construction of the s-matrix it is
sufcient to regard the dense domain d0  d  h, consisting of all vectors which
can be constructed by applying a nite set of eld operators to the vacuum:

d0 = {  h| = (f1) . . . (fn)|0i, n  n}.

(2)

therefore any formulation of perturbation theory has to take into account the dis-
tribution character of the elds and interaction terms, and it has to make sure that
the operators are well dened on d (or in the case of the s-matrix on d0). causal
perturbation theory is in the sense of this axioms, because it has all these properties.
it was founded by the work of stueckelberg [stu], bogoliubov and shirkov [bosh]. in
their formulation every interaction term is accompanied by a test function

g  s(cid:0)r4(cid:1) ,

g : r4  [0, 1]

(3)

which switches the interaction on and off at different space time points (s is the
schwartz space of testfunctions). g vanishes at innity and therefore provides for a
cutoff for long range interactions. all quantities of the causal construction are formal
power series in this function, especially the s-matrix is constructed with the following
ansatz:

s (g) = 1 +

in

n!z d4x1 . . .z d4xn sn (x1, . . . , xn) g (x1) . . . g (xn) .

xn=1

(4)

the coefcients sn are operatorvalued distributions, smeared with the switching
function g(x), such that each term in the sum is a welldened operator on d0.

3

epstein and glaser [epgl1] have found that the sn can be determined by a few phys-
ical properties of the s-matrix, namely

1. translation covariance

2. lorentz covariance

3. unitarity

4. causality

and the renormalization conditions. actually for the inductive construction of the
sn proposed by epstein and glaser only causality is important. to prove that the
resulting s(g) is a welldened operator on d0 they apply wicks theorem and need
the translation covariance. in [brfr] it is shown how the translation covariance can
be substituted by a condition on the wavefronsets of the sn. this makes the method
work on curved space times, too. the other properties are realized by the normaliza-
tion conditions.
with some calculations, the properties above are transfered to the following proper-
ties of the coefcients sn:

1. translation covariance: sn (x + a) = u (a) sn (x) u 1 (a).

2. lorentz covariance: sn (x) = u (0, ) sn(x)u 1 (0, ).

3. in the following, we will often work with sets of indices. we will denote with j =
{1, . . . , n} the full set of indices and with i any subset of j. for i = {i1, . . . , ik}
we use the notation

sk (xj|j  i) := sk (xi1, . . . , xik ) .

from the unitarity condition the following equation is obtained:

sk (xi|i  i) s+

nk (xj|j  j \ i) = 0.

xij

|i|=k

4. causality of the s-matrix yields the factorization property:

(5)

(6)

sn (x1, . . . , xn) = si (x1, . . . , xi) sni (xi+1, . . . , xn)

(7)

for {x1, . . . , xi} & {xi+1, . . . , xn}, where x & y means that y lies not in the future
light cone of x.

this property implies the locality of the sn:

[sn (x1, . . . , xn) , sm (y1, . . . , ym)] = 0 if all the xi are spacelike to the yj.

4

the factorisation property (7) is used to identify the coefcients sn with timeordered
products. if we further demand s1 = lint the higher sn can be constructed inductively
[epgl1]. this is described in the next section.
from the s-matrix the interacting elds can be obtained by the following formula of
bogoliubov [bosh]:

g(h) =

d
d

s1(g)s(g + h)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0

.

(8)

they are formal power series in the switching function g like the s-matrix. to get rid
of this function at the end of the construction the adiabatic limit g(x)  1 has to be
performed. this limit bears some problems, because all infrared divergences appear
which were avoided in the local formulation. in case of all greens functions exist in
the sense of tempered distributions for g  1 the adiabatic limit exists in the weak
sense. if it is further shown that for g  1 the s-matrix is a unitary operator, the
adiabatic limit exists in the strong sense.
the weak adiabatic limit is proved to exist for massive theories [epgl1], qed and
massless  : 2n : theories [blse]. the existence of the adiabatic limit in the strong
sense has only been proved for massive theories [epgl2].

3 the time ordered product

for a precise mathematical formulation, the t -products introduced in this section
are not dened as usual on wick monomials of quantized elds, but on an algebra
p(r4) generated by classical elds. this idea is introduced in [boa]. the generators
of the algebra p are classical elds i(x) and their derivatives. they are called sym-
bols, because there is no relation like the klein-gordon equation between the gener-
ators, so that the elds and their derivatives are linear independent. wick products

the time ordered product (t -product) is a family of maps tn, n  n, called tn-
products. they are functions from p n into the operatorvalued distributions on

: (x1) . . . (xn) : are operatorvalued distributions on d(cid:0)r4n(cid:1).
d(cid:0)r4n(cid:1), consisting of products of numerical distributions with wick products. they

have the following properties:

1. t0 = 1

 v  p.

t1 (v (x)) = : v (x) :
we see that t1 is surjective but not injective, because the wick products obey

the wave equation. for example, in 4-theory we obtain t1(cid:0) + m2(cid:1) = 0.

2. symmetry in the arguments:

tn (v1(x1) . . . vn(xn)) = tn (v1(x1) . . . vn(xn))

   sn
 vi  p, i = 1, . . . n,

(9)

where sn is the set of all permutations of n elements.

5

3. the factorization property:

tn (v1(x1) . . . vn(xn)) = ti (v1(x1) . . . vi(xi)) tni (vi+1(xi+1) . . . vn(xn))

(10)

if {x1, . . . , xi} & {xi+1, . . . , xn} and vi  p  i.

we remark that the tn are multilinear functionals in the arguments v , for instance
t2(v1(x1)+v2(x2), v3(x3)) = t2(v1(x1), v3(x3))+t2(v2(x2), v3(x3)). therefore it sufces
to know their values for one kind of interaction term v (polarization identity), and we
can omit the indices of the v . tn-products dened on wick monomials of free elds
are not linear, because of

t2(cid:16):(cid:0) + m2(cid:1) (x) :
, : (y) :(cid:17) =(cid:0) + m2(cid:1) if (x  y) = i(x  y) 6= 0.
|
}

in the following we denote with dn the total diagonal of r4n:

{z

=0

dn = {(x1, . . . , xn)  r4n|x1 = x2 = . . . xn}.

(11)

(12)

to construct higher tn-products with the help of the factorization identity as expres-
sions of lower tn-products we need the notion of a partition of unity.
in the fol-
lowing denition, we denote with i the nonempty subsets of the set of indices j:
 6= i ( j = {1, . . . , n}.

denition 3.1 a partition of unity in r4n \ dn is a set of c-functions
f (n)
i

: r4n \ dn  r with the following properties:

1. suppf (n)

i = {(x1, . . . , xn)  r4n \ dn | xi . xj i  i, j  i c}

2. p i(j

i6=

f (n)
i

= 1.

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r4n\dn

now we can write a tn-product with noncoinciding arguments according to the fac-
torization property (10) in the following way:

tn (v (x1) . . . v (xn))(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r4n\dn

=xi(j

i6=

f (n)

i t|i|yji

v (xj) t|i c| yki c

v (xk)! .

(13)

the last step in this construction of epstein and glaser [epgl1] is the extension of
the right hand side of (13) to the total diagonal. this extension is not unique, so there
are several different t -products. in renormalization theory this corresponds to the
free choice of the renormalization constants.
to describe the structure of nite renormalizations, we rst have to dene the tn-
products on p-valued distributions a of the form

6

a = xi

aipi(x)(i1)(x1  x) . . . (ik)(xk  x),

(14)

a denes a linear map:

with pi(x)  p(cid:0)r4(cid:1) and constants ai. according to the schwartz kernel theorem [hor]
a : d(cid:16)r4k(cid:17)  p

7 a (g1, . . . , gk) =z d4x1 . . .z d4xk a(x1, . . . xk)g1(x1) . . . gk(xk).

g1  . . .  gk

the tn-products of a are dened as linear maps:

tn+1 (a, p1, . . . , pn) : d(cid:16)r4k(cid:17)  d(cid:16)r4(n+1)(cid:17)

g1  . . .  gk

7 tn+1 (a(g1, . . . , gk), p1, . . . , pn) .

because of supp a  dk we can interchange the integration with the t -product,

tn+1 (a(g1, . . . , gk), p1, . . . , pn) =z dx1 . . .z dxk tn+1 (a, p1, . . . , pn) g1 . . . gk,
and regard the tn-products as maps from p n  d(cid:0)r4k(cid:1) to d(cid:0)r4(n+1)(cid:1).

now we can describe the structure of nite renormalizations with the following the-
orem, which arose from discussions with k. fredenhagen:

theorem 3.1 let t, t be two different t -products. then there are sets of functions
n from p n into p-valued distributions of the form (14) with supp n  dn and

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

tn(cid:16)qjj v (xj)(cid:17) = xp p art(j)

t|p |hyoip

|oi|(cid:16)qjoi

v (xj)(cid:17)i.

proof: we construct the n inductively by the following formula:

n

:= tn(cid:16)qjj v (xj)(cid:17)  xp p art(j )
= t1(cid:16)n(cid:16)qjj v (xj)(cid:17)(cid:17) .

|p |>1

t|p |hyoip

|oi|(cid:16)qjoi

v (xj)(cid:17)i

to show that this construction makes sense, we prove with induction over n that the
support of n is contained in dn. then it follows that n has the following form:

7

n =xi

ai : ai(x1) : (i2)(x2  x1) . . . (in)(xn  x1).

(20)

t1 is surjective, so for all i there is at least one pi  p with t1(pi) =: ai :, and with
these pi we dene

n :=xi

ai pi(x1) (i2)(x2  x1) . . . (in)(xn  x1).

(21)

the tn-products are dened on these n and it holds t1 (n) = n and supp(n) =
dn. equation (18) is automatically fullled by this construction. now we show with
induction that supp( n)  dn.
beginning of the induction:

 |n| = 1:

1(v (x)) = t1(v (x)) =: v (x) :

 |n| = 2:

2 (v (x1)v (x2)) = t2 (v (x1)v (x2))  t2 (1(v (x1))1(v (x2)))

= t2 (v (x1)v (x2))  t2 (v (x1)v (x2)) ,

and we saw in (13) that the difference of two t2-products has support in d2.

now we assume (x1, . . . , xn) 6 dn and have to show n (v (x1) . . . v (xn)) = 0. if
(x1, . . . , xn) 6 dn there are subsets of (x1, . . . , xn) which can be separated by a cauchy
surface. since the t are symmetric in the indices, we can assume without restriction
{x1, . . . , xi} . {xi+1, . . . , xn}. then we have with i = {1, . . . , i}:

tn(cid:16)qjj v (xj)(cid:17) = t|i c|(cid:16)qji cv (xj)(cid:17) t|i|(cid:16)qjiv (xj)(cid:17)

(22)

and with the induction hypothesis (supp m  dm for all m < n) we also obtain a
factorization of the second term of n

(23)

therefore we obtain

v (xj)(cid:17)i = 0
 xp p art(i)

t|p |hyoip

v (xj)(cid:17)i

(24)

because the n of lower order fulll equation (18) (cid:4).
for the interpretation of the operatorvalued distribution n we go back to equation
(13). the lower t -products on the right hand side of (13) consist themselves of prod-
ucts of lower t -products which were extended to a subdiagonal of r4n. we call the
extension to these subdiagonals the renormalization of subdivergences and the ex-
tension to the total diagonal in the last step the renormalization of the supercial
divergence.
fixing the extensions of all tn-products to the diagonals denes us a special t -
product. the distribution n of the theorem is the difference of t and t in the
renormalization of the supercial degree of divergence of (13), having all subdiver-
gences renormalized according to t .

4 renormalization as an extension of distributions

4.1 motivation

in this section we show that the extension of numerical distributions corresponds to
renormalization. we derive some properties of our extension procedure, compare it
with the usual way of renormalization in momentum space and apply it explicitly in
the next section to the renormalization of the second and third order of the s-matrix
in 4-theory, namely:

s(2) (g) =

s(3) (g) = 

1

1

2(cid:18) i
4!(cid:19)2z d4x1z d4x2 t2(cid:0)4 (x1) 4 (x2)(cid:1) g (x1) g (x2)
3!(cid:18) i
4!(cid:19)3z d4x1z d4x2z d4x3 t3(cid:0)4 (x1) 4 (x2) 4 (x3)(cid:1) 

g (x1) g (x2) g (x3) .

(25)

(26)

by means of wicks theorem the tn-products appearing in the expansion of the s-
matrix can be transformed for noncoincident points into linear combinations of prod-
ucts of numerical distributions with wick products. for instance t2 in s(2) (g) has for
noncoincident points the form:

9

t 0

2(cid:0)4 (x1) 4 (x2)(cid:1)

x16=x2=

4xk=0(cid:18) 4

k (cid:19)(cid:18) 4

k (cid:19) (4  k)! 

 (if (x1  x2))4k : k (x1) k (x2) : .

(27)

from theorem 0 of [epgl1] we know that the product of a welldened translation in-
variant numerical distribution with a wick product is welldened on d0. therefore
we only have to take care of the numerical distributions, denoted with t0 in the follow-
ing. in renormalization theory, t0 is for noncoincident points a product of feynman
propagators, therefore it is poincare invariant in minkowski space. problems arise
from the fact that feynman propagators are distributions and the product of distri-
butions is not always dened. the domain of denition depends on the singularities
of the individual factors, characterized by methods of the microlocal analysis.

4.2 some microlocal analysis

the content of this subsection can be found in [brfrko] [hor] [fre]. let m = r4n
or m  r4n be a manifold of dimension 4n and d(m) all c-functions on m with
compact support. the singular support of a distribution u  d(m), sing supp u, is
dened as the set of all points in m without any open neighbourhood to which the
restriction of u is a c function.
if a distribution v with compact support has no singularities, its fourier transform v
is asymptotically bounded for large  by

|v () |  cn (1 + ||)n

 n  n,   r4n,

(28)

where cn are constants for each n . any distribution u  d(m) is regular in y  m,
if for all functions f  c
0 (y ) the fourier transform of f u is asymptotically bounded
for large  by

|cf u () |  cn (1 + ||)n

 n  n,   r4n,

(29)

where cn are constants for each n . with sing supp u we denote the set of points of
m where u is not regular.
let u be singular at x  x  m, x  sing supp u. x  r4n \ 0 is the set of all  of the
cotangent space t 
0 (x) with
f (x) 6= 0 in a conic neighbourhood v of . x is a cone describing the direction of the
high frequencies causing the singularities at x. the pair of x and x is an element of
the wavefrontset:

x (x) such that (29) is not fullled for any function f  c

denition 4.1 if u  d (m), then the closed subset of m (cid:0)r4n \ {0}(cid:1)  t (m),

dened by

w f (u) =(cid:8)(x, )  m (cid:0)r4n \ {0}(cid:1) |   x (u)(cid:9)

is called the wavefrontset of u. the projection on m is sing supp u.

(30)

10

multiplication with a smooth function a  c and differentiation do not enlarge the
wave front set:

w f (au)  w f (u) ,
w f (du)  w f (u) .

(31)

(32)

for the existence of the pointwise product of two distributions u, v at x it is sufcient
to fulll the condition

(x, 0) / w f (u)  w f (v) = {(x, 1 + 2)|(x, 1)  w f (u) , (x, 2)  w f (v)} .

(33)

thus the product at x exists, if u or v or both are regular in x. if u and v are singular
at x, the product exists, if the second components in the wavefrontsets of u and v at x
cannot be added to the zerovector. if the product exists, its wavefrontset will fulll

w f (uv)  w f (u)  w f (v)  (w f (u) + w f (v)) .

(34)

we now check if the products of feynman propagators of scalar elds appearing in
(27),

(if (x1  x2))n

with n = 2, 3, 4

(35)

exist for all x1  x2. since if (x1  x2) is for x1 6= x2 a solution of the klein-
gordon equation, its singular support is contained in the characteristic set of the
klein-gordon operator, the forward and backward lightcone.
the wavefrontset set of the feynman propagator has the following form:

w f (f ) = {(x1, k; x2, k)  t 

x1 r4  t 

{(x1, k; x1, k), k 6= 0}.

x2r4(cid:12)(cid:12) (x1, k)  (x2, k), k  v+



if x1  j+


(x2)}

(36)

is the closed forward respectively backward light cone and j+


here v+
(x2) are all

points in m in the future respectively past of x2 which can be connected with x2 by
a causal curve . (x1, k)  (x2, m) means that x1 and x2 can be connected by a light
cone with cotangent vectors k and m at x1 and x2.
the sum of the second components of the wavefrontsets of two propagators vanishes

only at x1 = x2. therefore the products of (35) are dened on(cid:0)r4(cid:1)2 \ d2.

with (34) we are also able to investigate higher products of feynman propagators
occuring in higher orders of the s-matrix.

11

4.3 power counting of divergences

in momentum space calculations the ill denedness of products of feynman propaga-
tors corresponds to uv divergences of loop integrals. divergent terms can be found
by counting the powers of momenta in the loop integrals (power counting). the super-
cial degree of divergence of a diagram corresponds in position space to the singular
order at the total diagonal of the numerical distribution belonging to this diagram.
we rst introduce the denition of the scaling degree of a distribution:

denition 4.2 the scaling degree of a numerical distribution t  d(r4n) at the ori-
gin is dened by

sd(t) := infn(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)lim

the singular order is now given by

t (x1, . . . , xn) = 0 in the sense of distributionso .

(37)

denition 4.3 the singular order of a numerical distribution t  d(r4n) at the
origin is dened by

sing ord t = [sd(t)]  nd

(38)

where d is the space time dimension.

there exist different denitions of the scaling degree in the literature. the denition
above is the steinmann scaling degree [ste]. the singular order of a distribution with
respect to this scaling degree is not larger than the supercial degree of divergence
obtained by power counting in momentum space [brfr]. in [brfr] is also given a
denition of a scaling degree of a distribution with respect to a submanifold, called
microlocal scaling degree.
as an example we derive the scaling degree and the singular order of the feynman
propagator for scalar massive elds at 0:

if (z) =

1

(2)2

for small z we have the expansion of k1:

mk1(cid:18)mq(z)2(cid:19)

q(z)2

.

k1(z) =

1
z

+

z

2(cid:16)ln

z
2

+ const.(cid:17) +

z3

16(cid:16)ln

z
2

+ const.(cid:17) .

so we have

if (z) =

1

(2)2(cid:18) 1

|z|2 + o(z0)(cid:19) .

12

(39)

(40)

(41)

the scaling degree is the inmum of all  for which the following equation holds for
all test functions (z):

therefore we obtain

lim

0z if (z) (z)dz = 0.

sd (if (x1  x2)) = 2.

(42)

(43)

to calculate the scaling degree of (if (x1  x2))4k we have to interpret it as an
restriction of the welldened tensor product

(if (y1)) (if (y2))  . . .  (if (y4k))

to the diagonal y1 = . . . = y4k. with the microlocal scaling degree we obtain

sd(cid:16)(if (x1  x2))4k(cid:17) = 8  2k.

at x1 = x2 the products of feynman propagators have the singular order

sing ord(cid:16)(if (x1  x2))4k(cid:17) = 4  2k.

4.4 extension of distributions

(44)

(45)

(46)

in momentum space integrals of diagrams with negative degree of divergence are
nite in euclidean calculations. to give also divergent diagrams a sense one has to
renormalize them, and this procedure is not unique. correspondingly we have the
following two theorems in position space, which are proved in [brfr] on curved space
times. the rst one states that the extension of a distribution of negative singular
order exists and is unique, the proof can be already found in [fre]:

theorem 4.1 if t0 (x1, . . . , xn)  d(cid:0)r4n \ 0(cid:1) has singular order  < 0 at the origin,
then a unique t (x1, . . . , xn)  d(cid:0)r4n(cid:1) exists with the same singular order at 0 and

t0 () = t ()

(47)

   d(cid:0)r4n \ 0(cid:1) .

distributions with zero or positive singular order  can be extended, but the extension
is not unique. we rst remark that they are only dened on test functions vanishing
sufciently fast at 0:

 > sing ord t0 =   0



13

t0  d

(cid:0)r4n(cid:1)

(48)

with

d(cid:0)r4n(cid:1) = (cid:8)  d(r4n) | d (0) = 0 for all multiindices

 = (1, . . . , n) with ||  } .

(49)

theorem 4.2 for all t0 (x1, . . . , xn)  d

(cid:0)r4n(cid:1) with sing ord t0 = , 0   < , at 0
exist numerical distributions t  d(cid:0)r4n(cid:1) with the same singular order  at 0 and
   d(cid:0)r4n(cid:1) .

in [brfr] this is proved on curved space times.
to construct extensions of distributions with positive singular order, a projection op-
erator on testfunctions is used.

t0 () = t ()

(50)

denition 4.4 with

0 (cid:0)r4(cid:1) fullling w(0) = 1 and dw(xi) = 0 for all multiindices 

we dene a projection operator on testfunctions of the order  in x1 . . . xk for each
function w(xi)  c
with 0 < ||   and i = 0 for all i > k.

||xi=0 i>k

x
!

w (k) is a modied taylor subtraction operator in k variables of the testfunctions.
since the function w has compact support, the result is a function with compact sup-
port, and vanishes up to the order  in 0. therefore the singular distribution t0 (x)
with singular order  is dened on all w (n) (, w, x)  (x) with x = (x1, . . . xn).
the following construction of the extension of a numerical distribution t0 with
sing ord t0 =  fullls (50):

< t(x), (x) > = < t0(x), w (n) (, w, x)) (x) > +

+ x||

(1)||c

!

< (x), (x) > .

(51)

the free constants c express the ambiguity in the extension of the distribution,
which remains after the function w(x) in the w -operator is xed, it holds

14

< t, wx >= c

for ||  .

(52)

the form of the c can be further restricted by demanding the invariance of the distri-
bution t under symmetry operations, the lorentz invariance for instance. the most
simple choice of the c would be c = 0. but we will see that this choice is incompati-
ble with lorentz invariance for || > 1. another choice of the c leads to the form of
bphz subtraction at momentum q in momentum space. the explicit form of these c
is given in [scha]. naturally this choice of the c for q 6= 0 is again incompatible with
the lorentz invariance for || > 1.

4.5 the lorentz invariant extension in scalar theories

it is possible to determine the free constants c of an extension, so that the result
is a lorentz invariant distribution. in [brpipr] the main idea of the calculation is
introduced and an explicit result is obtained for scalar distributions in one variable.
a further development of the techniques yields an inductive formula for a lorentz
invariant extension of an arbitrary distribution [pra]. in our calculations of the sec-
ond and third order of the s-matrix in 4-theory we only need the results of [brpipr],
which are repeated here.
we use the notation

b(1...n) =

1

n! xsn

b(1)...(n)

(53)

for the total symmetric part of the tensor b. with the following abbreviations for
n  n,

and

the symmetric part of c is given by

(56)

15

this result is unique up to lorentz invariant terms. in the calculations of the next
section we need the coefcients c() for || = 0 and || = 2. in the case || = 0 all
choices of c are lorentz invariant, and we set c = 0. for || = 2 we have

c(12) = 

1

4dt0, x1x2xw  x2x(1 2)we .

in 4-theory we want to renormalize diagrams with 2 and 4 external legs, therefore
we have sing ord t  2, and in this case we obtain by partial integration

(57)

(58)

c(12) = 

1

4d(2 x2x1)t0  x1x2xt0, we .

the numerical distributions are products of feynman propagators and depend only
on x2:

therefore we have

t0 = 2x(t0)

c12 = (cid:10)x1x2t0, w(cid:11) 
= (cid:28)t0, (x1 x2

x2g12)w(cid:29) .

(59)

(60)

in the following calculations only terms even in the variables contribute. it follows
that the lorentz invariant extension of a distribution of singular order 2 according to
(51) has the form

ht, i = (cid:28)t0, (x)  w(x)(0) 

w(x)

8

x2(0)(cid:29) .

(61)

4.6 properties of the w -operator

1. as a projection operator, w (k) has the following properties:

w (k)2 = w (k).
for n  l  m,   , the following relation holds:

w (l)(cid:0), w, (x1, . . . , xl)(cid:1) w (m) (, w, (x1, . . . , xm))  (x1, . . . , xn) =

w (m) (, w, (x1, . . . , xm))  (x1, . . . , xn) .

(62)

16

2. the renormalization scale

characteristic for every renormalization procedure is the occurence of a mass
in the extension of the t -products the w -
scale, the renormalization scale.
operation depends on a function w(x). since the argument of this function
should be dimensionless, it depends implicitly on a mass scale: w = w(mx).
the shape of the function w describes the subtraction procedure, in the region
of w = 1 the subtraction is the full taylor subtraction, whereas nothing is sub-
tracted outside the support of w.

varying the mass scale m with xed w, we change the support region of the
function w and regulate in this way the subtraction procedure. in the limit
m  0 we have w(mx)  1 and the taylor subtraction acts everywhere, whereas
in the limit m   the support of w(mx) shrinks to the origin and we subtract
only at this point.

in the following, we continue to write w(x), and only if we need the dependence
on the mass scale, we will write this function as w(mx).

a variation of the mass scale yields

w((m + m)z)  w(mz) = m


m

w(mz) = mzw.

(63)

5 renormalization of the s-matrix in 4-theory

5.1 introduction

in this section the second and third order of the s-matrix in 4-theory are renormal-
ized using the formalism developped in the previous section. already in second order
we will see that the operators n of theorem (3.1) consist only of linear combinations
of :  :, : 2 : and : 4 :. in the third order calculation it will become clear how
the subtraction of subdivergences works, and that the result is indeed independent
of the partition of unity used in the inductive construction. before starting the calcu-
lations it is useful to make some remarks. we will have to work with expressions of
the typical form

z duz dx t0(u) (w (, w, u) a(x, u)g(x, u)) ,

(64)

where t0(u) is the numerical distribution with singular order , g is a testfunction
with compact support and a is a wick product of elds at x and u. with u and x
we denote a tupel of coordinates (u1, . . . un) resp. (x1, . . . xn). we always assume that
the function w(u) of the w -operation is even in all components of u
i for all i. in the
calculations we use the following facts:

1. if the distributions t0 are even in all u

i , all odd terms in the taylor subtraction

of w will vanish due to the integration over u.

17

2. to make the extension lorentz invariant, we use the form (56) respectively (61)
of the subtraction. here again the contributions of the coefcients c with ||
odd vanish, if t0 is even in the u
i .

3. for   1 there appear terms with derivatives of g in the taylor subtraction.
these terms vanish in the adiabatic limit. because the limit exists in massive
4-theory in the strong sense, we omit them from the beginning.

4. in [d ut] it is shown that the adiabatic limit of vacuum diagrams only exists for
a special choice of the c. this choice is lorentz invariant, and the contributions
of the vacuum diagrams vanish in the adiabatic limit, too.

we denote with ()r the extension of a numerical distribution and with ()e the exten-
sion of a tm-product to the total diagonal dm.

5.2 renormalization of the second order

the second order term in the s-matrix has the form

s(2) (g) =

= 

1

2

2(cid:18) i
4! (cid:19)2z d4x1z d4x2 t2(cid:0)4 (x1) 4 (x2)(cid:1) g (x1) g (x2)

: k (x1) k (x2) : g (x1) g (x2) .

4xk=0(cid:18) 4

k (cid:19)(cid:18) 4

with the singular orders (46) of the feynman propagators we obtain nontrivial con-
tributions of the extension from terms with k = 0, 1, 2.

1. k = 0 yields a vacuum diagram. its contribution vanishes in the adiabatic limit.

2. for k = 1 we have

s(2)
(k=1) (g) = 

(61)
= 

3. for k = 2 we obtain

962

2!(4!)2z d4x1z d4x2 (if (x1  x2))3
12z d4vz d4u (if (u))3h: (u + v)(v) : g(u + v)g(v)

(65)

(66)

(67)

remark: the individual terms in the square brackets are not dened, only their
sum is convergent and welldened. the result is dependent on the function w(x).
we use this dependence to read off the form of the nite renormalizations 2: if we
choose another t -product, only the function w(x) will differ. the difference of two
w-functions has no support at 0 and gives a welldened contribution. denoting with
t the renormalization at the scale m + m and with t the renormalization at m we
obtain with (63):

2 = (cid:16)s(2)

t

 s(2)

t (cid:17) =

a(2) =

12z d4u (if (u))3 m u(w)
96z d4u (if (u))3 m u (w)u2
16z d4u (if (u))2 m u(w).

2

b(2) = 

c (2) = +

at this stage we are able to see how the theoretically predicted form of the higher n
is realized in the calculations. n is the difference in the supercial renormalization
of diagrams with four and two external legs. diagrams with four external legs are
supercial logarithmic divergent and of the form

z duz dv t0(v, u)w (0, w, u) :  (l1(u, v))  (l2(u, v))  (l3(u, v))  (l4(u, v)) :

g (l5(u, v)) . . . g (ln+4(u, v))

(70)

where u = (u1, . . . , un1) are the difference variables and li, i = 1, . . . , n + 4 are linear
combinations of v and the ui of the form li(v, u) = v + aiui with ai  r. varying the
mass scale in w we obtain only the following contribution

z dv c (n) : 4(v) : gn(v).

(71)

diagrams with two external legs are quadratic divergent and of the form

z duz dv t0(v, u)w (2, w, u) :  (l1(u, v))  (l2(u, v)) : g (l3(u, v)) . . . g (ln+2(u, v)) .

(72)

varying the mass scale in the w -operation yields the following contributions:

19

z dv(cid:16)a(n) : 2(v) : +b

(n) : (v)(v)(cid:17) gn(v).

by partial integration we obtain the contribution

z dv b(n) : (v)(v) : gn(v)

(73)

(74)

because the contributions with derivatives of g vanish in the adiabatic limit. finite
renormalizations in all orders in 4-theory consist only of shifts in the coupling con-
stant, in masslike terms and kinetic terms of lint, whose coefcients a(n), b(n) and
c (n) have to be determined in the calculations.

5.3 renormalization of the third order

there are two kinds of w -operations in the calculation, namely taylor subtractions in
one and two variables corresponding to the renormalization of supercial divergences
and subdivergences. in the subtraction in one variable u we use the testfunction w(u)
as before. the testfunction of the w -operator in two variables u and v is chosen to
be w(u) w(v) w(u + v), where w is a testfunction in one variable. since u and v are
difference variables, the function is symmetric in all coordinates.
we now list the 14 topological different diagrams occuring in the sum with their val-
ues of i, j1 and j2. furthermore the singular orders of the whole diagram (x1, x2, x3)
and of the subdiagrams, (xi, xj) consisting only of the vertices xi and xj are listed.
n is the number of all different diagrams in the sum with the same topological struc-
ture.

the contributions of the diagrams 1 and 7 vanish in the adiabatic limit.
diagrams 2, 3 and 4 are supercial logarithmic divergent, they have four external
legs and contribute to the renormalization of the coupling constant. the calculation
of diagram 2 is given in the appendix. here we list only the results, weightened with

the last three diagrams are not dependent on w and yield no contribution to 3.
now we are able to see how the independence of the partition of unity proved in [brfr]
is realized in the previous calculations. we show that the result is independent of the
fi in each order n. we set j = {1, . . . , n}. all diagrams with n vertices v1, . . . , vn
yield contributions to

we take the contribution to a special diagram  and show that it is independent of

w1 is the w -operator in the |i|  1 difference variables belonging to the coordinates

(90)

they are independent of the partition of unity, too. the same argument holds for the
subtractions only in coordinates belonging to i c. subtractions of w1 and w2 together
are made in the partitions belonging to fi and fi c, and with

fi + fi c(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12){(x1,... ,xn)|xi=xj  i,ji, xk=xl  k,li c}

= 1

(91)

they are independent of the partition of unity, too.
the independence of the partition of unity is therefore a consequence of the fact that
the taylor subtractions of the subdivergences act on the partition of unity in (87).

5.4 the normalization conditions

we have seen how renormalization works in the epstein glaser formalism in 4-
theory. to come back to a more theoretical formulation we present the normalization
conditions for 4-theory. some of them are an abstract formulation of techniques used
in the previous calculations. the normalization conditions, introduced in [d ufr] and
extended in [boa], restrict the ambiguities in the renormalization. we repeat these
conditions in the more simple form tting to 4-theory:

 condition n1 demands the lorentz covariance of the t -products, it is described

in [brpipr] and [pra] how to realize it in the extension procedure.

 condition n2 gives the form of the adjoint of t on d and makes sure that the

s-matrix is unitary:

tn(w1(x1), . . . wn(xn))+ = xp p artj

(1)|p |+nypp

tn(cid:0)wi(xi)+, i  p(cid:1) ,

where the sum is over the ordered partitions of j.

 it is shown in [boa] that condition n3 is equivalent to the wick expansion of

the timeordered products:

[tn (w1(x1), . . . , wn(xn)) ,  (y)] =

=

nxk=1

i(xk  y)tn(cid:18)w1(x1), . . .

wk


(xk), . . . wn(xn)(cid:19)

 wi  p,

(92)

27

where i is the commutator function i (x  y) = [t ((x)) , t ((y))]. the
derivative is implicitly dened by

[a(x), (y)] = if (x  y)

a


(x).

for example we nd in 4-theory




n(y) = nn1(y).

 condition n4 has the form

(cid:0)y + m2(cid:1) tn+1 (w1(x1), . . . , wn(xn), (y)) =

= i

tn(cid:18)w1(x1), . . .

nxk=1

wk


(xk), . . . wn(xn)(cid:19) (xk  y)

(93)

(94)

(95)

where wi  p and  is a generator of p.
we now show that in 4-theory the dyson schwinger equations are a con-
sequence of n4. with the gell mann low formula the greens functions
gi (x1, . . . xn) have the form

in

n=0

n!r dy1 . . .r dyn(cid:0) 
4!(cid:1)n
4(y1) . . . 4(yn)g(y1) . . . g(yn)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 0e

4(y1) . . . 4(yn)g(y1) . . . g(yn)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 0e

n!r dy1 . . .r dyn(cid:0) 
4!(cid:1)n

.(96)

in

n=0

d0(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t (x1) . . . (xi)p

d0(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)tp
(cid:0)z + m2(cid:1) gi (x1, . . . xi1, z) =

so we obtain with n4 and (94)

i1xk=1

= i

(xk  z)gi2 (x1, . . . xk . . . xi1) +

g(z)

6

gi+2 (x1, . . . xi1, z, z, z)

(97)

and these are the dyson schwinger equations [riv]. with gi+2 (x1, . . . xi1, z, z, z)
we mean the vacuum expectation value of the eldproduct (x1). . . (xi1)3(z).

in the derivation of the action principle it turns out that these conditions are not
sufcient. for the treatment of the free part of the lagrangian we need an extension
of n4:

28

tn+1(cid:0)w1(x1), . . . wn(xn), v (z)(cid:0)z + m2(cid:1) (z)(cid:1) =

=

tn(cid:18)w1(x1), . . . v

nxk=1

wk


(xk), . . . wn(xn)(cid:19) i(xk  z).

(98)

this condition provides for the counting properties of insertions proportional to l0
and it makes sure that the part of the action principle concerning changes in l0 is
valid. in appendix (a) we show that it is compatible with condition n3.

6 the action principle

6.1 main theorem of perturbative renormalization theory

the procedure of renormalization depends on the renormalization scale, and we can
say that two t -products t and t are renormalizations at different scales m, although
their scale dependence is not obvious in the abstract formulation of section 3. given
two renormalization prescriptions t and t belonging to different scales m one can
pass from one to another by a suitable change of the scale dependent quantities in the
lagrangian. this is the content of the main theorem of perturbative renormalization
theory, which is proved in [post] in the framework of causal perturbation theory.
in this section we derive the explicit form of the changes of parameters in the la-
grangian compensating a change of renormalization t  t .
in the following calculations we use the abbreviations

v := iz v (x)g(x)dx,

ek(v)

:=

(i)n

n! z d4x1 . . .z d4xn v (x1) . . . v (xn)g(x1) . . . g(xn).

xn=k

then the s-matrix reads, for example,

s = t e0(v) =

(i)n

n! z d4x1 . . .z d4xn tn (v (x1) . . . v (xn)) g(x1) . . . g(xn),

(99)

xn=0

and

ek(v) =

xn=k

(i)n

n! z d4x1 . . .z d4xn n (v (x1) . . . v (xn)) g(x1) . . . g(xn).

(100)

the following theorem describes how to absorb a change in the renormalization pre-
scription t  t in a change v  vr of the physical parameters in the lagrangian:

29

theorem 6.1 an s-matrix renormalized according to t can be expressed by an s-
matrix renormalized according to t in the following way:

t e0(v) = t e0(e1(v)) =: t e0(vr).

remark: from this we can easily derive the following recursion relation:

e2(v) = t e2(v)  t e2(v + e2(v)).

proof: we prove the theorem in the following calculation:

(101)

(102)

here we sum over all partitions of the set j = {1, . . . , n}. now we take a xed
partition p and denote with ni the number of elements o of p with |o| = i.

i=1 ini is true with k  n. there are

in renormalizable theories, vr = e1(v) consists only of linear combinations of
the eld combinations in the original lagrangian. in scalar 4 -theory e1(v) is
a linear combination of the monomials , 2 and 4. the coefcients depend
on the renormalization conditions and this dependence is described by the callan-
symanzik equations and the renormalization group equations. the most elegant
way to derive them uses the action principle [low]. at this stage it is not clear in
the epstein glaser formalism that a contribution of the form 2 to e1(v ) can be
interpreted as a shift in the mass.

6.2 insertions

to derive the action principle we need the notion of an insertion.

denition 6.1 an insertion of degree a of a local monomial j(x) of free elds in a

t -product t(cid:16)qjj v (xj)(cid:17) is dened by the following expression:

i(cid:16)j(x)(a), t(cid:16)qjj v (xj)(cid:17)(cid:17) := t (a)(cid:16)qjj v (xj)j(x)(cid:17) ,

where t (a) means that the vertex belonging to j is treated in the extension procedure
dening t as a vertex of mass dimension a.

likewise an insertion of degree a of an integrated local monomial j =r j(x)g(x)dx in
a t -product t(cid:16)qjj v (xj)(cid:17) is dened by the following expression

i(j(a), t(cid:16)qjj v (xj)(cid:17))

:= z d4x t (a)(cid:16)qjj v (xj)j(x)(cid:17) g(x).

remark: if the degree a of the insertion corresponds to its mass dimension m it
in the case a > m all diagrams containing the vertex
is called a soft insertion.
of the insertion are oversubtracted and we have a hard insertion. the relation of
two insertions of the same wick monomial with different degrees is given by the
zimmermann identities derived in the next section.
the behaviour of an insertion under a change of renormalization, j  jr, is given by
the following theorem.

(107)

(108)

31

theorem 6.2 an insertion in the s-matrix renormalized according to t can be ex-
pressed as an insertion in the s-matrix renormalized according to t in the following
way:

t (e0(v)j) = t (e0(vr)(e0(v)j))

=: t (e0(vr)jr) .

(109)

remark: after some calculation we obtain from this the recursion relation

(e1(v)j) = t (e1(v)j)  t (e1(vr)j)  t (e1(vr)(e1(v)j)) .

(110)

proof: we know from theorem (6.1)

with w = v + j with a massless parameter  we obtain

t e0(w) = t e0(e1(w)).

(111)

t (e0(v)j) =








e0(w)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0(cid:19)
t(cid:18) 
t e0(w)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0
e0 (e1(v + j))(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0(cid:19)
= t(cid:18) 

= t (e0(e1(v))(e0(v)j)) .

=

(111)

(112)

since  is massless the differentiation does not change the mass dimension of the
argument of the t -product. therefore we can interchange differentiation and renor-
malization. (cid:4)
three further properties of insertions are interesting:

 interacting elds have up to a factor s1 the form of an insertion:

aintl(x) =



h(x)

st (l)1st (l + ha)|h=0

= st (l)1i (a(x), st (l)) .

(113)

 insertions in the s-matrix of integrated monomials aj occuring in the interac-
tion act as counting operators of vertices of the kind aj [low]. assume that the
interacting lagrangian consists of various monomials ai, then an insertion of
aj into the s-matrix effects that every diagram  is weighted with the number
c
i of its vertices aj:

i(aj, s) = x

c
j s.

32

(114)

 an insertion of degree 4 proportional to the free lagrangian

i(cid:18) i

2 (cid:0)(x)(x)  m22(x)(cid:1)(4)

, s(cid:19)

(115)

counts the lines of a diagram. the proof consists of an explicit calculation us-
ing some results of section (4), especially the wick expansion of time ordered
products (which is equivalent to n3) and the normalization condition n4 (98).
we only give the main arguments of the calculation. in other theories the same
arguments can be used.

there are three kinds of diagrams contributing to (115), namely diagrams with
both, one or no (x) contracted with the elds of s.

1. diagrams with uncontracted (x) yield no contribution, because they have

the form

z d4xz d4u1 . . .z d4un t(u1, . . . un)
:(cid:0)(x)(x)  m22(x)(cid:1)
}
|

{z

=0

i
2

a(u1, . . . un) : g(u1) . . . g(un),

(116)

where ui are the arguments of the elds in the s-matrix, t is the numerical
distribution and a is a product of elds.

2. diagrams in which one (x) of the insertion is contracted are weightened
with the number of their external legs. to show this we regard a diagram
with n external legs at u1. we obtain from the contraction (after partial
integration) the contribution

(cid:0)x + m2(cid:1) if (x  u1) = i(x  u1),

(117)

furthermore a wick polynomial of the form : (x)n1(u1) . . . : and the com-
binatorical factor 2n, together with the factor i
2 . putting these things
together we obtain n times the original diagram.

3. because of n4 we have to contract the elds of the insertions only with
elds at different points. we now contract in a diagram  with (n  1) lines
between the vertices at ui and uj both (x) of the insertion with elds at ui
and uj. then we obtain a diagram with n lines between the vertices at ui
and uj. assume that  has ei external legs at ui and ej external legs at uj.
we obtain from the contraction in analogy to the previous arguments the
contributions

 if (x  ui)(cid:0)x + m2(cid:1) if (x  uj) = if (x  ui)i(x  uj),

33

(118)

a wick polynomial of the form : ei1(y)ej 1(z) . . . :, the factor i
2 and the
combinatorical factor 2e1e2. the contraction of the n  1 lines of  in the
s-matrix yields a factor

(cid:18) e1 + n  1

n  1

(cid:19)(cid:18) e2 + n  1

n  1

(cid:19) (n  1)!.

(119)

the resulting factor of this diagram is

2e1e2

(e1 + n  1)!(e2 + n  1)!

e1!e2!(n  1)!

= 2n(cid:18) e1 + n  1

n

= 2nk1

(cid:19)(cid:18) e2 + n  1

n

(cid:19) n!

where k1 is the combinatorical factor of the same diagram with n lines
between ui and uj in the s-matrix.

from the point of view of the counting properties of insertions the free part of
the lagrangian behaves like an interacting lagrangian of subtraction degree 4
of the same form.

6.3 zimmermann identities

the zimmermann identities [zim] are relations of insertions of different degrees.
comparing the two insertions

i(cid:16)j(x)(a), t(cid:16)qjj v (xj)(cid:17)(cid:17) = t(cid:16)qjj v (xj)j(x)(cid:17) ,
i(cid:16)j(x)(b), t(cid:16)qjj v (xj)(cid:17)(cid:17) = t (cid:16)qjj v (xj)j(x)(cid:17)

(120)

we obtain the operatorvalued distribution  mediating between the two t -products.
using the properties

 (v (xi)) = v (xi),

 (j(x)) = j(x),

v (xi)! = 0 for |j| > 1

 yij

(121)

we obtain with (18) the zimmermann identities

t  j(y)yij

v (xi)!
v (xi)! = t j(y)yij
tyl6ok
v (xl)ylok
+ xokj

ok6=

v (xl)j(y) .

(122)

34

in the special case of insertions in the s-matrix this formula simplies to

t (e0(v)j(x))

(109)
= t (e0(v)(e0(v)j(x)))
= t (e0(v)j(x)) + t (e0(v)(e1(v)j(x))).

(123)

6.4 the action principle

the action principle describes the effects of a change of parameters of a theory [sib].
according to the main theorem (6.1) a change of the renormalization t can be ab-
sorbed by nite counterterms shifting the quantities in the lagrangian. therefore
we can assume without loss of generality that the t -product is xed. a change of a
parameter p  p + p can cause changes in the free lagrangian and in the interaction
part of the lagrangian:

l0  l0 + l0
v  v + v

(124)

we now prove the action principle stating that a change of the s-matrix caused by a
variation of a parameter p can be expressed by an insertion in the s-matrix:

t (e0(v)) = t e0(v) (cid:18) v
p(cid:19)(4)

+(cid:18) l0

p (cid:19)(4)!! .


p

where l0 has the form

l0 =

i

2 (cid:0)(z)(z)  m2(z)2(cid:1) .

(125)

(126)

the elds  are independent of p because we have separated the eld strength in the
numerical factor z(p).
the degree of the subtractions on both sides of (125) have to be the same. since the
vertices on the left hand side have mass dimension 4, the insertions on the right hand
side have to be of degree 4, too. we use (98).
the appearance of the rst term on the right hand side of (125) resulting from the
variation of v follows from a trivial differentiation of e0(v).
now let v be independent of p. then only the lines in a diagram will change if we
vary p. a variation of l0 yields

l0
p

=

i

p(cid:0)(z)(z)  m2(z)2(cid:1)

into the s-matrix and show that the resulting diagrams are
the original diagrams of the s-matrix, in which the lines are derivated by p. only the
main arguments of the calculation are presented here.

we now insert(cid:16) l0
p (cid:17)(4)
because of(cid:0) + m2(cid:1) (z) = 0 we obtain

(cid:18) 

p

m2(cid:19) (z) +(cid:0) + m2(cid:1)(cid:18) 

p

z(cid:19) = 0.

the insertion of l0

p of degree 4 into the s-matrix yields

(128)

(129)

 no contribution, if the elds of l0

p are not contracted:

 a derivation of the external legs at y if  of the insertion is contracted with (y)

of e0(v):

we take a diagram with n external legs at y and regard all contributions of the
insertion with one contracted (x). from (128) we know

where we denote the contraction of the  with the bracket. therefore the con-
tributions of the contraction of 
p and the
contribution of the contractions of the third term of l0

p z(x) of the rst two terms of l0

p cancel.

from the contraction of z(x) of the rst two contributions of l0

p we obtain

1. a combinatorical factor n

2. the factor i
3. the expression ( + m2)if (x  y) = i(x  y)

4. the wick product :(cid:16) 

p z(x)(cid:17) (z)n1 (y) :

this yields together the derivation of an external leg:

 a derivation of the internal lines of the diagrams if the insertion is fully con-

tracted:

because of n4 we only have to consider terms where the elds of the insertion
are contracted with elds at different points.

because of (128) we only have to consider the fully contracted insertion of

i

p

z(x)(cid:19)(cid:0)x + m2(cid:1) (z(x)).

(132)

we regard the completely contracted insertion of (132) in a diagram  of the
s-matrix with n  1 lines between y and z. it yields the contribution

nk1 (if (z  y))n1(cid:18) 

p

if (x  z)(cid:19) (x  y)t0 : a :,

(133)

where t0 and a are the remaining part of the numerical distribution and the
remaining external elds belonging to the diagram and k1 is the combinatorical
factor belonging to the same diagram with n lines between y and z in the s-
matrix. therefore the completely contracted insertion yields the derivation of
the internal lines of a diagram:


p

(if (x  y))n = n(cid:18) 

p

if (x  y)(cid:19) (if (x  y))n1 .

(134)

summing up all contributions of all possible contractions yields the action principle.
(cid:4)
now we can interpret the mass terms m(g)2 of the nite renormalizations in the
interaction part of the lagrangian as shifts in the mass of l0, because the changes of
a mass in l0 have the same effects as the changes of mass terms in v .

7 summary and outlook

we have derived the structure of nite renormalizations in the epstein glaser formal-
ism. then it was easy to derive the form of the s-matrix after a nite renormalization
and the zimmermann identities.
the s-matrix in 4-theory was renormalized up to the third order. the result de-
pends on the testfunction w used in the renormalization, and nite counterterms
can be read off. comparing this procedure with other renormalizations in momen-
tum space, we can say that epstein glaser renormalization is better suited for the
treatment of diagrams with few vertices and many loops, whereas momentum space
renormalization has advantages in the renormalization of diagrams with many ver-
tices and few loops.

37

finally we have proved the action principle for changes of parameters and external
elds.
there are still many open questions: the action principle for changes of elds has to
be derived and a fully translation of the derivation of the callan symanzik equations
as in [low] has to be worked out. one has to check further if there appear problems
in the translation of these methods on curved space times.

a compatibility of n3 and the extended version of n4

the elements of p are monomials in the classical elds and their derivatives. a
derivation of an element w of p is a submonomial of w , this means that it is of lower
order in the elds as w .
knowing the t -products involving all submonomials of w1, . . . wn the t -product of
w1, . . . wn is determined up to a c-number by condition n3 [boa]. therefore we can
construct the t -products inductively using n3.
we now assume that condition n3 and the extended version of n4 hold for
all t -products with submonomials of w1, . . . wn, a. we claim that n4 holds for

tn+1(cid:0)w1, . . . , wn, a( + m2)(cid:1), and have to show that this assumption does not con-

tradict the determination of this t -product by n3. therefore we have to show that
the following equation holds:

(cid:2)tn+1(cid:0)w1, . . . , wn, a(y)(cid:0)y + m2(cid:1) (y)(cid:1) , (z)(cid:3)

wk


(xk), . . . wn(cid:19) , (z)(cid:21) i(xk  y).

= i

nxk=1(cid:20)tn(cid:18)w1, . . . a

using n3 the terms in the second line have the form

i

nxk=1

j6=k

i(xj  z)t(cid:18)w1, . . . a
(cid:26) nxj=1
+i(xk  z)t(cid:18)w1 . . . a
+i(xk  z)t(cid:18)w1 . . .

from the rst line we obtain with n3 two contributions:

i(xj  z)t(cid:18)w1, . . .

(xj), . . . wn, a(y)(cid:0)y + m2(cid:1) (y)(cid:19)

+i(y  z)t(cid:18)w1, . . . wn,

(137)

according to the extended version of n4 applied to the t -products of submonomials,
the terms of (136) and (137) are the same.

we remark that the form of the taylor subtraction of the subdivergence depends of
the choice of coordinates in (139), but the result is independent of this choice due to
the integration over them.
