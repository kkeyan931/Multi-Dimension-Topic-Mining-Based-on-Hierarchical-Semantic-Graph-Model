a new topological model is proposed in three dimensions as an extension of the bf-model. it
is a three-dimensional counterpart of the two-dimensional model introduced by chamseddine and
wyler ten years ago. the bfk-model, as we shall call it, shows to be quantum scale invariant at all
orders in perturbation theory. the proof of its full niteness is given in the framework of algebraic
renormalization.

i. introduction.

the bf-models have been widely investigated since the middle of the eighties [112], specially the two-dimensional
bf-model in connection with topological quantum gravity [14]. the properties of ultraviolet and infrared perturbative
niteness of the two-dimensional bf-model have been rigorously proved in the framework of algebraic renormalization
[5], there the authors make use of an additional symmetry peculiar to topological models in the landau gauge, called
vector-supersymmetry [6,1315]. as a natural extension of the two-dimensional case, it has been proposed in [3] an
extended bf-model, as a gauge theory for topological quantum gravity, which accommodates a topological matter
coupling. later, the authors of [7] have been shown that the model proposed in [3] is still ultraviolet and infrared nite
at all orders in perturbation theory by using the same approach as those of [5] have done to the pure two-dimensional
bf-model.

at the level of perturbation theory, a general classication of all possible anomalies and invariant counterterms
of bf-models in any space-time dimension has been done in [8]. the feature of the independence on the gauge
coupling of those models was pointed out by the authors of [9]. moreover, it has been shown that d-dimensional
bf-yang-mills-models, a bf formulation of the yang-mills theory, are cohomologically equivalent to yang-mills [10].
three-dimensional bf-yang-mills theory, both gaussian and extended, have been algebraically quantized by the
authors of [11], where the proof of their exact quantum scale invariance at all orders in perturbation theory have been
given in [12]. note: after the completion of this work we became aware of ref. [16], where a dimensional reduction `a la
scherk of the gaussian four-dimensional abelian version of the bf-yang-mills-model is performed to three dimensions
leading to a model similar to ours, there its spectrum is analyzed in details as well.

our purpose in this letter is to present a rigorous proof on the niteness of an extended version of the bf-model
in three dimensions introduced here. such a model, we shall call bfk-model, is a three-dimensional counterpart of
that model in two dimensions proposed by chamseddine and wyler [3]. the proof is performed by using the method
of algebraic renormalization [6], which is independent of any particular regularization scheme. the letter is organized
as follows. the bfk-model and its symmetries are introduced in section ii. in section iii, the proof on the full
niteness at all orders in perturbation theory is sketched and at the end the conclusions are drawn. here in this letter
we summarize the main results and all details shall be reported elsewhere in a more complete paper [17]. it is now
under investigation the classication of all possible counterterms and anomalies of the d-dimensional bfk-model [18]
by following the same approach of [8].

ii. the bfk-model in d = 3 and its symmetries

a. the classical action

the classical action of the bfk-model in d = 3 is given by

bfk

inv =

trz d3x  {bf + kd} ,

1
2

(1)

where b is a vector eld, k is a rank-2 antisymmetric tensor and  is a scalar. the second piece of the action (1)
can be seen as a topological matter coupling, where the matter elds k and  lie in the adjoint representation of
the gauge group. in two dimensions similar topological matter term was proposed by chamseddine and wyler [3].
any eld, , is to be assumed as lie algebra valued, in such a way that

where the matrices  are the generators of the gauge group1 and obey

  aa ,

[a, b] = fabcc and tr(ab) =

1
2

ab .

the eld strength, f , is dened as

and the covariant derivative reads

f = a  a + [a, a ] ,

d =  + [a, ] .

b. gauge symmetries

the action (1) possesses two symmetries:

1. the standard gauge symmetry

2. the topological symmetry

a = d  ( + [a, ]) , b = [, b] ,
k = [, k] and  = [, ] .

a = 0 , b = (d + [, ]) ,
k = (d  d) and  = 0 .

c. brs symmetry

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

the corresponding brs transformations of the elds, a, b, k and , stemming from the symmetries (6) and

(7), are given by2

1the gauge group is considered as a general compact one.
2the commutators are assumed to be graded, namely, [g1
g2, are the faddeev-popov charges () carried by g1

1 , g2
1 and g2

1 g2

2 ]  g1
2 , respectively.

2 g1

1 , where the upper indices, g1 and

2

sa = dc  (c + [a, c]) , sb = db1 + [, b1
sk = (db1

) + [c, k] , s = [c, ] and sc = c2 ,

  db1

] + [c, b] ,

(8)

where c and b1 are scalar ghosts, and b1
 is a vector ghost, all of them are anticommuting elds with faddeev-popov
charge (ghost number) one. bearing in mind that we have a residual degree of freedom from sk caused by a zero
mode (b1
 = d2), i.e., it is a reducible symmetry, has to be xed, therefore, yielding a ghost b2 for the ghost b1
.
now, xing the zero mode by introducing the ghost for ghost, b2, the remaining brs transformations read

sb1 = [, b2] + [c, b1] , sb1

 = db2 + [c, b1

] and sb2 = [c, b2] .

it should be noticed that the brs operator s is nilpotent up to the eld equations for b and k, since

s2b =

1

2(cid:20)b2, 

called on-shell nilpotency.

d. gauge-xing

the gauge-xing we are considering here is of the landau-type. since we are dealing with a more complex model
than the yang-mills one, face its symmetries, some subtleties arise as their consequence. in order to implement the
gauge-xing we couple the lagrange multiplier elds b, 0, 0 and 1 to

tr ba , tr 0b , tr 0 (k + 0) and tr 1(b1

 + 1) ,

(11)

where the multiplier elds belong to the following brs-doublets:

sc = b , sb = 0 ;

sc1 = 0 , s0 = 0 ;
sc1 = 0 , s0 = 0 ;
sc2 = 1 , s1 = 0 .

(12)

we stress here that for the elds, k and b1
, inhomogeneous gauge conditions (11) have been chosen. in which
concerns the eld k, a gauge condition of the type 0 k would not x completely the gauge, since a residual
degree of freedom is present by 0  0 +  0, therefore, due to this fact an inhomogeneous gauge-xing condition
has to be adopted. since it is an abelian transformation does not demand further ghost elds. besides the condition
on k has introduced a new eld 0, it yields also the consideration of another inhomogeneous gauge condition
associated to b1
in fact, the introduction of 1 is due to cohomological
arguments, so in order to protect the independence of brs-cohomology in those elds introduced by hand, we force
them to belong to a brs-doublet

 by putting into the game the eld 1.

s0 = 1 , s1 = 0 .

(13)

bearing in mind that a neutral faddeev-popov charge action is desired, the elds 0 and 1 have already had their
charges xed3, 0 and 1, respectively.

now, to introduce a brs-trivial gauge-xing compatible with the gauge conditions (11), we add to the action (1)

the following four pieces:

gf = s trz d3x ca , 2
gf = s trz d3x c1(k + 0) and 4

gf = s trz d3x c1b ,

1

3

gf = s trz d3x c2(b1

 + 1) .

(14)

3the dimension (d) and the ghost number () of all elds are displayed in table i.

3

moreover, since those four pieces (14) of the gauge-xing shall break the on-shell nilpotency (10) of the brs operator
s, further modications of the brs transformations are necessary, however, in order to restore the brs invariance an
additional term has to be added to the gauge-xing sector as well. the full modied gauge-xing action,

gf = 1

gf + 2

gf + 3

gf + 4

gf + mod ,

with

reads

mod = trz d3x c1

 [c1, b2] ,

gf = trz d3x (cid:26)ba + 0b + 0 (k + 0) + 1(b1

 + 1) +

+ cdc + c1(db1  [, b1
+ c1[(db1

]  [c, b]  [ c1, b2]) +
  [c, k]  [c1, b2])  1] +

  db1

+ c2(db2 + [c, b1

]) + c1

 [c1, b2](cid:27) ,

where the enlarged brs transformations associated to b and k are given by

sb = db1 + [, b1
sk = (db1
  db1

] + [c, b] + [ c1, b2] ,
) + [c, k] + [c1, b2] .

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

let us now introduce the action in which the nonlinear brs transformations are coupled to the antields (brs

invariant external elds), so as to control the renormalization of those transformations:

ext = trz d3x (cid:26)b

the total classical action for the bfk-model, (0):

(0) = bfk

inv + gf + ext ,

is invariant under the following brs transformations

sb = db1 + [, b1
sk = (db1
  db1

] + [c, b] + [ c1, b2] ,
) + [c, k] + [c1, b2] ,

sa = dc , s = [c, ] , sc = c2 ,

sb1 = [, b2] + [c, b1] , sb1

 = db2 + [c, b1

] , sb2 = [c, b2] ,

sc = b , sb = 0 ; sc1 = 0 , s0 = 0 ;

sc1 = 0 , s0 = 0 ; sc2 = 1 , s1 = 0 ,

s0 = 1 , s1 = 0 .

the brs invariance of the action (20) is expressed through the slavnov-taylor identity

which translates, in a functional way, the invariance of the classical theory under the brs symmetry. it is suitable
to dene, for later use, the linearized slavnov-taylor operator as below

since the bfk-model is a topological model of schwarz type, in the landau gauge, as we are assuming here, a

symmetry called vector-supersymmetry [6,1315] stems:

where its representation by means of a ward operator is given by

w(0) = w

by similar reasons to the existence of a vector-supersymmetry in the bfk-model, a scalar-supersymmetry can be
found:

 l(0) =  l ,

e. gauge conditions, ghost and antighost equations

this subsection is devoted to establish the gauge conditions, ghost and antighost equations, and two others quite

important symmetries in the proof of the exact quantum scale invariance of the bfk-model.

the gauge conditions read

to renormalization.

the rst group of identities involving the slavnov-taylor operator given by (38) are those which yield the conditions
(the well-known wess-zumino consistency condition is one of them) to be satised by the quantum breaking of the
slavnov-taylor identity (22) allowed by the quantum action principle [6].

iii. finiteness

in this section is summarized the results on the study of stability of the classical action under radiative corrections,
the implementation of the slavnov-taylor identity at the quantum level and the conclusion on the niteness of the
bfk-model at all orders in perturbation theory.

in order to check whether the action in the tree-approximation is stable under radiative corrections or not, we

perturb it by an arbitrary integrated local functional c, such that

a. stability

e(0) = (0) + c ,

7

(41)

where  is an innitesimal parameter. the functional c has the same quantum numbers4 (dimension 3, faddeev-

popov charge 0, . . . ) as the classical action, (0), and the deformed action, e(0), must obey in the same way all the

identities (0) does, leading therefore, to the following homogeneous conditions to be fullled by the counterterm, c:

s(0) c = wc =  lc =

c = g2c = gc = c = f c = c = 0 .

c

c
0 =

c

c

(42)

in searching for the most general counterterm satisfying all the constraints listed above, it can be shown [17] that

there is no integrated local polynomial in the elds which survives those requirements, then

c = 0 ,

(43)

meaning that the usual ambiguities due to the renormalization procedure do not appear in the bfk-model. it remains
now to prove the absence of anomalies in order to conclude about the perturbative niteness of the model.

b. anomaly and niteness

at the quantum level the vertex functional, , which coincides with the classical action (20), (0), at order 0 in h,

 = (0) + o(h) ,

(44)

has to satisfy the same constraints as the classical action does. however, according to the quantum action principle
[6] the slavnov-taylor identity (22) gets a quantum breaking

s() =    =  + o(h) ,

(45)

where  is an integrated local functional with ghost number 1 and dimension 3. the absence of anomalies amounts
to show that the slavnov-taylor identity can be implemented at the quantum level at the expenses of a brs-trivial

breaking  = sb(0), called noninvariant counterterm.

the nilpotency identity, ss() = 0, together with

implies the wess-zumino consistency condition for the breaking :

s = s(0) + o(h) ,

beyond that, through the algebra (38),  satises:

s(0)  = 0 ,

w =  l =

(46)

(47)

(48)

the wess-zumino consistency condition (47) constitutes a cohomology problem in the sector of ghost number one.

its solution can always be written as a sum of a trivial cocycle s(0)b(0), where b(0) has ghost number 0, and of

nontrivial elements belonging to the cohomology of s(0) (23) in the sector of ghost number one, a(1):

(49)

although the constraints imposed to  in (47) and (48) show that a(1) = 0 [17], it can be proved quite generally that
in three-dimensions there is no anomaly, since the cohomology in the sector of ghost number 1 is empty up to possible
terms in the abelian ghosts [19]. however, through the arguments of [20] we conclude that the u (1)-ghosts do not
contribute to the anomaly due to their freedom or soft coupling, then the slavnov-taylor identity is implemented at
the quantum level.

in conclusion, the absence of counterterms in the study of stability, as presented in subsection iii a, together with
the result of subsection iii b concerning the absence of anomaly lead to a proof on the niteness of the bfk-model
at all orders in perturbation theory.
