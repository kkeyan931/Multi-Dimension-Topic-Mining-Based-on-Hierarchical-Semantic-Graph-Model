abstract

we analyse the canonical structure of ads3 gravity in terms of the coadjoint

orbits of the virasoro group. there is one subset of orbits, associated to btz

black hole solutions, that can be described by a pair of chiral free elds with

a background charge. there is also a second subset of orbits, associated to

point-particle solutions, that are described by two pairs of chiral free elds

obeying a constraint. all these orbits admit kahler quantization and generate
a hilbert space which, despite of having 0( 0) = 0, does not provide the

right degeneracy to account for the bekenstein-hawking entropy due to the

breakdown of modular invariance. therefore, additional degrees of freedom,

reestablishing modular invariance, are necessarily required to properly account

for the black hole entropy.

introduction

three-dimensional quantum gravity with a negative cosmological constant pro-

vides an interesting example of the general duality relation proposed in [1, 2, 3]

between string theory on anti-de sitter space (ads) times a compact space and

a conformal eld theory (cft) on the boundary.

it was pointed out in [4]

that gravity on ads3 is a two-dimensional cft with a classical central charge
ccl = 3

2 is the cosmological constant.
the physical relevance of 2+1 quantum gravity has recently increased [5] since



g , where g is newtons constant and  1

the near-horizon geometry of black holes arising in string theory can be related

to that of the three-dimensional btz black holes [6]. strominger [5] has pro-

posed an unied treatment to account for the bekenstein-hawking entropy of

all black holes whose near-horizon geometries are locally ads3 without using

supersymmetry or string theory. this includes the black strings studied in [7]

as well as the btz black holes. the observation of [5] is based on cardys for-

mula [8] for the asymptotic density of states of a unitary and modular invariant
two-dimensional cft with central charge c and eigenvalues ( ) of l0( l0)

s = 2s c

as noted in [5] this expression coincides, for ,   c , with the bekenstein-

hawking black hole entropy

(1.4)

the validity of cardys formula (1.1) requires that the lowest eigenvalues (0, 0)
of l0 and l0 vanish, otherwise the asymptotic level density is controlled by the

eective central charge cef f = c  240 [9]. this hidden assumption for the

cardys formula turns out to be very important [10, 11] because it has been

argued [12],using the chern-simons formulation of the theory [13, 14], that the

1

cft at spatial innity for ads3 gravity is liouville theory. however, the anal-

ysis of [12] is not complete since the zero modes and the associated holonomies
are not considered. moreover, the lowest eigenvalues (0, 0) of l0 and l0 are

not zero for normalizable states in liouville theory [15]

0 =

c  1

24

(1.5)

and therefore the central charge in (1.1) should indeed be replaced by cef f = 1.

this implies that the liouville theory does not have enough states to account

for the black hole entropy. although supersymmetry suggests that the mini-
mum eigenvalue of l0( l0) vanishes [10], the super-liouville theory has the same
drawback and fails to give the right degeneracy (cef f = 3

2 ). these diculties
were interpreted in [16] suggesting that gravity represents a thermodynamical

description of the dual cft with the liouville eld emerging as a kind of col-

lective coordinate. it has also been argued [17, 18] that string theory on a ads3

background could correctly account for the bekenstein-hawking entropy. a re-

cent attempt to attack this problem within gravity theory has been proposed

in [19, 20] by extending the asymptotic symmetry algebra with new generators.

the aim of this paper is to approach this problem from an analysis of the

phase space of the theory in terms of the coadjoint orbits of the virasoro group

[21].

2 virasoro orbits and gravity on ads3

to properly dene a gravity theory on ads3 we have to provide boundary

conditions for the elds at innity. one can assume that the physical metric

eld approaches to the ads3 metric

ds2 = (

r2
2 + 1)dt2 + (

r2
2 + 1)1dr2 + r2d2 ,

where  and r are the angular and radial coordinates, as follows

g+ = 

r2
2

+ +(x+, x) + o(

1
r

) ,

g = (x+, x) + o(

1
r

) ,

(2.4)

(2.5)

where x  t

  . these boundary conditions allow a well dened action of
two copies of the virasoro group through space-time dieomorphisms. the

innitesimal dieomorphisms  a(r, t, ) preserving the boundary conditions are

 r = r(+t + + t ) + o(

  = 2t  +

+t + + o(

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

) ,

where the functions t  depend on x (t (r, t, ) = t (x)). by using dif-

feomorphisms which can be regarded as gauge transformations (t  = 0) one

can bring a general metric satisfying the equations of motion

r

g r =

2 g

(2.9)

into the form [22]

ds2 =

2
r2 dr2  r2dx+dx + ++(dx+)2 + (dx)2 + o(

1
r

) .

(2.10)

where (x) are chiral functions. if either ++ = 0 or  = 0, the omitted

corrections vanish. recently [23], it has been obtained an exact general solution,

which can be rewritten as

ds2 =

2
r2 dr2  (rdx 

++

r

dx+)(rdx+ 



r

dx).

(2.11)

a special class of solutions verifying the boundary conditions (2.2-2.5) are the

btz black holes [6]. they correspond to constant functions for ++, :

 = 2g(m   j)

(2.12)

where m is the black hole mass and j the angular momentum.

the physical excitations can be naturally dened by the action of the

would-be gauge dieomorphisms on the topologically inequivalent geometries

to ads3 (2.1). obviously, the geometries obtained by a discrete identication

3

of ads3 cannot be related by dieomorphisms and therefore the physical phase

space m of the theory is the collection of the dieomorphism orbits through the

topologically dierent solutions. we shall now provide a detailed description of

this phase space. to this end we have to know the action of the dieomorphisms

on the solutions (2.10).

the action of the innitesimal dieomorphisms (2.6-2.8) on the functions

 is

t  = 2(t  + 2t )  23

t  .

(2.13)

and the noether charges j[] associated with them are

j[] =

1

16g z d{t +(4++ + 2) + t (4 + 2)} ,

(2.14)

these expressions allow to relate  to the stress tensor  of a confor-
mal eld theory on the sphere:  = 1

4g . with this identication the

transformation law (2.13) for  is

t  = 2(t  + 2t )

expression (2.20) turns out to be equivalent to the coadjoint action ad(f)

. the

of the virasoro group [21] and therefore the contribution of (2.20) to the

4

phase space can be identied with some coadjoint orbit of the virasoro group

dis1/h, where h is the stationary subgroup of the orbit. the most interest-

ing orbits [21] emerge when  are constant, and this is the case in our theory
(see (2.12)). for a generic constant value  = 8gb
0 the subgroup h is
the rotation group s1 and the coadjoint orbit is then dis1/s1. however, for

special values of b
0

0 = n2 ccl
b
48

n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , the stationary subgroup becomes larger

h = dis1/sl(n)(2, r)

(2.21)

(2.22)

where sl(n)(2, r) is generated by l0, ln y ln. since the minimum value of b
0
is given by anti-de sitter space (b

48 ) the relevant orbits of our problem

0 =  ccl

are the following

(2.24)

the sector b

0 < 0 corresponds to classical point-particle solutions [24].

these orbits naturally inherit the symplectic two-form [21, 25, 26]

note that, for convenience, we are still using the group variables to parametrize

the orbits.

the fourier expansion of f

which are similar to the poisson brackets of free bosons. however, it is well-

known that a symplectic structure can always be written, at least locally, in

the standard form  = pi pi  qi. in our case, the natural ansatz for the

darboux elds  is

then, the stress tensor takes the form of improved chiral free elds

(2.33)

(2.34)

so, the subset of orbits b

0 parameters through

(x  2) = (x)  2q4b

(2.35)

we should note that, in case that b+

0 = b

0 (i.e., j = 0), the left and right

moving sectors can be summed up to produce a scalar free eld  = + + 

which, in turn, can be mapped via a backlund transformation into a liouville

eld [27, 28]

l = r ccl

(2.36)

where a = f if + =  = 0 and a = 1

e2f if + =  6= 0, and 2

the backlund transformation denes a proper canonical transformation only if the mon-

odromy of the chiral functions a of the liouville eld is hyperbolic (+ =  6= 0) or

parabolic (+ =  = 0).

(2.38)

this way we recover the results of [12] obtained from the chern-simons gauge

theory by implementing a hamiltonian reduction of two chiral wzw models.

however, the analysis of [12] does not consider the zero modes and, therefore,

cannot see the details of all the virasoro orbits. in fact, only for j = 0 one can

construct a liouville eld from the chiral free elds .

the situation for b

0 < 0 is more involved. it would be necessary to choose

 imaginary, so that these orbits cannot be described in terms of a pair of real

chiral elds  only. in general we have:

(2.39)

nevertheless, we can describe the subset of orbits  ccl

(2.44)

in conclusion, the canonical structure of the orbits with b

0 < 0 is captured by

two pairs of chiral free elds with indenite signature, one pair with a back-

ground charge and the other without improvement, verifying a constraint. we

7

must note that, in contrast with the subset of orbits b

0  0, the presence of

the parameters b

0 in the stress tensor (2.44) makes dicult to derive it from a

boundary action. this fact will be reected in the absence of modular invariance

in the contribution of these orbits to the hilbert space.

one can equivalently describe the orbits  ccl

the elds a have elliptic monodromy

a(x  2) = eia(x)

(2.46)

(2.47)

(2.48)

where  = 4|| ]0, 2]. note that anti-de sitter space (b+

0 =  ccl
48 )
corresponds to the trivial monodromy  = 2. for spinless solutions (j = 0),

0 = b

i.e. + = , we can again join the two chiral sectors to give a real liouville

eld, like in (2.36), with symplectic form and stress tensor given by (2.37) and

(2.38).

3 quantization

we have seen that the subset of the virasoro orbits with b

0  0 are described

by two chiral free elds with a classical background charge qcl = q ccl

allows a straightforward quantization. at the quantum level

and the central charge is

q = r ccl

c = 1 + 3q2

(3.1)

(3.2)

due to the presence of the background charge, the state-operator correspon-

dence for momentum eigenstates have the following form

and it follows that

therefore the contribution of this sector to the hilbert space is

(3.6)

where h(h ) are virasoro representations with lowest l0( l0) eigenvalue

48  b

0 < 0 the canonical structure of the orbits is more

in contrast, for  ccl

involved. we need two pairs of chiral elds (, ) obeying the constraint

(2.42). the quantization can be carried out consistently imposing the following

condition on the physical states | i

h |: e2p 3

c  :  :  :| i = 0

(3.7)

it is important to note that the two terms of the quantum constraint are primary

elds with the same conformal weight. the rst term is a chiral vertex operator

and coincides with the dimension of the second term since  are free elds

without improvements. moreover, the quantum virasoro algebras are generated

by the operator version of (2.44), which weakly commute with the constraint

giving rise, in the light of the ads/cft duality, to the central charge (3.2).

therefore, the quantum central charge of 2+1 gravity coincides with that of

liouville theory with classical central charge ccl = 3

from the classical point-particle solutions add to the hilbert space the following

(3.8)

from the geometrical point of view these results are consistent whit the fact

that all orbits with b

it is interesting to remark that all the orbits dis1/s1 are

kahler manifolds [29], but only dis1/sl(n)(2, r) with n = 1 admit a kahler
structure [21]. in other words, only ads3 (b

48 ) generate a quantizable

0 =  ccl

orbit with a sl(2, r) symmetry.

4 conclusions and nal comments

we have shown that the phase space of ads3 gravity, with the brown-henneaux

boundary conditions, can be described in terms of the coadjoint orbits of the

virasoro group and splits into two sectors. the sector associated to classical

black hole solutions is described by a pair of chiral free elds with a background

charge giving rise to a quantum central charge equal to that of a liouville the-

ory. however, only when j = 0 the two chiral free elds can be summed up

to produce a scalar eld which can also be mapped, through a canonical trans-

formation, into a liouville eld with hyperbolic and parabolic solutions. the

second sector requires two pairs of chiral free elds, one of then with a back-

ground charge, obeying a special constraint. moreover, this sector is canonically

equivalent, for j = 0, to a classical liouville eld with elliptic monodromy. nev-

ertheless it is important to point out that, although the classical solutions of

three-dimensional gravity with j = 0 can be associated to classical solutions of

liouville theory, we have seen that the primary description of the gravity the-

ory appears in terms of chiral free elds and therefore the correspondence with

liouville theory is not valid at the quantum level, as it has been suggested in

[16]. only remains true in the rst sector, which can be related to normalizable

solutions of quantum liouville theory [15]. the set of virasoro representations

10

emerging in this sector (3.6) is modular invariant, but this is no longer true

for the second sector and cardys formula does not apply. this can be checked

immediately because, by direct counting, the asymptotic density of states is the

same as in the rst sector and it is controlled by cef f = 1. therefore, a hilbert

space of a cft which could explain the bekenstein-hawking entropy requires

an enlarged hilbert space

n, h  h  ,

m, 0

(4.1)

where the positive integer coecients n, , which stand for the multiplicities

of the corresponding virasoro representations, are such that ensures modular

invariance. the gravity theory with the standard brown-henneaux bound-

ary conditions is able to see the dierent virasoro representations entering the

hilbert space, but not the corresponding multiplicities. this work is left to an

additional microscopic structure like string theory [17, 18] or the twisted states

recently introduced in [20].

the recent paper [30] also analyzes three-dimensional gravity using the coad-

joint orbits of the virasoro group.
