abstract

we consider the spectrum of open strings for non-bps d-brane conguration in type
ii string theory on a calabi-yau threefold. in general, there is no degeneracy between
bosonic and fermionic states. however we nd special values for the moduli space of
calabi-yau threefolds there are non-bps brane congurations which have an exact de-
generacy between bosonic and fermionic states. for these values there is no force be-
tween pairs of non-bps d-branes. this gives rise to a possibility of building diverse non-
supersymmetric gauge eld theories on the brane world-volume. we use the approach
recently elaborated by gaberdiel and sen.

introduction

our current understanding of string theory suggests that there are ve consistent super-
string models: type iia, type iib, type i , so(32) and e8  e8 heterotic and a unique
eleven dimensional supergravity theory, all of them being perturbative expansions of an
underlying theory , m theory. we know how to connect various corners of m theory
moduli space corresponding to dierent string theories but we do not have a clear picture
of what happens in the intermediate region.

the main tool to connect various theories are d-branes which are solitons with the
property that the open strings can end on them. they are supersymmetric solutions of
the equations of motion and sit in the short representations of the supersymmetry algebra
(bps states). the last property allows the d-branes to remain stable when one goes from
a weak to a strong coupling constant.

an important question is what happens when we try to analyze the non-perturbative
duality beyond the bps level. are the non-bps states stable? if yes, how do we map
them in duality?

the existence of stable non-bps d-branes has signicant ramications on the gauge
eld theories on the d-brane world-volume. as in the case of supersymmetric eld theories
studied from supersymmetric brane congurations (for a detailed review see [1]), non-
supersymmetric gauge eld theory can be studied from the non-bps d-branes if there is
no interacting force between them.

the study of non-bps states has started with the work of sen [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] who
built non-bps d-branes by considering pairs of branes-antibranes and applying an orbifold
gso projection. in [5, 6] the heterotic/type i duality was tested at non-bps level by
identifying non-bps and stable states which are mapped into each other. in [10, 11, 12,
13, 14], the d-branes were considered as boundary states in the closed string theory that
satisfy dierent projections and conservation conditions. for detailed reviews of non-
bps d-branes and their use see [15, 16, 17]. when the bps d-branes are regarded as
tachyonic kinks solutions on non-bps d-branes of higher dimensions, descent relations
between bps and non-bps states are obtained and this allows to identify the d-brane
charges with elements of k-theory as in [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26].

in [18], non-supersymmetric systems of d-branes in type iia/iib string theory com-
pactied on an orbifold k3 were considered. for special points in the moduli space of the
k3 orbifold an exact bose-fermi degeneracy in the open string spectrum was obtained.
this means that up to one loop in open string theory, the d-branes do not exert any force
between them.

in this paper we go one step further by considering non-supersymmetric systems of
d-branes compactied on a calabi-yau threefold in type iia/iib string theory. this
will give rise to a four dimensional non-supersymmetric theory. the calabi-yau threefold
considered in this paper is a quotient of a product of the k3 orbifold and a two dimensional
torus. this particular calabi-yau orbifold has been considered in [27, 7]. the d-branes

1

we consider wrap cycles of this calabi-yau threefold and are also extended in some of the
non-compact directions. in t-dual description, these d-branes wrap non-supersymmetric
cycles on a calabi-yau threefold. by using these brane conguration, we are going to study
the one-loop partition function with open strings and the tree-level partition function with
closed strings. we show that both these partition functions vanish at special points of
the moduli space of calabi-yau threefold. this implies that the branes do not exert any
force between them.

the content of this paper is as follows: in section 2 we describe a calabi-yau threefold
that we are interested in and its corresponding cycles. in section 3 we describe the non-
bps states and we calculate the one-loop partition function by using open strings ending
on the corresponding non-bps d-branes. in section 3 we calculate the tree level partition
function from a closed string approach. we nd the critical radii of the compact directions
for which the partition function vanishes.

2 cycles on a calabi-yau threefold

we consider d branes wrapped on non-supersymmetric 2-cycle or 3-cycle of a calabi-yau
threefold. the calabi-yau threefold we are concerned is a quotient of t 6 by z2 z2. this
was considered in [27, 7]. let x4, . . . , x9 be the coordinates of t 6 with radii r4, . . . , r9.
the action of z2  z2 will be generated by the actions i4,i4 such that

i4 : (x4, . . . x9)  (x4, x5,x6,x7,x8,x9)
i4 : (x4, . . . x9)  (x4,x5,x6 + r6,x7, x8 + r8, x9) .

(2.1)
(2.2)

thus we compactify type iia string theory t 6 and mod out the theory by the z2  z2
symmetry. by modding out by the rst action i4 on t 6, we obtain t 2  t 4/z2. there
are 16 xed points on t 4 under z2 induced by i4. thus there are 16 tori which form the
singular locus of t 2  t 4/z2. by blowing up the 16 xed points on t 4/z2, we obtain a
product of a torus t 2 and a k3 surface. now we return to the singular space t 2  t 4/z2
and note that i4 induces an involution on t 2  t 4/z2 without xed points. this is
because x8-coordinates are shifted by r8. by taking a further quotient of t 2  t 4/z2
by i4, we obtain a calabi-yau orbifold. the singular locus on this calabi-yau orbifold
is the images of 16 xed tori under i4. thus the singular locus consists of 8 tori.
to construct a non-bps d-brane conguration on this calabi-yau orbifold, we have to
begin with a non-bps d-brane conguration wrapping on cycles on t 6 which are invariant
under i4 and i4. the i4 and i4 invariant cycles on t 6 are the images of i4 invariant
cycles on t 2  t 4/z2 under the quotient map i4. we may obtain i4 invariant two or
three cycles on t 2  t 4/z2 in the following manner. let c be a 1-cycle on t 2 and s be a
2-cycle on t 4/z2. we denote the images of c under i4 by c and the images of s under
i4 by s respectively. then s + s and c  s + c  s are i4 invariant two and three

2

cycles on t 2  t 4/z2 respectively. then by taking a quotient by i4 we obtain cycles on
the calabi-yau orbifold t 2  t 4/z2  z2.

3 open string approach

we want to study the case of a non-bps state of type iia string theory on the calabi-
yau orbifold constructed in 2.
in order to have a non-bps d-brane in type iia on
the calabi-yau orbifold, we need to have an odd number of tangential directions of the
d-brane along t 6. then we take a union of a non-bps d-brane and its transformation
under i4 action.
more specically, we start with a d1 string wrapped along the compact x9-th direction
located at the xed points of the action i4 which, after t-duality, can be identied with a
d-brane wrapped on a non-supersymmetric 2-cycle. in general, the p-branes we deal with
in this paper are extended along the non-compact directions except the x9-th direction.
the non-compact directions are transverse to the calabi-yau orbifold. thus we have a
p-brane d at

and its transformation d at

x4 = x5 = x6 = x7 = x8 = 0 ,

x4 = x5 = 0, x6 = r6,

x7 = 0,

x8 = r8 .

(3.1)

(3.2)

the pair d, d gives a non-bps d-brane conguration on the t 6 which is invariant under
i4 and i4. we will also discuss the case x4 6= 0, x5 6= 0 in the second part of this section.
now we will calculate the open string partition function and show it vanishes at the
critical radii in (x6, x7, x8, x9) direction:

along the directions for which both ends obey dirichlet (d) boundary conditions.

and 
r are the bosonic and fermionic oscillators satisfying the usual commutation and

anti-commutation relations. the index n always will be integer values, whereas the index
r will be integer (integer + 1
2 ) values in the r (ns) sector for directions satisfying the
same boundary condition at both ends of the open string (i.e. both neumann (n) or both
dirichlet (d)). for directions satisfying dierent boundary conditions at the two ends of
the open string (one d and one n) the index n will be integer+ 1
2 values and the index r
will be integer + 1
2 (integer) values in the r (ns) sector. the normal ordering constant co
vanishes in the r-sector and is equal to  1
8 in the ns sector (in  = 1 units) where
s denotes the number of coordinates satisfying d-n boundary conditions.

2 + s

for each d brane we have two dierent chan-paton factors - the 22 identity matrix i
and the pauli matrix 1. because we have 2 d-branes, there are four chan paton sectors
and these four sectors are dd, dd, dd, dd respectively.
in order to calculate the
open string partition function, we need to calculate the contribution from sectors which
are invariant under i4 but the action of i4 just exchanges the dd sector with dd
sector and the dd sector with the dd sector so that its action just reduces the number
of open strings by half. thus it is enough to consider the contribution from the dd and
dd sectors. as discussed in [18] the combined contribution of the chan paton factors
from ns sector states is:

(3.12)

before calculating the contributions to the partition function we need to make some
observations. the d brane is located at x6 = 0, x8 = 0, the d brane is located at

x6 = r6, x8 = r8, and the distance between them is q(r6)2 + (r8)2. to take care

of the winding modes computation of the open string properly, one needs to choose new
rotated coordinates x6, x8 for the (x6, x8) plane. the new coordinates will be given by

x6 = r8x6  r6x8,

x8 = r6x6 + r8x8.

(3.13)

in new coordinates, two dimensional torus in the (x6, x8)-direction will be of radiiqr2

in x8-direction. in view of this, we adopt a new notation

in x6-direction and

.

(3.14)

the denominator 2 in the denition of r6 reects the fact that the string is stuck between

two d branes q(r6)2 + (r8)2 apart. note that the winding modes of the open string

will be in in the (x4, x5, x6, x7, x8) directions and the momenta of the string will be in
the x9 direction because d branes impose neumann boundary conditions along the x9
direction.

we now evaluate the terms from dierent sectors. we take rst the untwisted ns
sector. all the traces are taken over the full fock space of the open string and includes
a sum (integral) over various various momentum and winding numbers and a sum over
chan paton sectors. if we consider the dd sector, then the summation over the winding
modes in the x6 directions will involve only integer winding modes i.e. even-integers in
terms of r6. this is because strings start and end on the same d brane and thus cover r6
an even number of times. if we consider the dd sector, then we sum over odd-integers
in terms of r6 because the strings starting and ending on dierent d-branes cover an odd
number of times r6. if we consider both sectors then we obtain a summation over all
integer winding numbers, thus the term which corresponds to winding modes in the x6
direction is (r6). the same discussion holds for the untwisted sector. if we now consider
the twisted r sector, it can come only from strings ending on the same brane, so it comes
only from the dd sector. considering all of the above we obtain:

trn s(e2tho) = a(2t) p

trn s(e2tho(1)f  g) = 4a(2t) p

trr(e2tho) = a(2t) p

tions.
in (3.15) and (3.17) we use the fact that we have six compact coordinates and
we considered the winding modes on ve of them and the momentum in the x9 compact
direction. in formula (3.16) we do not have any contribution from the winding modes
on the x6, x7, x8, x9 directions but we have contribution from the winding modes on the
x4, x5 directions because they are not acted upon by i4 so they survive the projection.
we now add the contributions from equations (3.5) and (3.6) to obtain the following
partition function:

we want to know when this amplitude becomes zero. first we observe that the term
involving x4 and x5 factors out and therefore there is no conditions for the radius of the
torus in the x4 and x5 directions. for the other 4 directions, if r7 = r6 = r8 = 1/2
and r9 = 2 i.e. at the critical radii, then the contribution of the winding modes and
momenta will be

(3.21)

(3.22)

taking into account our denition (3.14), the original critical radii are r6 = r8 = 1.
by plugging now (3.20) in (3.18), we obtain that the contribution of the dd sector
to the partition function is zero at the critical radii r7 = r6 = r8 = 1/2, r9 = 2. we

see that the critical radius condition has to be only imposed on the 6,7,8 and 9 directions,
the 4 and 5 directions having arbitrary radii.

we need to check whether the critical radii give a tachyon free model. we do this by
calculating the mass of the ns sector ground state of the dd string, this represents a
scalar with m2 = (r2

8 + r2

the critical radii are the ones where we have bose-fermi degeneracy at the massless
level. because besides the compact directions we have (x1, x2, x3) non-compact directions,
the branes can be at dierent positions in those directions. but this just introduces an
overall extra factor of qr2/22
in front of the partition function which is associated with
the tension of the open string stretched over a distance r. the potential energy depends
on the non-compact direction r and is equal to the negative of the partition function. it
vanish identically for any value of r and is a monotonically decreasing function of r. it
is positive denite because the partition function becomes negative when we leave the

, r6 = r8 = 1, r9 = 2 critical radii case. therefore for r7 > 12

we have discussed the case when the d and d branes are at x4 = x5 = 0. what
happens when the d brane is displaced from this point to x4 = b4, x5 = b5 where b4 or b5
is non-zero? then the d must be displaced to x4 = b4, x5 = b5 in order to have an
i4 invariant conguration. in this case the mass of the ns sector ground state is

m2 =

(2b4/)2 + (2b5/)2 + r2

so the condition of a tachyon free theory is

4(b4/)2 + 4(b5/)2 + r2

6 + r2

8 = 2.

(3.23)

(3.24)

here we assume that 0 < b4 < r4 and 0 < b5 < r5 but, by considering the winding
modes in (x4, x5) directions from the winding modes in (x6, x7, x8) separately, one can see
that the partition function remains to be the same as in our main case (3.18) because i4
projection does not act on the (x4, x5) directions and again i4 just exchanges the dierent
sectors. this implies that r2
8 must be 2 if we want the partition function to vanish.
we conclude that b4 b5 must be zero in order to have a tachyon free theory.

4 closed string approach

we now compare the results of the previous section with the ones obtained from a closed
string theory point of view, where the d branes are viewed as boundary states [28, 29,
30, 31]. we want rstly to identify the boundary states describing the pair of d-branes
wrapped on one direction of the orbifold. before the i4 projection, the boundary state

7

that represents the non-bps brane is of the form [11]:

|fdp, a, b, ci =

where we use (0, r9) to show that we have to make the summation over the rr compo-
nents of the twisted sector boundary states located at x9 = 0 and x9 = r9 respectively.
 is the charge of the twisted rr sector and can have values . in the above formula we
represents the coordinates of the noncompact directions by a,the x4, x5, x7 coordinates by
b and the x6, x8 coordinates by c respectively. we consider only the sector with twisted
rr charge equal to 1. after taking the i4 projection, we need to consider a state which
is the superposition of two such non-bps branes located at dierent values of c, the rst
one at c1 = (0, 0) and the second one at c2 = (r6, r8). this state is written as:

|fdpi = |fdp, a, b = 0, c1i + |fdp, a, b = 0, c2i ,

where we consider both branes to be located at b = 0. this state is invariant under
the i4 because the rst term is exchanged with the second one. in order to be able to
map the boundary state into itself under the action of i4 we need to chose the same 
parameters for both branes.
we are interested in the tree level amplitude that describes the exchange of closed
strings between two such non-bps d-branes invariant under i4 and i4. the amplitude
is given by

the constant cc is -1 in the untwisted nsns sector and 0 in the twisted rr sector. ~p
and ~w denote the momentum and winding charges as usual.

in order to calculate the partition function, we need to introduce the corresponding

boundary states in the equation (4.1).

we can now proceed to calculate the tree level closed string amplitude. because of the
action of i4, the amplitude describing the emission and re-absorption of closed strings by
the d-brane located at c1 is equal to the contribution of the d-brane located at c2 and we
take only once this contribution. also, the amplitude describing the emission of a closed
string by the brane at c1 and absorption by the brane at c2 is equal with the amplitude
describing the inverse process. in order to obtain the amplitude, we need to calculate 4

terms, the rst between |fdp, a, b = 0, c1i and |fdp, a, b = 0, c2i, the second one between

8

|fdp, a, b = 0, c2i and |fdp, a, b = 0, c1i, the third one between |fdp, a, b = 0, c1i and
itself and the fourth between |fdp, a, b = 0, c2i and itself. we add all these terms and
then divide by 2 because of the i4 projection.
we need to identify the untwisted and twisted sectors. as any orbifold discussion,
the twisted sectors appears at xed points of the orbifold. because the d-branes are at
xed points of i4, the twisted sectors are obtained from the amplitude of emission and
absorption by the same brane and we only take the contribution once, as discussed before.
the untwisted sector is obtained from both the amplitude of emission by one brane and
absorption by the other brane and from the amplitude of emission and absorption by the
same brane. another dierence which arises in our case is that we need to have in the
twisted sector the winding modes coming from the two compact directions x4 and x5 that
i4 is not acting upon. then the contribution from the twisted rr sector will be

here the factor 1/4 comes from the fact that the charge of the twisted rr sector  in

the boundary state decomposition (4.1) are equal for the two branes. fn 2 in (4.5) is a

normalization constant to be determined later.

in order to calculate the untwisted sector contribution to the amplitude, we need to

remember the form for the states appearing in the untwisted rr sector. they are:

later. here we are taking integration over the directions transverse to the d-brane and

the terms in the left hand sides come from the closed strings emitted and absorbed by
the same d-brane (rst and fourth) and from the closed strings emitted and absorbed by
dierent branes situated at 0 and 2r6 where r6 is dened in (3.14). this is non-zero only
for even-integer values for m, therefore the summation over the winding modes on the
x6 direction will be over even-integer numbers. then the contribution of the untwisted

where q = e2l and n ,fn are the normalization constants introduced for the boundary

states. the power of l comes from the fact that the d-brane is extended in p of the 4
non-compact directions.

to determine the normalization constants, we apply a modular transformation t = 1/2l
which changes the closed string tree amplitude into an open string 1-loop amplitude. using
the properties of the fi functions,

f1(e/t) = tf1(et) ,
f3(e/t) = f3(et) ,

f2(e/t) = f4(et) ,
f4(e/t) = f2(et) ,

if we choose r6 = r8 = r7 = 1/2, r9 = 2, then the partition function becomes zero.
the corresponding values for r6, r8 are r6 = r8 = 1. so, by using the boundary state
formalism we found critical radii for which the tree level partition function vanishes.

things might change if one takes higher-loop corrections in both open string and closed

string theories.
