abstract

three-dimensional bicovariant dierential calculus on the quantum group suq(2)

is constructed using the approach based on global covariance under the action of the

stabilizing subgroup u (1). explicit representations of possible q-deformed lie alge-

bras are obtained in terms of dierential operators. the consistent gauge covariant

dierential calculus on suq(2) is uniquely dened. a non-standard leibnitz rule is

proposed for the exterior dierential. minimal gauge theory with suq(2) quantum

group symmetry is considered.

1 introduction

one of the features of non-commutative geometry in the quantum group theory [1-5] is

non-uniqueness in dening a dierential calculus on the quantum groups and quantum

spaces. the bicovariance condition determines a unique dierential calculus on the linear

1
q

quantum groups glq(n) (up to symmetry corresponding to the exchange q 

) [6,

7] and provides existence of the corresponding gauge covariant dierential algebra [8].

direct reducing the glq(n)-bicovariant dierential calculus to a case of the special linear

quantum group slq(n) encounters diculties connected with a loss of the centrality

condition for a quantum determinant. four-dimensional 4d bicovariant and three-

dimensional (3d) left-covariant dierential calculi on the simplest special unitary quantum

group suq(2) were considered as well using a standard woronowicz approach [3, 6]. a full

consistent construction of the 3d bicovariant dierential calculus and a gauge covariant

dierential algebra on the suq(2) are unknown up to now, furthermore, there are strong

limitations imposed by no-go theorems [8]. a possible way to solve this problem suggests

using a non-standard leibnitz rule as it was considered in ref. [9].

in this paper possible 3d bicovariant dierential calculi and gauge covariant dierential

algebra on the quantum group suq(2) are considered in the framework of approach which

respects a global u(1)-covariance. the group u(1) is a stabilizing subgroup for the quan-

tum group suq(2) and the u(1)-covariant treatment allows to pass straightforward to the
description of the quantum sphere s2
q  suq(2) /u(1) . in section 2 we construct explicit
representations of q-deformed lie algebras of left-invariant vector elds on suq(2) in terms

of dierential operators. the u(1)-covariance constraint reduces the variety of possible

covariant dierential calculi on suq(2) and leads to a unique gauge covariant dieren-

tial algebra as it is shown in section 3. we propose non-standard leibnitz rules for the

exterior dierential which are compatible with the quantum group suq(2) structure and

gauge covariance. section 4 is devoted to construction of the minimal quantum group

gauge theory of suq(2) .

q-deformed lie algebras

following the r-matrix formalism [4] the main commutation relation for the generators
t i
j (i, j = 1, 2) of the quantum group suq(2) is dened by a standard r-matrix as follows

r12t1t2 = t2t1r12.

where xi, yi are generators (coordinates) of the function algebra on the quantum her-
mitean vector space u 2

hereafter the suq(2) indices are raised and lowered with the invariant metric ij(12 =

q ).

supesymmetric theories. the coordinates (x, y) parametrize the quantum sphere s2

the parametrization (2.2) was used in a harmonic formalism [10] of extended supereld
q 
suq(2) /u(1) and are just the quantum generalizations of classical harmonic functions
(u) (so called harmonics)

xi  u+i,

yi  ui.

the signs () correspond to charges (1) of a stabilizing subgroup u(1) for the quantum

group suq(2) . to simplify notations we shall not pass to the notations adopted in

the harmonic formalism keeping in mind that all geometric objects (like coordinates,

derivatives, dierential forms etc.) have denite u(1) charges.

consider main commutation relations between the coordinates (x, y) and derivatives

xi , i 

on the quantum group suq(2) :

the commutation relations (2.3) do not dier on principle from ones given in ref. [11]. our

choice is motivated by using manifest covariant tensor notations which are convenient in

constructing explicit representations for the q-lie algebras. thus, one implies all geometric

3

objects with upper (lower) indices to be transformed under the quantum group co-action
 like classical co-(contra-) variant tensors. for instance, a second rank tensor n j
be transformed as follows

i will

(n j

i ) = (t )k

i t j

(2.4)

(hereafter the signs n of tensor product are omitted).

let us dene the left-invariant rst-order dierential operators

d++  xi i,

d  yii,

where () correspond to u(1) charges (2). the action of the operators d on the

coordinates (x, y) has a simple form

d++xi = 0,

dxi = yi,

d++yi = xi,

dyi = 0.

the leibnitz rule for these dierential operators may be written in a convenient form

if one considers their action on functions with denite u(1) charges. the functions are

dened in analogy with the classical case [10] and can be decomposed in formal series

f (n0)(x, y) =



x

k=1

c(i1i2...ik+nj1j2...jk)xi1xi2...xik+nyj1yj2...yjk,

(2.5)

where c(i1i2...ik+nj1j2...jk) are -number coecients symmetrized over all indices. functions
with negative charges are dened in a simillar manner. after some calculations one can
nd the next leibnitz rule for the operators d:

d(f (m)g(n)) = (df (m))g(n) + qmf (m)dg(n).

(2.6)

this is a special feature of quantum group non-commutative geometry that the quan-

tum analogue to classical u(1) generator can be realized as a second-order dierential

operator

d0  xii  q2yi

i + (1  q2)xiyk

ki.

(2.7)

the operator d0 has eigenfunctions which are just the functions with denite u(1)

charges

d0f (n) = {n}qf (n),

{n}q 

1  q2n
1  q2 ,

(2.8)

4

where {n}q
operator d0

is a q-number. it is not hard to check the following leibnitz rule for the

d0(f (m)g(n)) = (d0f (m))g(n) + q2mf (m)d0g(n).

(2.9)

reducing the space of functions on suq(2) to the space of functions with a denite
u(1) charge one obtains the covariant description of the coset s2

q  suq(2) /u(1) .

by direct calculating one can verify that the operators d,0 form the q-deformed lie

algebra of suq(2) [12]

[d0, d++]

q4 = {2}qd++,
[d++, d]q2 = d0,

[d0, d]

q4 = {2}qd,

(2.10)

here, [a, b]qs  ab qsba. note, that the algebra (2.10) is valid irrespective of whether
one imposes the unimodularity constraint d = 1. we shall treat the algebra (2.10) as a

main q-deformed lie algebra of left-invariant vector elds on the quantum group suq(2) .

a corresponding q-generalized jacobi identity is available

[d0, [d++, d]q2] + [d++, [d, d0]q4]q2

+q2[d, [d0, d++]

q4]

q2 = 0.

let us now pass to constructing other possible q-deformed lie algebras of left-invariant

vector elds on the suq(2) . for this purpose we consider dierential operators ,  [13]

 = 1 + (q2  1)yi i,

 = 1 + (1 

1
q2 )xii.

(2.11)

one can see that the operators ,  obey the simple commutation relations

d = q2d,

d++ =

1
q2 d++,

d0 = d0,

 = .

similar formulae hold for the operator  as well. using these relations one can nd that
the operators d++, d, d0 dened by the next equations

d++ =  1

2 d++,

d =  1

d0 =

d0  [0]q

generate just the drinfeld-jimbo quantum algebra

[0, d++] = 2d++,

[0, d] = 2d,

[d++, d] = [0]q.

5

(2.12)

to construct other possible q-lie algebras one introduces another dierential operators

++, , 0 as follows

++ = d++,  =

q2  1

q2p

z 1pd,

(2.13)

0 =

1  z s
1  q2s ,
z  () 1
2 ,

zf (n) = qnf (n).

the operators ,0 generate the next q-deformed lie algebra:

++  q2p++ =

z 2  1
z 1+p
0++  q2s++0 = ++,

,

0  q2s0 = q2s,

where s, p  arbitrary integers. the equation (2.13) allows to express the operator z in
terms of 0, then the arbitrariness in the choice of parameters s, p can be reduced by
considering only quadratic in ,0 q-commutators.

3 gauge covariant dierential algebra

in this section we give description of possible suq(2) bicovariant dierential algebras with

u(1) conserved charge. the gauge covariance condition leads to a unique dierential

algebra of suq(2) . at the same time a leibnitz rule for the exterior dierential is not

xed yet. to nd the dierentiation rules one needs to choose a corresponding q-lie

algebra of left-invariant vector elds.

consider the left-invariant cartan 1-forms  on the quantum group suq(2)
 = dt t  


0
++
 q20


 ,

where 0, ++,  are the basic left-invariant dierential 1-forms with corresponding

u(1) charges (0, +2, 2). one denes gauge transformations as follows

t g = t t,

g =   t  t,

  d t 1 t ,

(3.1)

where the matrix t commutes with the matrices t, dt and satises the same equation
(2.1) as for the matrix t . in the case of gauge symmetry the matrices t , t depend on

6

the coordinates of a base space-time and the connection 1-form a has the same transfor-
mation and commutation properties as the right invariant 1-form dt t . it turns out that

the requirement of global u(1)-covariance and the consistence with the quantum group

structure determine uniquely all commutation relations between the dierential 1-forms

 and the coordinates (x, y). as a result we have

++x = qx++,

x =

x +

++y =

q

y++,

0x = x0 + (1 

1
q2 )y++,

0y = y0.

y = qy,

(3.2)

similar consideration of commutation relations for the basic dierential 1-forms ,0

leads to covariant algebras parametrized by a real number :

++++ =  = 0, 0 + q20 = 0,

++ + q++ +

q2(1  q)(1 + q2)

q2  1

00 = 0,

00 =

1  q2

q2(1 + q2)

++.

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

it should be noted that the algebra dened by eqs. (3.3-3.5) is bicovariant irrespective

of whether one considers the last relation (3.5). requiring the covariance under the gauge

transformations and using the additional commutation constraint

 = q2 

one nds a unique gauge covariant dierential algebra at  = 4:

++++ =  = 0,

0 + q20 = 0,

(1 + q2)200 =

1
q2 ++ + q2++.

(3.6)

the equation (3.5) is not gauge covariant and should be omitted. so dened gauge

covariant dierential algebra diers from one considered in refs. [6,9].our treatment does
not contain the condition of vanishing for the central element c2  trq(2), which is not
gauge covariant. here we have used the notion of the q-deformed covariant trace [4, 7].

one can rewrite the commutation relations for the gauge covariant dierential algebra

in terms of the r-matrix. direct checking leads to the next formulae

r12dt1t2 = t2dt1r12,

r122r1

12 1 +

l and a21 is the quantum antisymmetrizer [11]. note, that the rst relation

to construct an exterior dierential it is convenient to use the denition based on the

dualism between the exterior algebra of dierential forms and the q-lie algebra of vector

elds. in this way the leibnitz rule is followed straightforwardly and it depends only on

a special choice of the q-lie algebra.

let us start from a general 3d q-lie algebra of left-invariant vector elds da =

(d++, d, d0) on the quantum group suq(2) with a lie bracket

[da, db]b  dadb  babcddcdd = c abcdc.

we consider the matrix babcd to be unitary, so that it generates a representation of the

permutation group. thus, one can easily dene the alteration rules for the tensor algebra

of vector elds. moreover, a generalized jacobi identity will be available as well.

the basic left-invariant dierential 1-forms a are dened as dual objects by means
of the scalar product a(db) = ab . the action of the exterior dierential on arbitrary

functions f and dierential 1-forms u is dened in analogy with the classical case [14]

df (da) = daf,

du(da, db) = 

1
2

(dau(db)  babcddcu(dd)  u([da, db]b),

(3.9)

du(da, db) = babcddu(dc, dd).

rules for the exterior dierentiation of the dierential (n > 1)-forms can be generalized

in a similar fashion. the cartan-maurer equations have a standard form

dd(da, db) =

1
2

c abcd(dc).

(3.10)

as a concrete example we consider the q-lie algebra (2.10) which is consistent with the

gauge covariant algebra of left-invariant dierential 1-forms (3.7). in that case dierenti-

ation rules (3.9) can be rewritten in a more familiar form after using the explicit tensor
representation for the exterior products of 2-forms a  b. after some calculations one

nds

df = adaf,

d(++f ) = d++f + 0++d0f  d0d++f,

d(f ) = df + q20d0f + q2d0df,
d(0f ) = d0f + q2++0df + 0d++f,

 

1 + q4

q2(1 + q2)

.

8

(3.11)

it should be noted that the formulae (3.11) involve just three independent basis dierential
2-forms 0++, 0, d0 in the space of exterior 2-forms in correspondence with the
classical case. the fourth linearly independent basis 2-form 0 can be dened as follows

0 =

1

1 + q2 (++ + q2++),

the form 0 takes a non-zero value only for the symmetrical tensor product d0 n d0:

0(d0, d0) = ,

where the number  vanishes in the classical limit q  1. due to this property the form
0 does not appear in eqs. (3.11).

to construct the dierentiation rules for the (n > 1)-forms it is convenient to use the

specic structure of the exterior algebra of suq(2) . it is easy to check that the invariant

2-form

c 

q4

1 + q2 + q4 c2 =

q2
1 + q2 (++ + ++)

is a central element. we put the natural constraint

d(c(n)f ) = cd((n)f ).

(3.12)

(3.13)

using this constraint and starting from the most general form for dierention rules one

nds

d(0f ) = q4df,

d(++f ) =

d(++f ) =

cdf + d0f,

1

1
q2 cdf  d0f,
cd0f  q4c0++df 

d(0++f ) =

1


1
q2 c0d++f,

(3.14)

d(f ) = 0,

 

1
2

(0++  q20++) ,

where  is a volume 3-form on the suq(2) .

all basis dierential forms of order n > 3 can be obtained from lower order forms

multiplied by the invariant c in an appropriate degree. so that the relations ( 3.11, 3.14)

complete the dierential rules for the dierential algebra of suq(2) .

having carried out some calculations one can also nd the explicit expressions for the

cartan-maurer equations (3.10)

d = 2 

q2
1 + q2 i trq2.

the right hand side of the equation contains only the traceless part of 2.

4 construction of the minimal suq(2) gauge theory

a minimal gauge theory corresponding to the quantum algebra suq(2) was proposed in

ref. [15], where the initial gauge transformations contain by denition the antipodal map.

one can try to formulate a gauge yang-mills theory for the quantum group suq(2) in

analogy with a covariant glq(n) version proposed in ref.

[7]. for this purpose one

should dene the algebra of main operators (matter elds and gauge potential) and a

corresponding comodule structure.

in the case of the quantum group suq(2) it is convenient to put the matter eld i( i)
into one matrix  = ( i i) . the operators (, d) generate the z2-graded algebra
z with the same commutation relations as for the dierential algebra of suq(2) . the

algebra z is a left suq(2) -comodule with the following co-action:

  g = t ,

d  (d)g = (dt ) + t (d).

all axioms for the comodule are fullled.

(4.1)

(4.2)

we introduce also an operator a (gauge potential 1-form) satisfying the same com-

mutation relations as for the right-invariant cartan 1-forms on the suq(2) . one can

consider the quantum analogue to the gauge transformation for the a:

a  ag = t at  + (dt )t .

a covariant dierential  acting on the matter eld is dened as

 = (d  a).

the curvature 2-form f is introduced as follows

1

f = da  a2 +

1 + q2 trqa2
and it contains only traceless part.

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

to dene the commutation relations in the algebra g generated by the operators

(, d, a, da) we will take into account the compatibility conditions with the gauge

transformations and the centrality property for the quantum determinant detq = 1.

the commutation relations for the operators , a are uniquely dened from the formula

(3.7), since the gauge potential a in a pure gauge limit is just the right-invariant cartan

form on the quantum group suq(2) , so we have

1a2 = r21a2r1

21 1.

(4.6)

10

we demand the covariant combination (f ) to have the same commutation relations with

itself and a as for the operator 

(f )1a2 = r21a2r1

21 (f )1,

r12(f )1(f )2 = (f )2(f )1r12.

using these formulae one can easily derive the next commutation relations:

f1r21a2r1

21 = r21a2r1

21 f1, f1r21r2r1

21 = r21r2r1

21 f1,

(4.7)

(4.8)

(4.9)

where r = (d) .

the bicovariance condition, the traceless property for the f and the centrality of the

quantum determinant detq lead to the following commutation relation for the operators

(, f ):

1f2 = r21f2r1

21 1.

from this equation taking into account the eqn. (34) one nds

r12f1r21f2 = f2r12f1r21.

(4.10)

(4.11)

note, that the last equation coincides with the corresponding relation in glq(n) gauge

theory [7]. it is not dicult to check the next simple relations as well:

r1212 = 21r12,
1da2 = r21da2r1

21 1.

(4.12)

(4.13)

the commutation relations obtained above are the main ones which imply all other com-

mutations in the algebra g. to construct a formal expression for the lagrangian of

the gauge theory one needs to specify the underlying space-time and dene the dual -

operation. the simplest variant correspond to the choice of the space-time isomorphic to

the quantum space of suq(2) . another problem is the construction of leibnitz rules for

the exterior dierential which have essentially non-standard form. dierentiation rules
for the algebra of matter elds (i, d) are dened by similar formulae (23, 26) in full

analogy with the case of the dierential algebra of suq(2) . for instance, one has the

following equations for the quadratic combinations of matter elds

d(ij) = dij +

1
q2 idj +

q2  1

q3

ijdkk,

d( i j) = d i j + q2 id j,

d( ij) = d ij + q2 idj + (q2  1) i jdkk.

11

another possible way towards a consistent minimal quantum group gauge yang-mills

theory corresponds to the dierential calculus with a q-lie algebra diered from one

dened by eqs. (2.10).
