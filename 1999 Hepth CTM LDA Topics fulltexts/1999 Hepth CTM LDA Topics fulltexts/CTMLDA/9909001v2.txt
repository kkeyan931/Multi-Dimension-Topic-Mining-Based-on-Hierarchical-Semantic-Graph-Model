abstract

i construct solutions to einsteins equations in 6 dimensions with
bulk cosmological constant and intersecting 4-branes. solutions exist
for a continuous range of 4-brane tension, with long distance gravity
localized to a 3+1 dimensional minkowski intersection, provided that
the additional tension of the intersection satises one condition.

1 introduction

string/m-theory requires the existence of nine or ten spatial dimensions.

traditionally it has been assumed that all but three spatial dimensions are

compact, with size comparable to the planck length. recently it has been

proposed that at least some of the extra dimensions are compact but very

large, with size between a fermi and a millimeter, but that the elds of the

standard model are conned to a 3 + 1 dimensional subspace, or 3-brane

[1, 2]. large new dimensions in which the standard model elds do not

propagate may allow for the unication of gravity with the other forces and

strong quantum gravity eects below the planck scale [3, 4, 5], perhaps as

low as a few tev [1, 2, 6]. an alternative picture due to randall and sun-

drum (rs)[7] also assumes that the standard model is conned to a 3-brane,

but allows for a non-factorizable metric with 4 dimensional minkowski space

embedded in a slice of 5 dimensional anti-desitter (ads) space1. the ex-

ponential dependence of the coecient of the 4 dimensional metric tensor

on an additional coordinate (the warp factor) can provide a explanation

of the weak/planck hierarchy without a large extra dimension [7, 10, 11].

randall and sundrum [12] have pointed out that such a warp factor also al-

lows for a non-compact extra dimension, with a normalizable 0-mode of the

graviton providing eective 3+1 dimensional einsteinian gravity at long dis-

tances, even though there is a continuous, gapless spectrum of kaluza-klein

1these solutions parallel earlier solutions found in 4 dimensions [8] reviewed in ref. [9].

gravitational modes2. such a normalizable zero mode is a general feature

of any space-time metric that has a 3+1 dimensional minkowski subspace

and a warp factor which decreases suciently fast in all new directions [18].

arkani-hamed, dimopoulos, dvali and kaloper (addk) have extended the

rs work to n intersecting (2 + n) branes separating sections of 4 + n dimen-

sional ads space3. both the rs and the addk solutions require a specic

relationship between the brane tensions and the bulk cosmological constants.

in addition, the addk solution requires that there is no additional contri-

bution to the tension of the intersection from brane-brane interactions. in

this note i further generalize the addk solution for the case of 2 new di-

mensions, to the case of ads space containing n ads branes with almost

arbitrary brane tension meeting at a 3+1 dimensional minkowski junction

with localized gravity. one ne-tuning is required as there is a constraint on

the value of the brane-brane interaction contribution to the tension of the

intersection.

2 ads branes in ads space intersecting at

angles

the following metric is a solution to einsteins equations in 5+1 dimensions

with a bulk cosmological constant and a 4-brane located along the y axis.

ds2 = 2(dxdx + dy2 + dz2)

2see also refs. [13, 14, 15, 16, 17].
3as this work was being completed a paper appeared which further generalizes the rs

solution[19].

 = 1/ [1 + k (y cos  + |z| sin )]

here the usual 3+1 dimensions are denoted by x and the 2 new dimensions

by y and z. the brane glues together 2 semi-innite slices of anti-desitter

(ads) space. in units of the 6 dimensional newtons constant, the bulk cos-

mological constant is 10k2 while the brane tension is 8k sin . for  = 90o

this solution trivially generalizes the randall-sundrum metric to one ad-

ditional dimension, and the induced metric on the brane is 5 dimensional

minkowski. otherwise the induced metric is 5 dimensional ads. note that

the angle  is determined by the relationship between 2 apparently nondy-

namical parametersthe brane tension and the bulk cosmological constant.

now consider n branes, intersecting on a 3+ 1 dimensional subspace. be-

tween adjacent pairs of branes is a wedge of 6 dimensional ads space. the

metric within one wedge may be written as in eq. 1 in a coordinate system

where there is one semi-innite brane located along the positive y axis, and

another extending from the origin in the z > 0 half-plane along the line

y cos(2)  z sin(2) = 0. the metric is reection symmetric about the line

y cos()  z sin() = 0. for  = 45o, a solution pasting together 4 such

wedges was found by addk [10]. the addk solutions require a ne-tuned

relation between the bulk cosmological constant and the brane tension, and

also that there be no brane-brane interaction tension localized at the inter-

section. generally, however, one would not expect  = 180o/n for integer

n. however one could still patch together n sections of six dimensional ads

space along n ads 4-branes, by allowing a global decit angle (in analogy

3

with the case of the gauge string metric [20, 21]) of 360o2n. in a spacetime

patch around each brane, in a coordinate system rotated such that the brane

is located at along the positive y axis, the metric is given by eq. 1. thus this

patched together metric is automatically a solution to einsteins equations

everywhere except in the core of the intersection. for a global solution to

exist the brane-brane interaction must produce a specic contribution to the

tension of the intersection region, needed to match the global decit angle.

thus it still appears that one ne tuning of a nondynamical parameter (or

a remnant supersymmetry) is required. perhaps a better understanding of

brane interactions will shed some light on the cosmological constant question.

3 outlook on extra dimensions and the cosm-

sological constant

the idea that noncompact higher dimensions with nonfactorizable spacetime

might be consistent with our successful eective long distance theories and

explain why the cosmological constant is zero has been around for a long

time [22, 13]. the hope is that the metric can adjust such that in equilib-

rium an apparent cosmological term will only aect the part of the metric

corresponding to the additional dimensions. for instance in the case of a

gauge string, the vacuum energy of any eective degrees of freedom which

live only on the string contribute to the string tension, but the induced met-

ric on the string remains minkowski, with any change in the string tension

simply changing the decit angle. extra dimensional theories typically have

4

new light degrees of freedom. new light elds are needed to understand any

cosmological constant adjustment mechanism from an eective eld theory

point of view. it is conceivable that new degrees of freedom associated with

an extra-dimensional metric somehow cleverly avoid the usual problems of

adjustment mechanisms [23]. since the eective four dimensional newtons

constant typically depends on the extra dimensional metric, perhaps a higher

dimensional conguration can be found where apparent low energy contri-

butions to the four dimensional cosmological constant (e.g. the qcd phase

transition) actually just renormalize newtons constant. the conguration

described in this note does not, however, seem so clever.
