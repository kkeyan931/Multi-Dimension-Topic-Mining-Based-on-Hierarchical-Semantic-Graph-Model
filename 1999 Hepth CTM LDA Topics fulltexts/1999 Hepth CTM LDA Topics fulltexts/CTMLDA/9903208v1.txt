a recently proposed model of conning strings has a non-local world-sheet action induced

by a space-time kalb-ramond tensor eld. here we show that, in the large-d approxi-

mation, an innite set of ghost- and tachyon-free truncations of the derivative expansion

of this action all lead to c = 1 models. their infrared limit describes smooth strings

with world-sheets of hausdor dimension dh = 2 and long-range orientational order, as

expected for qcd strings.

1. introduction

nonwithstanding the large amount of evidence [1] suggesting the possibility of a string

description of quark connement, a consistent model of non-critical strings has yet to be

found. the simplest possibility, provided by the nambu-goto string can be consistently
quantized only in d = 26 or d  1 dimensions due to the conformal anomaly [2]. large
world-sheets in euclidean space crumple and the model is inappropriate to describe the

expected smooth strings dual to qcd [3]. in an attempt to cure this problem a naively

marginal term proportional to the square of the extrinsic curvature was added to the action

[4]. the resulting rigid string is, however, dierent from the nambu-goto string only in

the ultraviolet region, since the new term turned out to be infrared irrelevant. thus the

rigidity did not really help in preventing crumpling [5].

recent progress in this eld is based on two types of actions. a rst model of con-

ning strings [6,7]

is based on an induced string action which can be explicitly derived

for compact qed [6,8,9] and for abelian-projected su (2) [10]. in its non-local formu-

lation, the model was independently proposed in [11]. a second proposal [12], analyzed

further in [13], is based on a string action in a ve-dimensional curved space-time with the

quarks living on a four-dimensional horizon. both proposals, whose interrelation has been

investigated in [14], enjoy the necessary zigzag invariance of qcd strings.

in its world-sheet formulation, the induced string possesses a non-local action with

negative stiness [11,8]

just as the world-sheets of magnetic strings of the abelian higgs

model in the london limit of innite higgs mass [9,15] . such an action may be brought

to a quasi-local form via a derivative expansion of the interaction between the surface

elements. for a conventional renormalization group study of the geometric properties of

the uctuating world-sheets we a truncate this derivative expansion. this makes the model

non-unitary, but in a spurious way. in the truncated action the stiness is negative, so

that a stable truncation must include at least a sixth-order term in the derivatives. in [16]

we have shown that this term has the desired properties of solving the infrared problem

of nambu-goto and rigid strings in the large-d approximation. while perturbatively

irrelevant, it becomes relevant in the large-d approximation, a phenomenon familiar from

3d gross-neveu model [17]. it suppresses crumpling and the model has an infrared-stable

xed point corresponding to a tensionless smooth string whose world-sheet has hausdor

dimension dh = 2. the corresponding long-range orientational order is caused by a

frustrated antiferromagnetic interaction between normals, a mechanism rst recognized in

[18] and conrmed by recent numerical simulations [19].

1

the purpose of this paper is to determine the universality class of conning strings

determined by the nite-size scaling of the euclidean eective action of the model [16] on

a cylinder of (spatial) circumference r [20]. in the limit of large r this takes the form

lim


se


= t r 

c(d  2)

6r

+ . . . ,

(1.1)

for (d  2) transverse degrees of freedom, the universality class being encoded in the pure
number c. this suggests that the eective theory describing the infrared behaviour is a

conformal eld theory (cft) with central charge c [21]. in this case the number c also

xes the luscher term [22] in the quark-antiquark potential:

v (r) = t r 

c(d  2)

24r

+ . . . .

(1.2)

by interchanging r in (1.1) with the inverse temperature  we obtain immediately the

low-temperature behaviour of the model. we shall give an estimate of the deconnement

temperature as well as its range of validity.

finally we shall generalize the results of [16] to higher truncations of the original non-

local action and show that the universality class and the geometric properties of world-

sheets are largely independent of the level of the truncation, implying the irrelevance of

the truncation and the spurious non-unitarity deriving from it altogether.

2. finite-size scaling

the truncated world-sheet model of conning strings proposed in [16] is dened in

euclidean space by the action

s =z d2g gab dax(cid:18)t  sd2 +

1

m2 d4(cid:19)dbx ,

(2.1)

where g and da represent, respectively, the determinant and the covariant derivatives with
respect to the induced metric gab = axbx on the world-sheet x (0, 1). the rst
term represents a bare surface tension 2t, while the second accounts for rigidity with a

stiness parameter s which is negative when generated dynamically by a tensor eld in

four-dimensional space-time [11,8] . the last term ensures the stability of the model. since

it contains the square of the gradient of the extrinsic curvature matrices it suppresses the

formation of spikes on the world-sheet. in the large-d approximation it generates a string

2

tension proportional to the square mass m2 which takes control of the uctuations where
the orientational correlation die o. for t, s, m  0, one reaches an infrared xed-point
describing tensionless smooth strings with long-range orientational order [16]. while the

model (2.1) is a toy version of the action induced by an antisymmetric tensor eld, it is

known [23] that qcd strings possess a curvature expansion of exactly this type.

in this paper we shall analyze the leading large-d behaviour of the eective action

on a cylinder of (spatial) circumference r. this is the extension to our model of the

calculations [24] for the nambu-goto string and [25,26]

for the rigid string. contrary

to these papers, however, we consider periodic boundary conditions as in [27] in order to

avoid the problem of a non-uniform saddle-point metric pointed out in [24,25] . in order

to simplify analytic computations we shall moreover equate the stiness to its xed-point

value from the beginning by setting s = 0 in (2.1).

the large-d calculation requires the introduction of a lagrange multiplier matrix ab

enforcing the constraint gab = axbx. the action (2.1) is thus extended to

s  s +z d2g ab (axbx  gab) .

(2.2)

the world-sheet is parametrized in a gauss map as x() = (0, 1, i()) with i =
2, . . . , d  1. here /2  0  /2 and r/2  1  r/2 and i() describe the d  2
transverse uctuations. we look for a saddle-point with diagonal metric gab = diag (0, 1)
and lagrange multiplier ab =  gab. with this ansatz the extended action becomes

s = aext 01(cid:20)(t + )
+z d2g gabai(cid:18)t +  +

01  2(cid:21)

m2 d4(cid:19) bi ,

(2.3)

where aext = r is the extrinsic, projected area in coordinate space. by integrating over
the transverse uctuations we get, in the limit   , an eective action

se = s0 + s1 ,

s0 = aext 01(cid:20)(t + )

(2.6)

where re denotes the real part. we shall dispose of the ultraviolet divergences in

these quantities by analytic regularization. dening rst the logarithm as ln x =

(cid:2)(d/d) x(cid:3)=0, and using the analytic interpolation of the integral [28]

the sums are then regularized by analytic continuation of the formula p

which leads to the well known results for the nambu-goto [24,29] and the rigid [27] strings.

being interested only in the large-r behaviour, we may neglect the exponentially small

(2.17)

third, and multiply the result by 21/t , obtaining

(2.20)

expanding the square-root of this expression and multiplying by rt we obtain the nal
result

se

(d  2)

6r

+ . . . .

(2.21)

thus we conclude that conning strings are characterized by c = 1. although they share

the same value of c, conning strings are clearly dierent c = 1 theories than nambu-goto

or rigid strings. indeed the former are smooth strings on any scale while the latter crumple

and ll the ambient space, at least in the infrared region. our result c = 1 is in agreement

with recent precision numerical determinations [31] of this constant.

3. the deconnement temperature

by changing r into  and 0 into 1 in the above formulas we obtain the behaviour

of the model (2.1) at temperature t = 1/kb. having neglected the contribution of the
bessel functions in (2.14), however, we can only study low temperatures, whith 0 > 1.
using (2.17) and (2.20) we get

2

(cid:18) se
r (cid:19)

= 2t 2 

(d  2)t

3

.

(3.1)

raising the temperature, this quantity, representing the square mass of the lowest state,

crosses zero at an inverse temperature

dec =r (d  2)

3t

=

6

1

ms 128

3(d  2)a2 ,

(3.2)

which species the deconnement temperature of the model. note that this result coincides

with the corresponding one for nambu-goto [29] and rigid [27] strings when expressed in

terms of the string tension.

in order to establish the range of validity of this result we need to know the value of
0. this is obtained by substituting (2.20) into the rst of the saddle-point equations
(2.16), yielding

2a(cid:16)1  (d2)
6t  2 (cid:17)
2a  1
at the deconnement temperature this becomes

0 =

.

(0)dec =

a

2a  1

.

(3.3)

(3.4)

the value (3.2) of the deconnement temperature is consistent with our approximation
only if the equation dec0dec > 1 is satisifed. only then can we neglect the bessel
functions down to the deconnement transition. using the above value of dec and 0dec
this condition translates into

a <(cid:18) 8
6 

1

2(cid:19)  3.5 .

(3.5)

thus, formula (3.2) for the deconnement temperature is reliable in the region of small
(t/m2) where a  1. otherwise there are sizable corrections from the sum over n in (2.14).

4. generalization to higher truncations

having established that the model (2.1) describes smooth strings with c = 1, the

question arises as to how much these results depend on the truncation of the original non-
local action after the d4 term. to answer this question let us consider instead of (2.1) an
arbitrary truncation

s|n =z d2g gab dax vn(cid:0)d2(cid:1) dbx ,

2n

vn(cid:0)d2(cid:1) = (0 + ) 2 +

xk=1

k
2k2 d2k .

(4.1)

here  represents the fundamental mass scale in the model, to be identied with the

qcd mass scale, and we have already included in the action the lagrange multiplier 

arising from (2.2) (note that here we have dened  as a dimensionless quantity). since all

7

expansion coecients k are positive, the series is alternating in momentum space, with

all terms with odd index k being negative [11,18] . thus, stable truncations must end with

an even k = 2n.

following [16], the only condition we shall impose on the coecients k is the absence

of both tachyons and ghosts. this requires that the fourier-transform vn(cid:0)p2(cid:1) has no zeros
on the real p2-axis. the polynomial vn(cid:0)p2(cid:1) has thus n pairs of complex-conjugate zeros

in the complex p2-plane.

for simplicity of computation we shall set all coecients with odd k to zero, 2m+1 =
0 for 0  m  n  1. this, however, is no drastic restriction since, as we shall now
demonstrate, this is their value at the infrared-stable xed point anyhow. with this
simplication all pairs of complex conjugate zeros of vn(cid:0)p2(cid:1) lie on the imaginary axis and
we can represent vn(cid:0)p2(cid:1) as

n

4n2
2n

vn(cid:0)p2(cid:1) =

yk=1(cid:0)p4 + 2

k4(cid:1) ,

(4.2)

with purely numerical coecients k. this expression substitutes (cid:2)p4 + m2(t + )(cid:3) inside

the logarithm in the one-loop contribution (2.4), which becomes

s1 =

n

xk=1

2 re sk

1! ,
l + ik2(cid:1) .

(4.3)

using (2.13) and neglecting as before the bessel functions o for large r, we see that the

only modication to (2.15), (2.16) and (2.17) due to the higher-order truncation is the

substitution

2 

n

xk=1

k2 .

(4.4)

the lagrange multiplier 2 and the string tension t = 2 (0 + ) 2 are now determined
by the new saddle-point equation

d  2
16

 

n

xk=1

k = 0 .

(4.5)

the value c = 1 for the universal term in (2.21), however, remains unchanged.

8

the new saddle-point equation for  is still polynomial, although of higher-order. the

requirement that this polynomial gap  equation has at least one solution on the real axis
with (0 + )  0 provides the condition on the coecients 2m, 0  m  n, that denes
the universality class of conning strings at level n.

note that with all 2m+1 = 0 for 0  m  n  1, no normalization scale needs to be
introduced to dene the one-loop term s1. in other words, a scale introduced to properly
dene the logarithm in (2.4) would drop out at the end of the computation since the

result does not contain logarithms. as a consequence, in a renormalization analysis as in
[16], there are no anomalous dimensions and the infrared limit 2  0 of vanishing string
tension is characterized by  (2m) = 0 for 0  m  n. the point  = 0 is thus again
an infrared-stable xed point characterized by 2m+1 = 0 for 0  m  n  1, and n + 1
renormalization group invariant numerical coecients 2m, 0  m  n, varying in a range
where there exists a real solution to the gap equation.

the geometric properties of world-sheets in the vicinity of this point can be easily

obtained by decomposing

1

vn (p2)

=

2
2n

n

xk=1

k

p4 + 2

k2 .

(4.6)

this decomposition is always possible since it is determined by a linear system of n equa-

tions for the n numerical coecents k. at this point we can simply apply to each term in

the above decomposition the discussion of [16] and conclude that the infrared point of van-

ishing tension is characterized by long-range orientational order and hausdor dimension

dh = 2 of world-sheets.

we have thus shown that c and the smooth geometric properties are independent of

an innite set of truncations, provided that a solution for the polynomial gap equation

exists. these properties are presumably common to a large class of non-local world-sheet

interactions.
