abstract

in a recent paper, ekstrand proposed a simple expression from which covariant anomaly,
covariant schwinger term and higher covariant chain terms may be computed. we com-
ment on the relation of his result to the earlier work of tsutsui.

1 introduction

there are several methods for the computation of anomalies, anomalous commutators
(schwinger terms) and higher terms of the storazumino chain, both for the consistent
and covariant case. among these are perturbative, functional and algebraic methods [1]
[17] (see [18] for a review).

one particularly wellknown and useful method for the computation of the consistent
anomalous chain terms is the method of descent equations a la stora and zumino [11, 12].
in this framework, all consistent chain terms are computed from the chernsimons form
2n1(a, f ) with the help of some algebraic cohomology methods (here a, f are lie-
t adx, f = da + a2). it turns out that the anomalous
algebra-valued forms, a = aa
chain terms (which are determined up to exact terms) are just the expansion coecients
k

2n1k(v, a, f ) of the shifted chernsimons form

2n1(a + v, f ) =

2n1x

k=0

k

2n1k(v, a, f )

(1)

in powers of v, where v is the ghost eld with ghost number 1.

for the covariant case, an analogous cohomological analysis was performed by tsutsui,
[13]. there, a procedure for computing all the covariant anomalous chain terms was
derived, and an expression in terms of a shifted chernsimons form, analogous to (1),
was given (see (11) below).

recently, a simple expression for a shifted chernsimons form for the covariant chain
terms was proposed by ekstrand [19] (see (6) below). further, he proved that his expres-
sion (i.e., the linear and quadratic expansion terms in v) correctly reproduce the covariant
anomaly and schwinger term. in addition, he noticed that his expression deviates from
the one given by tsutsui, [13], already for the schwinger term (i.e., at order v2).

it is the purpose of this paper to comment on that dierence. we will show that
the algebraic construction of tsutsui, [13], is completely equivalent to the proposed shift
formula of ekstrand, [19], and leads to the same covariant chain terms in all orders. the
mentioned dierence is due to the fact that the explicit shift formula for the covariant
chain terms that was given in [13] is incorrect and does not reproduce the algebraic results
of that paper.

2 covariant chain terms a la ekstrand and tsutsui

as already mentioned, the (non-integrated) consistent anomaly, schwinger term and
higher chain terms are given by the expansion in powers of the ghost of the shifted
chernsimons density

2n1(a + v, f ) = 2n1(a + v, da + a2)

= 2n1(a + v, (d + )(a + v) + (a + v)2)

(2)

where  is the brs operator

a = dv ,

f = [f, v] ,

v = v2

[, d] = 2 = 0

d  d + [a, ]

(3)

(4)

(all commutators are graded w.r.t. form and ghost degree), and the russian formula
[11, 12] ( ba  a + v)

bf ( ba)  (d + )(a + v) + (a + v)2 = da + a2  f (a)

(5)

has been used. it was observed in [19] that it is precisely the occurrence of the brs
operator  in (2) that makes the resulting expressions for the anomaly and schwinger term
non-covariant. therefore, it was proposed in [19] that a similar expression for covariant
chain terms may be found by simply dropping  in (2). further, it was proven that this
proposition is correct, i.e., that the expression (2n1(a, f )  2n1(a, da))

2n1(a + v, d(a + v) + (a + v)2) = 2n1(a + v, d(a + v))

=

2n1x

k=0

k

2n1k(v, dv, a, f )

(6)

has linear and quadratic (in v) contributions that agree with the covariant anomaly and
schwinger term as computed by other methods.

as we want to relate this result (6) to the cohomological computations of [13], we
should briey review the latter. in [13] the following two even (w.r.t. their total grading)
operators m, l are introduced

ma = v , mf = 0

mv = 0 , mdv = v2

la = 0 ,

lf = dv

lv = 0 ,

ldv = v2.

(7)

(8)

both m and l act algebraically on formal polynomials of a, f , v and dv. the consistent
chain terms may be recovered by the action of m alone. indeed,

k

2n1k(v, a, f ) =

1
k!

mk2n1(a, f ).

(9)

on the other hand, both m and l are needed for the computation of the covariant chain
terms. it was proved in [13] that the covariant chain terms will indeed be covariant
provided they are computed as

k

2n1k(v, dv, a, f ) =

1
k!

2

(m  l)k2n1(a, f ).

(10)

as a shift formula that should incorporate all these covariant chain terms, the following
(incorrect) expression was given in [13]

2n1(a + v, f + dv).

(11)

this expression does not reproduce (10) because m and l do not commute. more precisely,
the problem is that the algebraic restrictions of m and l to derivations on (a, f ) (these
restrictions commute with v and dv) do not commute which each other, because only
these restrictions are relevant for the dierence m  l. even if m and l are changed
w.r.t. their action on (v, dv) so that they commute which each other as derivations on
(a, f, v, dv), which may be achieved by choosing mdv = ldv = 2v2 instead of v2 like
in (7), (8), the shift formula (11) would be wrong and the formula (12) below would be
correct.

the correct shift formula that takes this non-commutativity into account and repro-

duces (10), is

exp(v


a

+ dv


f

)2n1(a, f )

(12)

as may be checked easily (see also [17], journal version). here the exponential is de-
ned as its power series, and the derivative is understood in an algebraic sense, e.g.,
v(/a)p (a) = p (a + v)|v1 (i.e., the component of p (a + v) linear in v). this formula
is equal to expression (6) that was proposed in [19], as may be proved easily. indeed,

a +dv 

ev 

f 2n1(a, f ) =

f ev 

e(dv+v2) 
a 2n1(a, f ) =
2n1(a + v, f + dv + v2) =

where we used the bakercampbellhausdor formula in the rst step.

2n1(a + v, d(a + v) + (a + v)2)

(13)

3 summary

we have shown that the shift formula (6) that was proposed in [19] for the generation
of covariant chain terms and the cohomological analysis of [13] lead to identical results
for all chain terms. the discrepancy that was mentioned in [19] is simply due to an
incorrect expression for the shift formula in [13], which is not supported by the (correct)
cohomological computation of the same paper.

our nding further points towards the correctness of the shift formula proposed in
[19] for all covariant chain terms. it should be mentioned at this point, however, that a
physical interpretation of the higher covariant chain terms has not yet been found.
