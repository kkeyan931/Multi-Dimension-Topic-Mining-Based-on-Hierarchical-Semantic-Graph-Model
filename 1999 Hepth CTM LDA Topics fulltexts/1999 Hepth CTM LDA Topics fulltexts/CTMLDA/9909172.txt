elds identied dierent ways building tachyon free theories open . thus, models branes one type (say d9-branes) 7 antibranes (5-antibrane) automatically tachyon free. another possibility consider non-overlapping chan-paton twist matrices coincident branes antibranes. third way place branes antibranes dierent xed points (or dierent wilson lines, t-dual description) internal space. last route one mainly pursue building models let us comment it. one hand kind models indicates attractive possibility breaking supersymmetry. namely, non-supersymmetric antibrane sectors (at xed points) could transmit supersymmetry breaking supersymmetric brane sector (at dier- ent xed points) exchange bulk elds. however, situation subtle. branes (or antibranes) really stuck xed point, able move bulk dynamical brane. since brane-antibrane systems develop net attractive force them, eventually come top annihilate vacuum. thus, brane-antibrane annihilation completely successful antibranes disappear, end stable su- persymmetric vacuum. case, non-supersymmetric models viewed excitations supersymmetric vacuum. interestingly enough situations which, due local obstructions, partial, annihilation all, allowed. appear true stable vacua both, supersymmetric non supersymmetric sectors. following sections use two dierent ways trapping branes: i. tadpole conditions: whenever orientifold planes rr twisted elds charges vanishing, branes must locally introduced order cancel them. depending specic form twist matrices, antibranes also needed cancellation. even though dierent congurations branes antibranes might possible, antibranes cannot completely annihilate. let us briey illustrate idea zz3 orientifold example develop next section. case, tadpole cancellation requires  tr ,9 + 3(tr ,5,l tr

possible. situations adding d5-branes (and anti-d5-branes) xed points may enough achieve twisted tadpole cancellation above. nevertheless, since number an- tibranes required, must present bulk. also congurations branes antibranes distributed among xed points possible. examples sit- uations provided section 4. recall that, whereas supersymmetric case tadpole conditions unique solution, variety non-supersymmetric solutions possible. ii. sitting isolated branes orientifold, orbifold xed points. assume zz3 orbifold twist generators r orientifold action, r zz2 generator, present orientifold

antibrane zz2 xed point, zz3 xed orbifold point. orbifold invariance requires two antibranes zz3 images. antibrane triplet trapped since would need r mirror leave orientifold point dynamical antibrane. hence, triplet non supersymmetric, bounded conguration, three antibranes stable. building full consistent stable non supersymmetric orientifold model require branes also stuck, otherwise attracted antibranes annihilate. fact, appears case zz6 orientifold. section 4.3 provide zz3 example 3-branes 3-antibranes. principle, construction could extended orbifold actions like zz3 zz3, zz7

(59) : 47 5-branes (1, m) xed points get u(1)3 5 gauge group. one nds chiral multiplets (in three copies, one per xed point) transforming like: (3, 1, 1/3)q + (1, 1,1)q + (1, 2,1/2)q + (1, 2, 1/2)q +  (7.10) subindex q refers u(1)3 5 charges. elds include three generations right-handed d-quarks three sets vector-like doublets . latter become massive singlets (55) sectors get vev. 5-branes (1, m) xed points get u(2)3 gauge group. one nds chiral multiplets (in three copies, one per xed point) transforming like: (1, 2,1/2; 2)r + (1, 1, +1; 2)r + (3, 1, 1/3; 2)r + (3, 1,1/3; 2)r (7.11) +  subindex r refers u(1)3 5 charges. sector includes leptons additional weakly interacting particles (as well vector-like sets extra color triplets). now, (55) sector living (1, m) xed points contain adjoint su(2)s get vev along direction give mass triplet anti- triplet pairs corresponding (59) sector. altogether model contains massless level three standard quark-lepton generations plus three sets vector-like right- left-handed extra leptons. section 4.2, one construct related model 5- anti-5- branes stuck xed points. simplest possibility replace 5-branes (1, m) xed points anti-5-branes. put two anti-5-branes ,5 = (i2). meets tadpole conditions leads group sp(2)3. now, spectrum model similar previous one replacing susy spectrum (7.12) following (non-susy) one: (59) : f ermions : scalars : (1, 2,1/2; 2) + (1, 1, +1; 2) +  (3, 1, 1/3; 2) + (3, 1,1/3; 2) +  (7.12) previous situation, sector provides leptons non-susy sector model. 55 sector contains one negative chirality triplet sp(2) groups. 48 7.3 another variant sm write spectrum model discussed beginning section 4 containing su(3) su(2) u(1). n2 = 9, n0 = 1; ni 0 = 1. full gauge group 1 = mi 1 = mi  u(1)3  sp(2)6 u(1)3 (7.13) hypercharge generator dened previous models. spectrum 99 sector: 3  + 3  (7.14) sector incorporate three families left handed quarks right handed u-quarks together three sets higgs elds hu . 5-branes points l0 have: 5l09 sector: 3  (7.15) index semicolon sp(2) representation (one dierent xed point). candidate leptons right handed d-quarks, although doublets sp(2) also. 5-branes points l1 massless spectrum is: 5l19 sector: 3  +3  + (1, 9; 2)] (7.16) subindices q charges respect three u(1)s coming 5-branes. also candidate leptons right handed d-quarks. finally, massless spectrum 55 sector transform sp(2) u(1) l1 xed points as: 55l1 sector: 3  (7.17) contrary previous models, clear model extra (unwanted) triplets doublets get mass, therefore model looks rst 49 sight less interesting phenomenologically, although detailed study may reveal ways making realistic. similar model obtained substituting branes l1 points four anti branes (qi 1 = 1). therefore spectrum except 5l19 sector changed nonsupersymmetric one (with opposite chirality) three copies: f ermions : scalars : (3, 1, 1/3)r + (1, 2, 1/2)r + (1, 2,1/2)r + (1, 1, +1)r +  r] + h.c. (7.18) r charge respect u(1)s coming anti branes. 55l1 also replaces 55l1 sector consists three fermions six scalars (singlets) charge 2r. also includes three extra singlets negative chirality. therefore, may leptons right handed d-quarks non-supersymmetric sector. 7.4 continuous wilson lines. models adjoint represen- tations stressed, contrast happens supersymmetric models, ad- dition antibranes allows several consistent twist matrices wilson lines. particular continuous wilson lines easily included. interesting pos- sibility model building since used reducing gauge groups ranks obtaining adjoint representations. show continuous wilson lines introduced zz3 orientifold discussed section 3. let us consider case n1 = n3 = n4 = n, thus n0 + n2 = 16 n 2.2 rewrite twist matrix discrete wilson line w terms 3n 3n (16 3n) (16 3n) matrices = (diag, 2) diag = diag (in , , 2in ) 2 = diag (in0, in2) w = diag (in , , ; in0, in2) (7.19) (7.20) (7.21) hence, gauge group u(n)3 so(2n0) u(n2) obtained, massless 50 spectrum read 3.12 13 3 + +3 (7.22) (7.23) invariant permutations u(n) gauge groups. moreover, giving appropriate vevs (n, n) multiplets, u(n)3 group break diagonal subgroup su(n)diag u(1), leaving three adjoint representations spectrum. particular su(5), group three 24 massless representations could obtainable. however, since antisymmetric representations 99 gauge group cannot appear crossed sectors, model expected e non chiral. breaking easily achieved considering continuous wilson line type presented . namely, w = wdiag 0 0 1n0+n2 (7.24) 16 16 matrix, wdiag 3n 3n matrix (which acts diag), dened wdiag = (7.25) arbitrary complex numbers block n n matrix. straightforward check (diagwdiag)3 = ci3n c = (3 3a2 + 2a3) also tr (diagw k diag) = 0 k = 0, 1, 2. therefore tr 9(w)k = 2n0 n2 (7.26) (7.27) k = 0, 1, 2. thus, see 6= 0 (and /a 6= 1,2) chosen c = 1. hence, still left complex continuous parameter dening continuous wilson line . 13 must perform replacement n4 n4, due term 2in4 twist matrix 51 performing usual projections, continuous wilson line achieves desired breaking diagonal group keeping three adjoints 99 spectrum. mentioned, chiral generations appear sector.
