abstract

this brief report presents analytical solutions to the equations of motion of a
null string. the background spacetime is a magnetically charged kaluza-klein
black hole. the string coordinates are expanded with the world-sheet velocity
of light as an expansion parameter. it is shown that the zeroth order solutions
can be expressed in terms of elementary functions in an appropriate large
distance approximation. in addition, a class of exact solutions corresponding
to the pollard-gross-perry-sorkin monopole case are also obtained.

string propagation in curved spacetime has been a subject of study in a large number of
papers (for a review, see [1]). to study string interaction with the background spacetime,
the string equations of motion are obtained from the world-sheet action and are solved by
simplifying them with suitable ansatze. it has been suggested by de vega and nicolaidis [2]
that the world-sheet velocity of light c, the velocity of wave propagation along the string,
can be an expansion parameter. the limit of small c corresponds to the strong gravity limit
[24], the length of the string being much larger than the curvature radius.

the formalism developed in the literature [14] is applicable to both cosmic strings
and fundamental strings. however, in the latter case the theory is formulated in higher
dimensions. thus we expect a nontrivial contribution to the string dynamics from the extra
compact dimensions. in other words, it is of interest to study in what way the propagation
of a string probe is aected by these extra dimensions. an attempt in this direction was
made in [5]. the propagation of a null string in a kaluza-klein black hole background was
studied. it was shown that, even at the classical level, the unfolding of an extra dimension
can be seen by the string probe. the kaluza-klein radius, i.e., the radius around which
the extra dimension winds, decreases for a magnetically charged black hole, as viewed by a
null string approaching it. for an electrically charged background, the kaluza-klein radius
behaves in the opposite sense.

in this brief report we extend the work done already in ref. [5] and obtain analytical
counterparts of the solutions presented there for the magnetically charged black hole case, for
small values of the scalar charge. in addition, we show that the problem is solvable exactly for
the case of the pollard-gross-perry-sorkin (pgps) monopole, which has been shown recently
to arise as a solution of a suitable dimensionally reduced string theory [6]. this report is
more or less technical in content. we believe our results may be of some signicance since
analytical solutions are presented for physically interesting higher dimensional backgrounds.

we start with the string world-sheet action [7] given by

s = t0z d dqdetgab

(1)

where gab = g(x)ax bx  is the two-dimensional world-sheet metric;  and  are the
world sheet coordinates and t0 is the string tension.

the classical equations of motion in the gauge gab = (,  )ab (ab is the two- dimensional

minkowskian metric) are given by

describe the motion of a null string [2]. the second equation constrains the motion to be
perpendicular to the string.

where k2 = 4g; x5 is the extra dimension and winds around a circle,  and a represent
the scalar eld and the gauge eld respectively. here g is the four-dimensional metric.

up to constants of integration which depend on  and can be solved to obtain t, r,  and x5
as functions of  . here we have taken the case of a string falling in head-on.

the integrals (13) have been evaluated numerically [5] and inverted to obtain the co-
ordinates as function of  in the limit r >> . however, the quadratures can be reduced
to combinations of elliptical integrals, depending on the relative values of constants 1 and
m(see [10]). the solutions reduce to elementary functions in the region where r is very
large compared to the scalar charge. we take for instance the case when c1 = c3 = 1. the
solutions (up to integration constants which depend on ), retaining terms up to the rst
order in 1, are

horizon but not asymptotically far from the black hole. the negative sign comes because we
consider an in-falling string. the solutions match with the numerical solutions reported in
[5] for the corresponding values of c1 and c3.

the integrals of motion can be solved analytically without resorting to the limit r >> ,
if p = 2m and q = 0, i.e, the pollard-gross-perry-sorkin monopole [11]. the constraint
equation(8) implies that 1 = m or 1 = 2m. in the former case, the metric reduces to
the form reported in ref. [11]. here the time coordinate t is the same as the proper time 
of the string. the solutions are

where  = 1+3c2
. we choose c1 = 1; the condition of reality of the solutions then forces

c3 < 1 and consequently  > 1. the solutions, physically speaking, are the same as those in
the previous case. in the limit when the magnitude of the scalar charge is the same as the
mass of the black hole, the quadratures are solved without expanding in powers of 1/r.

in addition to the above cases, there is another solution (which was not considered in
[8,9]) corresponding to 1 = 2m. the integrals can be solved in terms of elliptical functions,

we have found out analytical solutions to the equations of motion to zeroth order in
the expansion in powers of c. the solutions obtained in the case when r is large compared
to the scalar charge match with those obtained numerically in [5], for corresponding values
of the integration constants c1 and c3. although the results presented for the large r case
are technically the same as the ones obtained in [5], the analytical solutions reveal two new
cases where the problem is solved exactly.

the equations of motion for the electrically charged black hole case do not reduce to
quadratures (see [5]). however, the analytical results obtained in the magnetically charged
case give hope that some qualitative predictions can be made in that case as well. the
optimism comes from the fact that the electrically charged black hole solutions are related

5

to the magnetically charged ones by the duality transformation p  q, q  p and   
[8,9]. these analytical zeroth order results also form the basis for higher order calculations,
work on which is in progress.
