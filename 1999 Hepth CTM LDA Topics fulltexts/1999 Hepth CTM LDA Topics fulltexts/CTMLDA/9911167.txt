lorentzian pp-wave metric however square riemann tensor necessarily van- ishes. note although integrand locally total derivative divergence covariant vector eld thus cannot disregarded counterterm. denitely contributes around non-trivial backgrounds. however, view topological nature, one might imagine absorbing divergence renormalizing topological coupling constant. new result two loops tells us
