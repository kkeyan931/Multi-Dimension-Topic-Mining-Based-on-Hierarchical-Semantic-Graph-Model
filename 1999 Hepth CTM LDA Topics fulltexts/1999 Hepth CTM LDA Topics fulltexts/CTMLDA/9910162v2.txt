abstract

we consider the quantum mechanical analog of the nonlinear sigma model. there are diculties to
completely embed this theory by directly using the batalin, fradkin, fradkina, and tyutin (bfft)
formalism. we show in this paper how the bfft method can be conveniently adapted in order to
achieve a gauge theory that partially embeds the model.

i. introduction

the interest in embedding of systems with nonlinear
constraints has been started with the works by baner-
jee et al. [1]. the general and systematic formalism for
embedding was developed by batalin, fradkin, fradkina,
and tyutin (bfft) [2,3] where systems with second class
constraints [4] are transformed into rst class ones, i.e.
they are embedded into more general (gauge) theories.
this is achieved with the aid of auxiliary variables with
the general rule such that there is one pair of canonical
variables for each second class constraint to be trans-
formed.

the bfft method is quite elegant and the obtainment
of rst class constraints is done in an iterative way. the
rst correction to the constraints is linear in the auxil-
iary variables, the second one is quadratic, and so on.
in the case of systems with just linear constraints, like
chiral-bosons [5], one obtains that just linear corrections
are enough to make them rst class [6,7]. here, we men-
tion that the method is equivalent to express the dynamic
quantities by means of shifted coordinates [8].

however, for systems with nonlinear constraints, the it-
erative process may go beyond the rst correction. this
is a crucial point for the use of the method. this is so
because the rst iterative step may not give a unique so-
lution and one does not know a priori what should be
the most convenient solution we have to choose for the
second step. there are systems where this choice is very
natural and it is feasible to carry out all the steps. we
mention for example the massive yang-mills theory [9].
however, for the nonlinear sigma-model (and cp n 1)
not all the solutions of the rst step lead to a solution in
the second one [10]. the same occurs from the second to
the third step, and so on, making the method not feasible
to be applied. more than that, in the case of the non-
linear sigma model one can not assure that these higher
order solutions actually exist [10]. it is important to em-

phasize that this is not a problem necessarily related to
the method, what may happen is that there might be
no gauge theory that completely embeds the nonlinear
sigma-model.

we shall address to this problem in the present paper.
we are going to study the quantum mechanical analog of
the nonlinear sigma-model. the use of the bfft method
in this model also presents similar diculties in provid-
ing a complete embedding. however, we show how the
method can be conveniently adapted to partially embed-
ding it.

our paper is organized as follows. in sec. ii we make
a brief review of the bfft method and introduce the
general lines of the partially embedding procedure.
in
sec.
iii, for future comparisons, we discuss the con-
straint dynamics of the quantum mechanical analog of
the nonlinear sigma-model, that corresponds to a parti-
cle constrained to move on a n -dimensional sphere and
show the diculties we have for totally embedding it. we
develop the partially embedding of this theory in sec. iv
and discuss the time evolution and the consequences of
the gauge invariance of the model into sec. v. we left
sec. vi for some concluding remarks.

ii. brief review of the bfft formalism

let us take a system described by a hamiltonian hc
in a phase-space with variables (qi, pi) where i runs from
1 to n. it is also supposed that there exist second class
constraints only since this is the case that will be inves-
tigated. denoting them by ta, with a = 1, . . . , m < 2n ,
we have

(cid:8)ta, tb(cid:9) = ab ,

(2.1)

where det(ab) 6= 0.

1

the rst objective is to transform these second-class
constraints into rst-class ones. towards this goal aux-
iliary variables a are introduced, one for each second
class constraint (the connection between the number of
constraints and the new variables in a one-to-one correla-
tion is to keep the same number of the physical degrees of
freedom in the resulting extended theory), which satisfy
a symplectic algebra

(cid:8)a, b(cid:9) = ab ,

(2.2)

where ab is a constant quantity with det (ab) 6= 0. the
rst class constraints are now dened by

ta = ta(q, p; ) ,

and satisfy the boundary condition
ta(q, p; 0) = ta(q, p) .

(2.3)

(2.4)

(cid:8) ta, tb(cid:9) = 0 .

(2.5)

the solution of (2.5) can be achieved by considering

an expansion of ta, as

ta =



xn=0

t (n)
a

,

(2.6)

where t (n)
the boundary condition (2.4) requires that

is a term of order n in . compatibility with

a

t (0)
a = ta .

(2.7)

a characteristic of these new constraints is that they are
assumed to be strongly involutive, i.e.

the replacement of (2.6) into (2.5) leads to a set of recur-
sive relations, one for each coecient of n. we explicitly
list the equations for n = 0, 1, 2,

a , t (0)
(cid:8)t (0)
a , t (1)
(cid:8)t (0)
a , t (2)
(cid:8)t (0)

b (cid:9)() = 0 ,

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

the notations {, }(q,p) and {, }() represent the parts of
the poisson bracket {, } relative to the variables (q, p)
and ().

the above equations are used iteratively to obtain the
corrections t (n) (n  1). equation (2.8) shall give t (1).
with this result and (2.9), one calculates t (2), and so on.
since t (1) is linear in  we may write

t (1)
a = xab(q, p) b .

(2.11)

introducing this expression into (2.8) and using the
boundary condition (2.4), as well as (2.1) and (2.2), we
get

ab + xac cd xbd = 0 .

(2.12)

we notice that this equation contains two unknowns xab
and ab. usually, rst of all ab is chosen in such a way
that the new variables are unconstrained. it is opportune
to mention that it is not always possible to make such a
choice [7]. in consequence, the consistency of the method
requires the introduction of other new variables in order
to transform these constraints also into rst-class. this

2

may lead to an endless process. however, it is important
to emphasize that ab can be xed anyway.

after xing ab, we pass to consider the coecients
xab. they cannot be obtained unambiguously since,
even after xing ab, expression (2.12) leads to less equa-
tions than variables. the choice of xs has therefore to
be done in a convenient way [1].

a

the knowledge of xab permits us to obtain t (1)

a . if xab
does not depend on (q, p), it is easily seen that ta+t (1)
is
already strongly involutive and we succeed in obtaining
ta. this is what happens for systems with linear con-
straints. for nonlinear constraints, on the other hand,
xab becomes variable dependent which necessitates the
analysis to be pursued beyond the rst iterative step. all
the subsequent corrections must be explicitly computed,
the knowledge of t (n)
a (n = 0, 1, 2, ...n) leading to the eval-
uation of t (n+1)
from the recursive relations. once again
the importance of choosing the proper solution for xab
becomes apparent otherwise the series of corrections can-
not be put in a closed form and the expression for the
involutive constraints becomes unintelligible and uninter-
esting.

a

another point in the hamiltonian formalism is that
any dynamic function a(q, p) (for instance, the hamil-
tonian) has also to be properly modied in order to be
strongly involutive with the rst-class constraints ta. de-
noting the modied quantity by a(q, p; ), we then have

a =



xn=0

a(n) ,

(2.15)

(cid:8) ta, a(cid:9) = 0 .

(2.13)

where a(n) is also a term of order n in s. consequently,
compatibility with (2.14) requires that

in addition, a has also to satisfy the boundary condition

a(q, p; 0) = a(q, p) .

(2.14)

to obtain a an expansion analogous to (2.6) is consid-

a(0) = a .

(2.16)

ered,

the combination of (2.6), (2.13) and (2.15) gives

a , a(0)(cid:9)(q,p) +(cid:8)t (1)
(cid:8)t (0)
a , a(1)(cid:9)(q,p) +(cid:8)t (1)
(cid:8)t (0)
+(cid:8)t (2)
a , a(2)(cid:9)(q,p) +(cid:8)t (1)
(cid:8)t (0)
+(cid:8)t (1)
+(cid:8)t (3)

a , a(1)(cid:9)() = 0 ,
a , a(0)(cid:9)(q,p) +(cid:8)t (1)
a , a(1)(cid:9)() = 0 ,
a , a(1)(cid:9)(q,p) +(cid:8)t (2)
a , a(3)(cid:9)() +(cid:8)t (2)
a , a(1)(cid:9)() = 0 ,

a , a(2)(cid:9)()

(2.17)

(2.18)

(2.19)

which correspond to the coecients of the powers 0, 1, 2, etc., respectively. the expression (2.17) above gives us
a(1)

a(1) =  a ab x bc(cid:8)tc, a(cid:9) ,

(2.20)

where ab and x ab are the inverses of ab and xab.

it was earlier seen that ta + t (1)

a was strongly involutive if the coecients xab do not depend on (q, p). however,
the same argument does not necessarily apply in this case. usually we have to calculate other corrections to obtain
the nal a. let us discuss how this can be systematically done. the correction a(2) comes from equation (2.18), that
we conveniently rewrite as

a , a(2)(cid:9)() =  g(1)
(cid:8)t (1)

a ,

g(1)

a = (cid:8)ta, a(1)(cid:9)(q,p) +(cid:8)t (1)

a , a(cid:9)(q,p) +(cid:8)t (2)

a , a(1)(cid:9)() .

where

thus

a(2) = 

1
2

a ab x bc g(1)

c

in the same way, other terms can be obtained. the nal general expression reads

a(n+1) =

the partially embedding procedure we are going to
apply consists in transforming into rst-class just part
of the constraints. let us suppose we take m  among
the m second-class constraints to be converted into rst-
class. there are two general steps to be done. the rst
one is to achieve the strong involutive algebra for these
constraints, namely,

in the rst equation above we are using a short notation.
we do it from now on where there is no misunderstand-
ing. derivating the rst of the equations above twice
with respect to the evolution parameter and using the
second equation, we see that  =  q2/q2, and so we get
the expected equation of motion for a particle moving on
a n -dimensional sphere:

{ ta, tb} = 0

a, b = 1, . . . , m 

(2.26)

by introducing m  variables a
of auxiliary variables and
the same steps of the bfft formalism. consequently,
in the partially embedding formalism we work with less
auxiliary variables than in the full procedure. of course,
the choice of what constraints we intend to convert into
rst-class may be a crucial point for the success of the
method.

the fact of having achieved a strong involutive alge-
bra for some of the constraints does not necessarily means
that these constraints are rst-class. we have also to con-
vert the remaining m  m  ones in order to have involu-
tive algebras with all the ta . this is the second general
step we have talked above and it is achieved by treating
the remaining constraints in a similar way of the quan-
tity a that appears in (2.13). denoting the remaining
second-class constraints by ta, with a = 1, . . . m  m ,
we would have to obtain ta(q, p, ) in the same lines
that a was done in the bfft formalism. in this way

{ ta, ta} = 0 ,

(2.27)

but, in general, the matrix ab = { ta, tb} will be
nonsingular, which means that the tas remain second-
class

finally we mention that the strong involutive hamil-
tonian are obtained in the same way as ta. further
details will be displayed when we use the formalism in
the example we are going to consider.

qi =

(3.3)

let us now consider this theory in the canonical formal-
ism. the canonical hamiltonian corresponding to (3.1)
reads

hc =

p2

 (q2  1) ,

(3.4)

where pi is the canonical conjugated momentum to qi.
using the dirac constraint formalism [4] we obtain that
the constraints of this theory are

t1 = q2  1 ,
t2 = q.p ,
t3 = p ,
t4 =  q2 + p2 ,

(3.5)

where p is the canonical conjugated momentum to .
these constraints are second class. in fact, for the anti-
symmetric quantities ab given by (2.1), we have

12 = 2 q2 ,
14 = 4 q.p ,
24 = 2  q2 + 2 p2 ,
34 =  q2 ,

the dirac brackets between any two quantities a and

b is constructed in the usual way,

the motion of a particle on a n -dimensional sphere of

as can be easily veried, the euler-lagrange equations
for  and qi are respectively given by

q2  1 = 0 ,
qi  qi = 0 .

(3.2)

and since any quantity has null dirac brackets with any
one of the t s, the time evolution generated by hc, or by
any of its extensions by adding to it terms such as ata,
gives the same result. actually, by considering the form
of the constraints, we note that (3.4) can be written as

hc =   t1 +

1

(3.8)

(3.9)

the system above cannot be univocally solved. it con-
tains sixteen variables in just six equations. in cases like
this we examine the possibility of guring out a solution
where the rst linear correction for the constrains could
lead to a strongly involutive algebra. this is achieved if
besides eq. (2.14) the equations

{ta, xbc} + {xac, tb} = 0
{xac, xbd} + {xad, xbc} = 0

(3.12)

which give, on the constraint surface, the same dynam-
ics as the one generated by the euler-lagrange equations
(3.2).

are also satised. since the coecients xab depend on
coordinates and momenta, there is no choice where this
can be achieved.

let us now try to use the full bfft method for the
present theory in order to see the diculties for embed-
ding it. the use of the method requires the introduction
of four coordinates a. we consider them such that 3
and 4 are the momenta conjugated to 1 and 2, respec-
tively. hence, the matrix (ab) given by (2.2) reads

(ab) = 


0 1 0
0
0
0 0 1
1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0

.




(3.10)

the combination of (2.13), (2.14), (3.3), and (3.10) leads
to the set of equations

x11x23 + x12x24  x13x21  x14x22 = 2q2 ,
x11x33 + x12x34  x13x31  x14x32 = 0 ,
x11x43 + x12x44  x13x41  x14x42 = 4q.p ,
x21x33 + x22x34  x23x31  x24x32 = 0 ,
x21x43 + x22x44  x23x41  x24x42 = 2q2  2p2 ,
x31x43 + x32x44  x33x41  x34x42 = q2 .

(3.11)

in order to see the problem of going to the next steps

of the method, let us make a choice that solves (3.11):

x11 = 0, x12 = 0, x13 = 2, x14 = q.p,
x21 = q2, x22 = 0, x23 = 0, x24 = 1
2 p2,
x31 = 0, x32 = 0, x33 = 0, x34 =  1
x41 = 0, x42 = 4, x43 = 2, x44 = 0.

4 q2,

(3.13)

with this choice we have the following rst-order correc-
tion for the constraints

t (1)
1 = 2 3 + q.p 4 ,
t (1)
2 = q.q 1 +

p.p 4 ,

sion (2.11),which leads to the following set of equations

as one observes, this system may have many solutions.
this can be veried if one writes t (2)
as xabc bc. so
each t (2)
has sixteen terms and the six equations (3.15)
will involve ninety six quantities to be xed. for any
choice we make, this problem will be enlarged and en-
larged at each step of the method.

we then observe that it is not feasible to infer what
is the general rule for the corrections and, consequently,
this discard any possibility of obtaining a closed solution.
we may conclude that the use of full bfft method to
this problem is very tedious and uninteresting.

hence, the rst correction for t4 reads

4 = 2(cid:16) 
t (1)

p2

q2(cid:17)  2p.q  .

iv. using the partially embedding

formalism

considering again the set of constraints (3.5), let us
just convert t1 and t2 into rst class and let t3 and t4
as second class constraints. then instead of two pair of
canonical coordinated we introduce just one, that we sim-
ply denote by 1 =  and 2 = . from the solutions of
the rst step of the bfft method we make an analogous
choice of banerjee et al. [1]

t1 = t1 + t (1)
t2 = t2 + t (1)

1 = q2  1 + 2 ,
2 = q.p  q2 ,

giving

{ t1, t2} = 0 .

(4.1)

(4.2)

it is opportune to mention that this choice, which
would correspond to x11 = 2 and x23 = q.q of the
full bfft method is not compatible with any solution
for the set of equations given by (3.11).

of course, the result given by (4.2) does not necessar-
ily means that t1 and t2 are rst class. they also have
to have zero poisson brackets, on the constraint surface,
with the remaining constraints. we notice that this is
actually true for the constraint t3, but it is not for t4.
let us then conveniently modify the constraint t4 in or-
der to have zero poisson brackets with t1 and t2. as
it was mentioned in sec. ii, this can be achieved in the
same framework of the bfft formalism by taking t4 as
the quantity a of eq. (2.13). so, the general expression
for the rst correction for t4 should be

t (1)
4 =  a

ab x bc {tc, t4} ,

(4.3)

using (2.21)(2.25) we calculate other corrections for t4.
we list some of them below

t (2)

4 = (cid:16) 2pi

t (3)
4 = 

,

2

q2  + qi (cid:17)2
q2 (cid:16) 2pi
q4 (cid:16) 2pi

q2  + qi (cid:17)2
q2  + qi (cid:17)2

.

42

t (4)
4 =

,

(4.6)

from these results we can infer that the general correc-
tion t (n)

, for n  2, should be

4

4 = (cid:16)
t (n)

2

q2(cid:17)n2(cid:16) 2pi

q2  + qi (cid:17)2

.

(4.7)

we then see that the partially embedding procedure,
contrarily to the use of the full bfft method, permitted
us to infer the general rule for all the corrections. more
than that, we can also show that the sum of all these
terms to obtain t4 can be cast in a closed form,
t4 =  q2 + p2 + 2   2 pi(cid:16) pi
q2  + qi (cid:17)
q2(cid:17)n
xn=0(cid:16)
q2(cid:17)   2 p.q

=  q2 + p2 + 2(cid:16)

q2  + qi (cid:17)2(cid:16)1 +

q2(cid:17)1

.

this constraint can be further rewritten as

t4 = (cid:16)1 +

2

q2(cid:17)1

(cid:0)pi  qi(cid:1)2

+ (cid:0)q2 + 2(cid:1) .

(4.9)

it is just a matter of algebraic work to check that t1
and t2 are actually rst class, whereas t3 = t3 = p and
t4 are second class.

where the indices a, b, c = 1, 2 just correspond to the
constraints t1 and t2, and ab and x ab
are the inverse

using the partially embedding procedure in terms of
the rst-class constraints t1 and t2 we directly obtain

6

the partially embedding hamiltonian hc that resembles
the form of the hamiltonian hc given by (3.8), namely

hc =   t1 +

t4

 .

(4.10)

it is important to emphasize that it generates a consis-
tent time evolution for each one of the constraints ta.

v. time evolution and gauge

invariance

the rst order lagrangian for the theory described in

the last section reads

l = p  q +   + p   h ,

(5.1)

where h is the total hamiltonian

h = hc + a ta .

(5.2)

this theory must be invariant under the transforma-
tions generated by the rst-class constraints. considering
that y represents any one of the canonical coordinates of
the system, we have

y = a{y, ta}d ,

is the parameter characteristic of the gauge

transformation generated by the rst-class constraint ta.
the presence of the dirac brackets here is to consistently
eliminate the constraints ta. we thus obtain

qi = 2 qi ,
pi =  2 1qi  2(pi  2qi) ,
 =  2q2 ,
 =  2 1 ,
 = 0 ,
p = 0 .

(5.4)

the gauge invariance of the corresponding action is then
achieved if the lagrange multipliers a transform as

a =  a .

(5.5)

let us nally consider the equations of motion gener-
ated by the total hamiltonian (5.2). an important point
regarding the embedding procedure is that the obtained
theory, even though having more symmetries than the
initial one, does not change its physics. in other words,
the theory described by the total hamiltonian h must de-
scribe a particle moving on a sphere of radius one. if the
partially embedding we have developed till now makes
sense, this point has necessarily to be veried.

the general expression for the time evolution of any

canonical quantity, on the constraint surface, is

y = {y, h}d ,

= 

1
2

{y, }d + (  1){ t1, y}d  2{ t2, y}d . (5.6)

this leads, after some simplications, to the equations of
motion

q2

(q2 + 2)2(cid:16)pi  2qi(cid:17)  2qi ,

qi = (cid:16)2 t1 + 1(cid:17)
pi =  qi + qi + 2(pi  qi)  (2 t1 + 1)(cid:16) pk + qk
q2 + 2 (cid:17)2

 = 0 ,
p = 0 ,

 =  (2 t1 + 1)

q2

(q2 + 2)2 + 2 q2 (p.q  q2)  0 ,
q2 + 2(cid:20)(cid:16) pi  qi
q2  (cid:21) + 2( + 1)  0.

it is a matter of algebraic work to show that the above equations of motion are consistent with the gauge trans-
dt , ]y = 0 for any y. so gauge transformed variables satisfy the same

formations dened in (5.3) in the sense that [ d
equations of motion as the original ones.

the combination of the eqs. (5.7) and (5.8) leads to

d

dt(cid:16) qi + 2qi(cid:17) = (cid:20)2 +

2 t2(2 t1 + 1)
(q2 + 2)2 (cid:21)( qi + 2qi)

q2 ( qk + 2qk)2 qi .

as can be veried, the above equation is also consis-
tent with the gauge transformations. now, under the
constraint surface, it reduces trivially to

d
dt

( qi + 2qi) = 2( qi + 2qi) 

1
q2 ( qk + 2qk)2qi ,

(5.14)

which obviously reproduces (3.3) with the gauge choice
2 = 0, showing in this way that the partial embedding
procedure introduces gauge degrees of freedom but keeps
the same physical content, as it should be.

to conclude, let us recall the physical meaning of some
embedding results found in literature by using the bfft
formalism. for the simplest case where the rst class
constraints of the embedding theory are linear in the
new variables of the extended space, like chiral-bosons
[57] and abelian massive vector theory [2,3], the phys-
ical meaning is that the result is invariant for a shift of
coordinates [8]. for the case where constraints are not
linear in these variables, like the non-abelian massive
vector theory [9], the embedding theory is equivalent to
the generalized stuckelberg formalism [11]. the natural
question now is related to the physical meaning of the re-
sult expressed by the equation of motion given by (5.14).
we can show that the result above and the initial one
corresponding to a particle on a n -sphere described by
coordinates qi satisfying (3.3) are linked by a scale trans-
formation.
in fact, performing a scale transformation
over the coordinates qi in such a way that

qi = eqi ,

(5.15)

one directly veries that (3.3) leads to

d
dt

( qi  qi) = ( qi  qi) 

1
q2 ( qk  qk)2qi .
(5.16)

by comparing (5.16) and (5.14) we see that 2 plays the
rule of minus the time derivative of the scale factor ,
when the qs of (5.14) are interpreted as the qs of (5.16).
this could also be directly seen from eqs. (5.1) and (5.4),
namely, qi = 2qi and 2 =  2. so we see that in
some sense the eect of the embedding procedure on the
hamiltonian system describing the n dimensional rotor
is related to a scale transformation. fixing the gauge
corresponds to make the scale factor constant over the
time, as expected.

vi. conclusion

in this work we have considered the quantum mechan-
ical analog of the nonlinear sigma-model, corresponding
to a particle constrained to move on a n -dimensional
sphere of unit radius. the hamiltonian treatment of this
model generates four second class constraints. the em-
bedding of this theory by using the bfft formalism runs
into diculties. this is so because it is not natural the
choice of solution in each step of the method and, con-
sequently, one cannot infer the general rule for higher
contributions. this makes the formalism uninteresting
and not feasible to be applied, because we would have
to get an innite number of corrections to analyze the
embedded theory. on the other hand, we have shown
that the same bfft method can be conveniently used
in order to embed the theory in a partial way, where just
two of the four constraints are converted into rst-class.
we have shown that, contrarily to the attempt of us-
ing the full method, all the steps of the corrections are
naturally obtained and, more than that, can be cast in
a closed form. finally, we have discussed the dynamics
and the physical meaning of the embedded theory. we
have shown that it corresponds to a time dependent scale
transformation of coordinates, suggesting us some equiv-
alence with a geometrical conformal formulation.
