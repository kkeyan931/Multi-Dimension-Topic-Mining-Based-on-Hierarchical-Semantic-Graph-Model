abstract

we show that t-duality can be broken by nonperturbative eects in string coupling.
the t-duality in question is that of the 2-torus when the heterotic string is compactied
on k3t 2. this case is compared carefully to a situation where t-duality appears to
work. a holonomy argument is presented to show that t-dualities (and general u-
dualities) should only be expected for large amounts of supersymmetry. this breaking
of r  1/r symmetry raises some interesting questions in string theory which we
discuss. finally we discuss how the classical modular group of a 2-torus appears to be
broken too.

introduction

r  1/r symmetry, the statement that a string theory compactied on a circle of radius r
is isomorphic to a string compactied on a circle of radius 1/r, is the most basic instance
of t-duality.
it is not only a prime example of inherently stringy physics but also an
extremely useful tool in studying the theory. it has been used to argue for the existence of
minimal distances in string theory and, applied in more complicated situations, to derive
various properties of the theory. in these applications it is often necessary to assume that
t-duality is an exact symmetry of string theory. the justication of r  1/r symmetry
comes from conformal eld theory. probably the neatest argument is that if one looks at a
conformal eld theory corresponding to a string on a circle of radius r, then at r = 1 (in
suitable units) one gets an extra su(2) symmetry which may be used to identify the marginal
operator which decreases r with the marginal operator which increases r (see, e.g., [1]). in
compactication on t 2 the t-duality is extended to an sl(2, z) symmetry acting on the
volume and background b-eld.

the problem with the argument is that it ignores nonperturbative eects in the string
coupling constant. in this paper we will show how nonperturbative eects can modify the
conclusion when the string coupling is nonzero. our general conclusion is that t-duality-like
arguments work generally only when there is a lot of supersymmetry. here we will look at
the heterotic string compactied on a product of a k3 surface and a 2-torus leading to an
n = 2 theory in four dimensions. heterotic strings compactied on t 2 exhibit t-duality
at any value of the string coupling, as we will show. at the level of conformal eld theory
the correlation functions factorize into products of correlators associated to one or the other
factor of the compactication space, so the presence of k3 is irrelevant to the issue of t-
duality for t 2. we will show that this is not true nonperturbatively. the 2-torus in this
context appears to be the most supersymmetric case for a failure of t-duality and so will be
the easiest to analyze.

in many ways the essential facts of this paper have been known to many people for a
few years now. that is, something peculiar happens to t-duality when a heterotic string is
compactied on k3t 2. this was studied in particular in [24] for example. our purpose
here is to emphasize that this implies a basic failure of t-duality in a general setting  a
fact which does not appear to have been widely appreciated.

we should immediately clarify precisely what we mean when we say that t-duality is
broken. what we do not mean is that we consider the string theory on a circle of radius r
and then the same string theory on a circle of radius 1/r and discover that they are dierent.
the situation is more awkward than this because it is dicult to say unambiguously how to
measure the radius of a circle in this context.

what we can describe unambiguously is the moduli space of heterotic string theories
compactied on a given spacetime. we can then follow the philosophy developed in study-
ing moduli spaces of calabiyau threefolds [57]. we attempt to assign a geometrical

1

interpretation in terms of parameters such as the sizes of circles to points in the moduli
space. one begins with some large radius (and/or weak coupling) region where one un-
derstands the system classically and then one integrates along paths in the moduli space
assigning parameters to all the points in the moduli space. the problem with this method
is that monodromies within the moduli space force branch cuts to be made. in general one
nds that this process requires choices, so that the parameters are not uniquely determined
by the moduli. one may try to remove these monodromies by forming a teichmuller space
which will cover this moduli space. if all goes well then the new copies of the fundamental
region will tessellate naturally to form a cover giving some parameter space. an example
where this fails was rst recognized for measuring the volume of the quintic threefold in [5]
(see gure 5.2 of that paper in particular).

it is important to note that one may always form the teichmuller space and obtain an
associated (usually very large) modular group. indeed this was the approach taken in [2] for
example and one may also obtain useful information about the theory if this path is taken
(see [4] for example). the point we wish to emphasize here however is that this teichmuller
space is often physically meaningless in the usual sense.

what conditions need to hold in order for a physical interpretation to survive? in this
paper we propose the following. the parameter space must contain a limiting semiclassical
open region corresponding to weakly coupled strings and large radii. this region should
be unique up to the action of duality transformations which can be determined from the
semiclassical approximation to the system. in the case at hand this would mean that the
large-radius, weak-coupling limit of a t 2 compactication must be unique up to b  b + 1.
this requirement is quite restrictive as we shall see.

we believe this is a very reasonable denition for t-duality to respect. one could not
seriously propose that there is a symmetry in the universe which identies a circle of radius
1cm with a circle of radius 2cm  we may use a ruler to measure the dierence! an important
aspect of t-dualities is that large distances are unique. it is precisely this uniqueness which
is lost if we allow an arbitrary cover of the moduli space to act as our teichmuller space.

we will endeavour to show that the moduli space for the 2-torus in the context above
does not admit a covering with this property and so there is no t-duality group. note that
r  1/r symmetry is not literally broken. instead what is true is that for r of order one
or smaller, there is no natural way to associate a size r to a given point in moduli space.
in particular, the statement of t-duality thus loses its content.

the nonperturbative corrections responsible for modifying the structure of the moduli
space and rendering it inconsistent with t-duality are presumably represented by vebrane
instantons wrapping the k3 as well as one of the cycles of the torus. we do not know
at present how to compute these corrections explicitly.
instead, we use a dual type iia
description of the model. in this description, the heterotic dilaton is mapped to a kahler
modulus and the corrections in question are generated by world-sheet instantons whose eect
is readily computed by mirror symmetry.

2

in the context of this dual model the issue of t-duality breaking becomes that of bre-
wise duality. the idea is that one has a calabiyau space, x, which is an f -bration for
some bre f which is also a calabiyau space. if some duality statement is true for each f
can it be extended to a duality of x? in section 2 we give an example where it can and in
section 3 we give an example where it cannot. by heterotic/type ii string duality the latter
case implies a failure of t-duality. the essential dierence between sections 2 and 3 is that
in former we show that we are required to t a nite number of fundamental domains of the
moduli space into a part of the teichmuller space with innite area while in the later case
we would be required to t an innite number of fundamental domains of the moduli space
into a part of the teichmuller space with nite area.

in section 4 we will discuss the consequences of broken dualities. in particular we will
set a general description of how dualities are natural only when there is a large amount of
supersymmetry. we propose that the clearest interpretation of the results in this paper is
that whether a circle respects t-duality in string theory depends on the context of the circle.
we will also note the possibly alarming conclusion that the classical sl(2, z) modular group
of the moduli space of complex structures on a torus is also probably broken (in the same
sense).

2 unbroken t-duality

2.1 a two parameter k3 surface

in this section we will deal with a type iia string compactied on a k3 surface which is
an elliptic bration with section. we wish to see that the sl(2, z) symmetry of the elliptic
bre can be seen in the moduli space of the k3 surface.

an f-theory argument shows that this is equivalent to saying that the sl(2, z) t-duality
acting on the moduli space of complexied kahler forms is unaected by the value of the
complex structure modulus (or, equally, the mirror of this statement). note that the heterotic
dilaton in eight dimensions lives in a separate r factor of the moduli space and will certainly
not aect any t-duality statements.

we know from narain [8] that the moduli space required for a heterotic string on t 2

(with the wilson lines switched o) is

m0 = o(2,2)\ o(2, 2)/(o(2)  o(2)),

(1)

where 2,2 = u  u and u is the usual hyperbolic lattice of signature (1, 1). this space
can be thought of as the grassmannian of space-like 2-planes in r2,2 where we care only
about the orientation of the 2-planes relative to the lattice 2,2.

one may explicitly map sl(2, r)  sl(2, r) to o(2, 2) by writing a vector (x1, x2, x3, x4)

3

in r2,2 as

m = (cid:18)x1 x3

x4 x2(cid:19) ,

and then let (a, b)  sl(2, r)  sl(2, r) act on this vector as

(a, b) : m  amb1.

(2)

(3)

(note that (1, 1) maps to the identity.)

this allows us to rewrite m0 in (1) in terms of two copies of the upper-half plane
sl(2, r)/ u(1). the modular group o(2,2) then generates two copies of sl(2, z)  each
acting on its upper-half plane, a mirror z2 which exchanges the upper-half planes, and
a conjugation z2 which acts as (minus) complex conjugation on both upper-half planes
simultaneously. one can then interpret one upper-half plane as representing the complex
structure,  , of the 2-torus and the other upper-half plane as representing the b-eld and
kahler form,  = b + ij, of the torus [9]. equivalently we may describe this moduli space as
two copies of the j-line divided by exchange and complex conjugation. we denote coordinates
on the two j-lines by j1 and j2.

via the usual f-theory argument [10] the heterotic string on t 2 is dual to f-theory (or
the type iia string in some limit) on a k3 surface, s.1 we will map the moduli space
explicitly for the case of an algebraic k3 surface written as a hypersurface in a toric variety.
let us consider the surface s given by

x2
0 + x3

1 + x12

2 + x12

3 + x0x1x2x3 + x6

2x6
3,

(4)

in p3
{6,4,1,1}/z6, where we divide by the z6 action generated by (x0, x1, x2, x3) 7 (x0, x1,
ei/6x2, ei/6x3).2 this k3 surface is mirror via the usual arguments [11, 12] to an elliptic
k3 surface with a section. that is, s and s are a mirror pair in the sense of algebraic
k3 surfaces [1214]. we should now be able to map out the desired moduli space, m0 by
varying  and  in (4), i.e., by varying the complex structure of s.

we want to explicitly map the coordinates (, ) to the two copies of the j-line we saw
above. this has already been done in [15, 16] (see also [17]). let us review this construction
so that we may compare some details to that of the calabiyau threefold in the next section.
the structure is most easily seen by nding the interesting points in the moduli space. as
is well-known, at certain points in the moduli space we obtain enhanced gauge symmetries.
in the language of the grassmannian (1) this occurs when lattice elements of length squared

1there is a very awkward z2 identication problem which we will ignore for the sake of exposition. the
complex conjugation symmetry of m0 must be treated carefully in the type iia picture. we will ignore this
subtlety for the sake of exposition.

2although this action looks like it generates z12, dont forget that the weighted projective identication

means that (x0, x1, x2, x3) = (x0, x1, x2, x3).

2 are orthogonal to the space-like 2-plane. let us suppose that we force the 2-plane to be
orthogonal to such a lattice element. the result is that the 2-plane now varies in the space
2,1 z r, where 2,1 = u  l(2) and l(2) is a one-dimensional lattice whose generator
has length squared 2. that is, the moduli space within m0 where the theory has a gauge
symmetry of at least su(2) is given by

msu(2) = o(2,1)\ o(2, 1)/(o(2)  o(1)).

(5)

in the same way that o(2, 2) is mapped to sl(2, r)  sl(2, r), we may map o(2, 1) to
sl(2, r) by writing

m = (cid:18)x1

x3 x1(cid:19) ,

x2

and letting a  sl(2, r) act as

a : m  ama1.

(6)

(7)

the reader may also check that (up to a z2 corresponding to complex conjugation) o(2,1) =
sl(2, z).

thus we may embed msu(2) into m0 by setting a = b.

in other words j1 = j2 in
terms of the two j-lines. actually the fact that o(2,2) acts transitively on vectors of length
squared 2 shows that we have an enhanced gauge symmetry (of at least su(2)) if and only
if j1 = j2.

in terms of s in the form (4) we have an enhanced gauge symmetry when  and  are
tuned to produce a canonical singularity. this happens when the discriminant, , of the
equation vanishes. this is given by3

 = (  2)( + 2)(432  6 + 864)(432  6  864).

(8)

one may also argue that  = k(j1  j2)2, where k is some constant, as follows. as we said
above we only get enhanced gauge symmetry when j1 = j2. one argues that the power is
2 by saying that any odd power would violate the j1  j2 symmetry and any power higher
than 2 would imply that the degeneration of s when  = 0 could never be suitably generic.
we also have further enhanced gauge symmetry. namely there is a single point j1 = j2 =
0 where we have su(3) and a single point j1 = j2 = 1728 where we have su(2)su(2). with
a bit of algebra we may nd the corresponding values for  and . all said, our equations
are satised with k = 1 by making j1 and j2 the roots of

j2  (6  4322 + 1728) j + 12 = 0.

(9)

3note that there are some identications to be made within the (, ) plane. this discriminant does not

really have four components.

5

if the reader is not fully convinced of this map between (, ) and the j-lines, one may
check that the atness condition is satised for the special coordinates  and  . we will
do this next. for a nice account of what is meant by special coordinates we refer to [18].
the special coordinates are of particular interest to us because these specify length
are should parameterize any natural teichmuller space. let us perform the usual analysis of
converting algebraic coordinates (, ) into special, or at coordinates as in [5,6,19]. this
is a rather technical process but it is thoroughly treated in the literature. our approach is
closest to [7]. introducing variables

z =


6 ,

y =

we obtain the hypergeometric partial dierential operators

z = z

y = (cid:18)y

(11)

the monomial-divisor mirror map of [20] tells us that s is an elliptic bration with a section
and that the section goes to innite size as y  0 and the bre goes to innite size as z  0.
there is a unique solution of z(z, y) = y(z, y) = 0 which is equal to 1 at the origin.
call this 0. we also have solutions z and y which behave asymptotically as log(z) and
log(y) as we approach the origin. the at coordinates are then ratios of these solutions in
the usual way. let us put

qz = exp(cid:18)z

0(cid:19) ,

qy = exp(cid:18)y

0(cid:19) .

(12)

(just as q is used conventionally to denote exp(2i ).) we then have a power series solution
from the hypergeometric system:

qz = z  zy + 312z2  zy2  192z2y + 107604z3 + . . .
qy = y + 120zy + 2y2 + 41580yz2 + 5y3 + . . .

explicit computation then shows order by order that this is consistent with (9) with

j1 = j(qz)
j2 = j(qzqy),

(13)

(14)

where j(q) is the usual j-function expansion given by q1 + 744 + 196884q + o(q2). this
veries that (9) is correct. see [15] for an explicit proof of this.

2.2 fibre-wise t-duality

now we wish to analyze the same two parameter model from the point of view of the elliptic
bration of the k3 surface s. we want to know if sl(2, z) modular group of the elliptic
bre can be seen in the moduli space of s. first let us take the area of section to be huge,
y  0. in this limit, the moduli properties of s are basically that of its bre. putting y = 0
we obtain

j1 = j(qz) =

1

z(1  432z)

,

(15)

and j2 = .
it is very important to note that varying z gives us a double cover of the
j1-line. in particular, if we plot the shape of fundamental region in terms of at coordinates
(as discussed in [57]) we obtain the shaded area of gure 1. this region is h/0(2), where
h is the upper-half plane. this means that there is a non-toric z2 symmetry acting on s
which will identify the two fundamental regions of h/ sl(2, z) in gure 1.

in terms of the mirror s, taking y  0 takes   . s is an elliptic k3 surface with a
section and in this limit the complex structure of the bre becomes constant. the remaining
variation of complex structure of s is therefore the variation of the complex structure of this
constant bre. a similar story was was discussed in [21].

finding the moduli space of an elliptic curve via toric varieties is always going to be
plagued by nding multiple covers of the j-line because of non-toric symmetries. most
simple families of elliptic curves that one tries to write down tend to have xed rational
points. see [22] for a discussion of such problems. this level structure forces the nave
moduli space to be a multiple cover of the j-line. this helps us out in the toric case as we
now explain.

in the general approach of candelas et al. [5] in analyzing a one parameter case, the
moduli space will always look like a rational curve with 3 special points. to use the language

7

figure 2: the domain when  = ic.

of the quintic threefold, one point will be large complex structure another will be an
orbifold-like point and a third, which marks the division between the rst two phases, is a
conifold-like point. the problem is that an elliptic curve doesnt have a conifold-like point
 any singular complex structure must be the large complex structure. thus one must
have a non-toric symmetry identifying the putative conifold point with the large complex
structure point. in our example this must identify the conifold  = 0 with  = i, i.e.,
it is the   1/ symmetry. it is this non-toric discrete symmetry which produces the
multiple cover of the j-line above.

now the main question we wish to ask is what happens to gure 1 if we allow y to be
nonzero? from (15) the point given by  = 0 in gure 1 corresponds to z = 1/432. this is
on the discriminant as it corresponds to j1 = j2 = . for general y, the relevant part of the
discriminant becomes

(432 z  1)2  8642 yz2 = 0.

(16)

thus, as y is switched on, the point z = 1/432 splits into two nearby points (up to extra
identications). how can we understand this in terms of at coordinates?

the question of what a slice of constant y in the moduli space corresponds to in terms of
the elliptic curve is awkward. recall that setting y = 0 put j2 =  and so  = i. suppose
instead we x  to be ic for some large but nite c. what does the fundamental region for
 then look like? because of the mirror map    , we are free to x im( )  im(). this
chops o the top of the fundamental region. this will turn gure 1 into gure 2.

now the domain for y constant, as opposed to j2 constant, wont quite look like gure 2
but the coarse structure should be about right. thus we see how the point at the end of the
cusp at  = 0 in gure 1 gets split and moves up a little in gure 2. (we should also point
out that these supposed two points are actually identied by the sl(2, z) action in gure
2.) when y is nonzero, a solution of z satisfying (16) gives a z2-orbifold point on s. thus

8

this corresponds to an su(2) gauge symmetry (in the eight-dimensional theory in question)
and this point in the moduli space is a z2 orbifold point.

the important point is that nothing catastrophic happens to the sl(2, z) action as we
switch on y. we just pick up an extra z2 into the modular group. we know that our moduli
space is of the form of a global quotient (1) and so no matter what kind of complex slice of
the moduli space we take, we will always see some t-duality group acting nicely on some
slice of the teichmuller space. in the heterotic string point of view, the t-duality group of
the torus persists.

3 broken t-duality

we now wish to discuss along parallel lines the case of a heterotic string compactied on
k3t 2. to this end, we need to replace the k3 surface s with a calabiyau threefold x.
the space x is now a k3-bration. the bre has a t-duality which can be shown to be
sl(2, z) (which up to z2 factors is o(1,2)  o(4,20)  the full t-duality group of a k3
surface). this sl(2, z) will not survive to the full calabiyau threefold moduli space. this
shows that the t-duality of the heterotic string is destroyed at nonzero string coupling.

the toric data for x will be very similar to that of s, and x will again have two

deformations of the b-eld and kahler form. let x be given by

x2
0 + x6

1 + x6

3x6
4,

2 + x12

3 + x12

4 + x0x1x2x3x4 + x6

in p3

{6,2,2,1,1}/g, where we divide by the g = z6  z6  z2 action generated by

(x0, x1, x2, x3, x4) 7 (x0, x1, x2, ei/6x3, ei/6x4)
(x0, x1, x2, x3, x4) 7 (x0, x1, ei/3x2, x3, ei/3x4)
(x0, x1, x2, x3, x4) 7 (x0, ei/3x1, x2, x3, ei/3x4).

(17)

(18)

this calabiyau threefold and its mirror x have been studied extensively [23]. in particular
kachru and vafa [24] conjectured that the type iia string on x is dual to the heterotic string
on sh  eh where sh is a k3 surface and eh is an elliptic curve. the string theory on eh
is frozen along  =  by higgsing the enhanced su(2) symmetry we saw in the last section.
thus the moduli space of the string on eh should be just a single copy of the j-line. there
is considerable evidence to support this conjecture (for example [2426]).

now as before we may introduce

z =


6 ,

y =

1
2 ,

(19)

9

and we obtain the hypergeometric partial dierential operators

z = (cid:18)z
y = (cid:18)y

again the monomial-divisor mirror map of [20] tells us that x is a k3 bration with a section
and that the section goes to innite size as y  0 and the k3 bre goes to innite size as
z  0. note that this hypergeometric system is remarkably similar to the elliptic bration
in the previous section (11).

we may nd the at coordinates as before, the exponentials of which we will call qz and

qy again. now when we put y = 0 one nds [23]

j(qz) =

1
z

.

(21)

that is, the moduli space of the k3 bre gives one cover of the j-line. the fact that the
j-line appears here can be argued directly as follows. with a suitable change of coordinates,
the constant k3 bre of (17) as y  0 may be written as

x2
0 + x6

2 + x6

(22)

{3,1,1,1} divided by z2  z6. this is manifestly a double cover of p2 branched over a
in p3
sextic curve. we may write p2 as a z2  z2-cover of p2 by mapping [y1, y2, y3]  [x2
2, x2
3].
this z2  z2 is a subgroup of the z2  z6 by which we are going to orbifold. that is, the
sextic curve is mapped to a cubic  i.e., an elliptic curve. thus the moduli space of the k3
surface can be mapped to the moduli space of an elliptic curve. a little work is involved in
showing that there is no level structure implicit on this elliptic curve and so one indeed gets
one copy of the j-line as desired.

1, x2

the heterotic interpretation of the at coordinates corresponding to qz and qy are the
single complex modulus of the torus and the dilaton-axion respectively [24].
indeed, the
appearance of the j-line above as y  0 shows that, in this limit we do indeed get the
correct moduli space for the torus  h/ sl(2, z). in this way we see that the t-duality of
the heterotic string on a torus at zero coupling is reproduced in the type-iia dual.

now what happens when we allow y to be nonzero? although the hypergeometric system
(20) is similar at rst sight to that of the previous section (11), there is a drastic dierence.
let us consider the behaviour of the discriminant locus in a constant y slice as y is near zero.
as discussed above, a component near z = 1/432 gave us two points (before identications
are made) close to where a cusp of the fundamental region was in the y = 0 limit. this cusp
corresponded to j = .

10

in this case in question here, the corresponding component of the discriminant locus is

given by

(1  1728 z)2  34562 z2y = 0.

(23)

at y = 0, the point z = 1/1728 is not a cusp on the j-line but rather the z2-orbifold point
at j = 1728. in the language of the k3 bre of x, the k3 surface acquires a z2-orbifold
point here (along with b = 0) to give an enhanced su(2) gauge symmetry.

now as we turn on y we have two solutions for z. this is exactly the situation that was
analyzed thoroughly by kachru et al [24, 25] where it was shown that the region of moduli
space near z = 1/1728 and y = 0 maps to seiberg-witten theory for an su(2) theory [27].
the single point y = 0, z = 1/1728 is the classical limit corresponding to an su(2) enhanced
gauge symmetry and the two points for constant y > 0 are the points giving the massless
solitons. the important result we wish to borrow from seiberg-witten theory is that in
at coordinates the monodromy around either of these two points alone is innite. the
monodromy within the curve y = 0 around both points together is z2  as we see from the
y = 0 limit.4

the situation here contrasted with that of the previous section can be summed up as

follows

 for the moduli space of s we have a point at y = 0 around which the monodromy is
innite. as y is switched on this splits into two points around which the monodromy
is z2.

 for the moduli space of x we have a point at y = 0 around which the monodromy
is z2. as y is switched on this splits into two points around which the monodromy is
innite.

this can all be traced back to the fact that for s, y = 0 gave a double cover of the j-line
while for x it gives a single cover.

we now wish to claim that this behaviour for x makes it completely impossible to
maintain any notion of t-duality when y is switched on. that is t-duality for the heterotic
string is broken as soon as the dilaton is switched on.

suppose we let y be small but nonzero. this should correspond to the weakly-coupled
heterotic string. the moduli space for the t 2 part must look almost like the classical
fundamental region for h/ sl(2, z). by almost we mean that no points in the moduli
space for t 2 can have moved a large distance with respect to the special kahler metric
relative to the y = 0 slice. we should now ask whether we can apply sl(2, z) to this new
moduli space to form a nice tessellated cover of the upper half plane just as we could for
y = 0. note in particular the the angle of any corner of the moduli space must correspond
to the monodromy in the levi-civita connection of the special kahler metric around that
point in order that such a tessellation works.

4this is not to say that the monodromy around the two points in the seibergwitten plane is z2. see [25].

figure 3: the moduli space for constant y for x.

in the case of x this correspondence fails. we show schematically5 what happens as
y is switched on in gure 3. near the edge of the moduli space labelled by l we need to
continue into a new fundamental region. this region must be distinct from that obtained
by    + 1 (otherwise there would be no monodromy around the dots labelling the
discriminant). clearly this is impossible without moving o onto a innitely-sheeted cover
of the upper-half plane.

note that one might want to extend the idea of duality by following the route of building
an innite-sheet covering.
indeed this was the idea behind such duality groups as those
proposed in [2] for example. one is certainly free do this mathematically and such a model
might have many uses. what is unclear however is the physical signicance of the huge
teichmuller space one builds by this process. it is certainly a considerable departure for the
usual meaning of t-duality or u-duality. if we want to have a meaningful teichmuller space
then we should insist that we have a unique idea of an object at large radius and weak string
coupling. this forces us to cover our moduli space with only one copy of a plane. we will
demand this for our notion of duality.

the essential dierence between this section where t-duality is broken and the previous
section where t-duality was exact is as follows. in the unbroken case we introduced new
copies of the fundamental region close to the horizontal axis im( ) = 0 when we switched
on the coupling in gure 2. in this section we had to attempt to add new regions near the
point  = i. the metric diverges near im( ) = 0 allowing room for new regions. new regions
cannot be tted in near  = i where the metric is nite.

we have also seen explicitly how the argument for t-duality using the enhanced gauge

5we do not claim that this picture represents the geometry very accurately. the only fact we really need

is that there is innite monodromy at a point in the moduli space which is at nite distance.

symmetry fails in this case. the weyl symmetry of su(2) was used to relate the deformations
increasing and decreasing r from its value at the point of enhanced symmetry. in fact, the
symmetry is never restored, and near the origin the monodromies about the two singularities
that do appear render any attempt to consistently dene the weyl-noninvariant coordinate
(a in [27]) futile.

4 discussion

4.1 holonomy arguments

one my try to forge a general setting for t-duality (and s-duality and u-duality) as follows.
one wants to begin with a general smooth teichmuller space, t , which parameterizes
familiar concepts such as length, coupling constants, etc. one then wants the moduli space
to look like m = t /g for some discrete duality group g. in particular this means that any
orbifold point in m is a global orbifold point. that is, there is a global cover which removes
this singularity.

orbifold points in a moduli space need not be global. we would like to consider the
appearance of local orbifold points as an obstruction to duality groups. of course one may
want to declare in such a case that the covering t itself has the orbifold point. one is
free to do this and one ends up with a weaker notion of duality groups. in a typical case
however this weak duality group will probably be trivial and so this is not a particularly
useful notion. for duality we will insist that all orbifold points are global and t is smooth.
thanks to the berger-simons theorem (see for example chapter 10 of [28]) knowing the
holonomy of a manifold can lead a considerable knowledge of its structure. if the holonomy
(on the levi-civita connection) and its representation on the tangent bundle is of a certain
type then the manifold must be a symmetric space. we will call such a holonomy rigid.
if the holonomy is non-rigid then the manifold is of type general riemannian, complex
kahler, hyperkahler, etc. by using the homogeneous structure of the symmetric spaces one
may argue the following by tracing geodesics.6

proposition 1 if a geodesically complete orbifold has a rigid holonomy then it is globally a
quotient of a symmetric space.

note that in lower dimensions, a suciently extended supersymmetry forces a rigid holon-
omy group. the proposition tells us immediately that we should expect duality groups to
appear for a large number of supersymmetries. for example for a type iia string on a
k3 surface we have n = 2 supersymmetry in six dimensions giving an r symmetry of
sp(1)  sp(1) = so(4) (up to discrete groups). given the dimension of the moduli space
this has rigid holonomy [29] and so we see a teichmuller space in the form of a symmetric

space and a t-duality group (or more generally a u-duality group). the same is not true for
an n = 2 theory in four dimensions however. here the holonomy of the moduli space only
dictates that it be the product of a kahler manifold and a quaternionic kahler manifold.
this non-rigid case should not be expected to have a duality group. this is the case of a
heterotic string on k3t 2.

this classication breaks down a little in higher dimensions. this happens because
symmetric spaces can sometimes have a holonomy (and representation) which appears to
be non-rigid. for example, the heterotic string on a 2-torus alone is an n = 1 theory in
eight dimensions which has an r symmetry u(1). this tells us only that the moduli space is
kahler and so would not in itself predict a t-duality group. nevertheless the moduli space
here is a quotient of a symmetric space. this shows that the holonomy can only tell us when
we must have a duality group rather than when we cannot. it seems reasonable however in
lower dimensions where this ambiguity does not exist that a generic compactication leading
to non-rigid holonomy will have no t-duality. the computation of section 3 shows this is
the case at least for one example.

4.2 consequences

we have shown that when one considers a heterotic string compactied on k3t 2 in a
particular way then the factor of the moduli space relevant to the torus is not a quotient of a
physically meaningful smooth space of parameters by some t-duality group. in particular it
is a completely meaningless statement to say that there is some kind of r  1/r symmetry
on the circles within this torus. for a nonzero value of the string coupling constant the torus
(and therefore circle) obeys a t-duality relationship no more than a generic calabiyau
threefold. the meaninglessness of t-duality for calabiyaus was discussed in [57].

the question that immediately raises itself is the following.

all one may do is to begin labelling points in the moduli space with size values near
the large radius limit and then extend this process over the entire moduli space. this will
usually lead to a minimum size. no real meaning can be attached to sizes below this value.
if t-duality fails for the
heterotic string on k3t 2 then does it also fail for a circle itself ? one might argue that if
the string on a circle of radius r is exactly the same thing as a string on a circle of radius
1/r then further compactication on k3s1 should also yield identical physics. this leads
to three possibilities:

1. t-duality fails for the string on a circle. that is, r  1/r symmetry is totally wrong
when all nonperturbative corrections are taken into account. this would seem to be
unlikely. for a string on a single circle at its self-dual radius we really see an unbroken
su(2) gauge symmetry signaling an identication in the moduli space. this su(2) is
broken by quantum eects when we consider k3t 2. the holonomy arguments above
also show that a lot of supersymmetry implies t-duality. we suggest therefore that
t-duality is a symmetry for a string on a circle by itself.

14

2. heterotic/type ii duality is wrong. if we really want t-duality to be respected exactly
by all strings then we need to sacrice the duality we used in this paper. one is free
to do this. we do not know enough about string theory to prove heterotic/type ii
duality. if one really is wedded to the idea of t-duality then this is a sacrice one
might be willing to make.

3. a string doesnt know about its compactications. when one says that one understands
some string theory compactied on some space, does this understanding ever include
further compactication? such a further compactication includes putting dierent
boundary conditions on elds which had lived in at space.
in particular one may
break supersymmetry. the above reasoning that r  1/r symmetry on a circle
implies t-duality for further compactication is wrong.

the last possibility would appear to be the most reasonable. it implies that r  1/r
symmetry of a circle depends on the context of the circle. any argument which uses t-duality
for a circle or torus embedded in some more complicated situation cannot necessarily be
considered rigorous.

in this paper we have considered the kachruvafa example of the heterotic string com-
pactied on a torus stuck at  =  . this allowed us to consider just a two-parameter
family of calabiyau threefolds  one remaining parameter for the torus and the string
coupling. our failure to see an sl(2, z) modular group can therefore be viewed just as much
as failure of the classical sl(2, z) modular group as of t-duality. what one should do is to
go to the three parameter example of [24] so that we may disentangle the  and  parameters
of the 2-torus. the essential computation was again done in [25]. the coarse result of this
is that the moduli space does not respect any sl(2, z) symmetry generically.

this is perhaps a good deal more shocking at rst sight than breaking t-duality. are we
really saying that string theory breaks the classical modular invariance of a torus? in other
words string theory does not respect dieomorphism invariance of the target space!

this is unavoidable if one wants to maintain heterotic/type ii duality. actually this

possibility is not as bad as it might rst appear upon reection.

one is used to the idea from conformal eld theory at weak string coupling that quantum
geometry may eect the structure of the moduli space of complexied kahler form but that
the complex structure moduli space is unchanged. now we claim that string coupling eects
may also lead to quantum corrections to the moduli space of complex structures. this
is quite reasonable in the current context as once string corrections have been taken into
account the moduli space of the 2-torus does not even factorize exactly into kahler form and
complex structure parts. note also that the parts of the moduli space whose shape is most
eected by the corrections are those close to where the enhanced gauge symmetry appeared
in the weak coupling limit. these must involve circles in the torus approaching the string
scale. thus it is still distances at the string scale in some sense which are most aected by
quantum eects.

15

again we should emphasize is that we are not really saying that a string on a certain
torus is dierent to a string on the torus having undergone a modular transform. rather
we are saying that once the string coupling is not zero, the moduli space of is no longer of
the form h/ sl(2, z). the meaning of what is it to go outside the fundamental region then
becomes unclear.

finally we note that all of the results in this paper have tied to dualities of the heterotic
string. one might wish the type ii string to escape such eects. this appears to be unlikely.
our holonomy argument of section 4.1 would seem to imply that a generic compactication
with little supersymmetry should not obey any t-duality or u-duality laws. what is true
however is that the type iia string has more supersymmetry to begin with. thus we know
that t-duality for the type iia string k3t 2 is exact (see, for example, [30] for a discussion
of this). what one might question however is whether the same is true for the type ii string
on z  s1 where z is a generic calabiyau threefold.
