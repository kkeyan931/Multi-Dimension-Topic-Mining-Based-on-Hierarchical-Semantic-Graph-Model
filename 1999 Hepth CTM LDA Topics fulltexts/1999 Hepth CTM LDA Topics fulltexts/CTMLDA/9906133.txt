(of course, precise time interval start reaction massenergy conversion depends particular characteristics process involved ; example, positron-electron annihilation take place either instantaneously positronium formation, depending collision geometry.) see therefore times arrow, obtained result reactions massenergy conversion takes place, least one reactant/product particles must travelling time direction opposite others. recall reactions must involve particles antiparticles, known properties antiparticles, conclude antiparticle obtained combined operation charge conjugation c, parity p time reversal (in order) particle ; similarly, cpt operating antiparticle gives us particle. since total number particles antiparticles process involving particles antiparticles always even, matrix element process remains invariant cpt operation. (this invariance quite self-evident, remember cpt theorem supposed valid local eld theories ; work seems broadened scope.) c shown , however, pay price ; correlation past understood epr-like sense lorentz invariant sense, maintain energy conservation. (this serves remind us quantum mechanics special relativity always strange bedfellows.) is, course, convention language visualise particles, i.e. constituents universe moving forward time, thus establishing causal link past future. 3 conclude, found physical basis feynmans idea antiparticles considered particles moving backward time, also found scope cpt theorem extended cover non-local gauge elds. thank dr j chakravarti, department theoretical physics interest ongoing work. 4
