functorial qft, gauge anomalies and the dirac

determinant bundle

jouko mickelsson and simon scott

abstract. using properties of the determinant line bundle for a family of elliptic

boundary value problems, we explain how the fock space functor denes an axiomatic

quantum eld theory which formally models the fermionic path integral. the sewing

axiom of the theory arises as an algebraic pasting law for the determinant of the

dirac operator. we show how representations of the boundary gauge group t into

this description and that this leads to a fock functor description of certain gauge

anomalies.

1. introduction

advances in the construction of topological invariants for low-dimensional manifolds

using methods from gauge theory have led to a great deal of interest in the construction

of quantum eld theories as modied cohomology theories [1, 22, 23, 25, 26]; that is, as

generalized functors from manifolds to vector spaces. the purpose of this paper is to ex-

plain a construction of a functorial quantum eld theory (fqft) using the fock functor,

generalizing a construction suggested by segal [22] in (1+1)-dimensions. this may be of

particular interest in view of recent developments in the theory of branes in superstring

theory. in doing so, we realize the higher-dimensional gauge group representations of

[14] in terms of a d+1-dimensional fqft, while the gluing law of the fqft arises as an

algebraic pasting law for the determinant of a dirac operator with respect to a partition

of the underlying manifold.

the aim of fqft is to abstract the algebraic structure that the path integral would

create if it existed as a rigorous mathematical object. with respect to a partition of

the underlying manifold the functoriality formally encodes intriguing formal gluing laws

for spectral or topological invariants realized as expectation values. the prototypical

situation we consider is for a family of chiral dirac operators over an even-dimensional

manifold with closed odd-dimensional boundary. the parameter space a in this case is

an ane space of gauge potentials cross riemannian metrics, acting on which one has a

group g of gauge transformations. to a spin manifold x with boundary y endowed with
an admissible decomposition hy = w  w  of the space of boundary spinor elds, the
fock functor associates a fock space fw of holomorphic sections of a relative determinant
line bundle over the restricted grassmannian dened by the polarization w . globally

the functor associates a bundle f of fock spaces to the parameter space a and the

sewing properties of the determinant line bundle for a family of elliptic boundary value

problems explained in [20] translate into the required functorial properties of the fqft.

the constructions of [14] arise in this situation in terms of two orthogonal g-anomalies.

first, there is the bulk even-dimensional chiral anomaly measuring the obstruction to

a g-equivariant determinant regularization. second, associated to the gauge group on

the boundary one has the odd-dimensional mickelsson-faddeev commutator anomaly.

in the fqft context the g-action is lifted from a to a projective bundle map on the

fock bundle, rather than an automorphism of the whole (xed) space of sections of the

determinant line bundle [14]. fqft formally encodes the relation between the path

integral and hamiltonian approaches to second quantization, the fock functor fqft

we consider provides a coherent framework in which to describe simultaneously the path

integral (determinant line) description of gauge anomalies and their hamiltonian (fock

space) realization. we hope this may serve to clarify some of the underlying mathematical

structures of the qft.

in the remainder of the introduction we recall from [1, 23, 26] the axiomatic char-

acterization of a qft and the heuristic path integral formulae this aims to encode. in

section 2 we explain some facts about determinant bundles and fock spaces associated

to families of elliptic boundary value problems. in section 3 we dene the fock space

functor in general and outline its fundamental properties. in section 4 we apply this

to the interactive yang-mills gauge theory associated to a and discuss the boundary

gauge group action and the chiral anomaly and commutator anomalies. in section 5 we

outline the path integral formulae for an elliptic boundary value problem which the fock

functor aims to model, and present a concrete 0 + 1-dimensional example which relates

our constructions to the nite-dimensional fermionic (berezin) integral.

1.1. axiomatic qft. a (d+1)-dimensional fqft means a functor from the category

cd of d-dimensional closed manifolds and cobordisms to the category of vector spaces and
linear maps, which satises certain natural axioms suggested by path integral formulae. a

morphism in cd between d-dimensional manifolds y0, y1 is a (d+1)-dimensional manifold
x with boundary x = y0  y1. the orientation on the incoming boundary y0 is
assumed to be induced by the orientation of x and the inward directed normal vector

eld on the boundary, whereas for the outgoing boundary y1 the orientation is xed by
the outward directed normal vector eld. let cvect denote the category whose objects
are topological vector spaces and whose morphisms are homomorphisms.

a d + 1-dimensional fqft means a functor z : cd  cvect assigning to each d-
dimensional manifold y a vector space z(y ) and to each cobordism x a vector zx 
z(x). by at z() = c, so that if x is closed then zx is a complex number. z is
required to satisfy the following axioms.

for (d + 1)-dimensional manifolds x, x0, x1 and d-dimensional manifolds y, y0, y1:

a1. multiplicativity: zx0x1 = zx0  zx1 , z(y0  y1) = z(y0)  z(y1).
a2. duality: if y denotes y with reversed orientation then z(y ) = z(y ).

determinant bundles and fqft

a3. associativity: if m = x0 y x1 with x0 = y0  y and x1 = y  y1, then

a4. hermitian: zx = zx.

zm = zx1  zx0.

the associativity property refers to the fact that axioms a1 and a2 mean that a cobor-
dism x  cd induces a linear transformation zx  cvect through the identications

zx  z(y0  y1) = z(y0)  z(y1) = z(y0)  z(y1) = hom(z(y0), z(y1)).

thus morphisms in cd are taken to morphisms in cvect. in particular, we have then a
canonical pairing z(y0)  z(y )  z(y )  z(y1)  z(y0)  z(y1). in the case when
y0 = y1 = , so m is a closed manifold , this becomes a pairing

(1)

( , ) : z(y )  z(y )  c,

and a3 implies the sewing property

(2)

zm = (zx0 , zx1 ).

this is perhaps the most striking feature of a fqft, it states that by partitioning the

manifold m into simpler codimension 0 submanifolds, the number zm can be computed
by evaluating over the submanifolds and then sewing together the results via the bilinear

pairing. the bilinear pairing further implies that if x = y  y and f : y  y is an

orientation reversing dieomorphism, then

(3)

tr (zx (f )) = zxf .

here xf is the closed manifold obtained by identifying the boundary components via f ,
and zx(f )  end(z(y )) is induced by functoriality (and in (3) is implicitly assumed to
be trace class).

the hermitian axiom a4 applies to the case of a unitary fqft. this means there is

a non-degenerate hermitian structure < , >: z(y )  z(y )  c, and hence a canonical
isomorphism z(y )  z(y ). a4 is the corresponding expected behaviour of zx .

these axioms are idealized, and in practice some modications are needed. this is

illustrated in the fqft we consider in section 3.

1.2. heuristic path integral formulae. the above framework aims to algebraicize

the relation between the feynman path integral formulation of qft and its hilbert space

formulation. the following heuristic interpretation is useful to bear in mind. if x has

connected boundary, the vector zx represents the partition function, which is given by
a formal path integral

(4)

zx : e(y )  c, zx (f ) =zef (x)

es()d,

where d is a formal measure. here s : ef (x)  c is an action functional on a space
of elds on x, which for deniteness we shall take to be the space of c0 functions on x,

4

jouko mickelsson and simon scott

with boundary value f  e(y ). the vector space z(y ) is a space of functions on e(y )

and forms the hilbert space of the theory, and zx is the vacuum state.

to a cobordism x  cd with x = y0  y0 one has f = (f0, f1), and then

zx(f0, f1) :ze(f0 ,f1 )(x)

es()d,

is the kernel of the linear operator zx  hom(z(y0), z(y1)) dened by

zx(0)(f1) =ze(y0)

zx (f0, f1)0(f0)df0.

if y0 = y1 = y we hence obtain the bilinear form on z(y )  z(y ) corresponding to

(1):

< 0, 1 >=ze(y )

1(f )zx (0)(f ) df.

in the case of a closed manifold m = x0 y x1 we can express the space of c0 functions
on m as a bre product e(m ) = e(x0) e(y ) e(x1) and so formally one expects an
equality

ze(m)

es()d = ze(y )
= ze(y )

(5)

dfzef (x0)

es(0)d0zef (x1)

es(1)d1

zx0 (f )zx1 (f )df.

which is the path integral version of the algebraic sewing formula (2). the hamiltonian
of the theory is dened by the euclidean time evolution operator eth = zy [0,t] 
end(z(y )), and to compute the trace one has the integral formulae

and corresponding to (4)

(6)

tr (eth ) =ze(y )

tr zx (f, f ) df,

tr (eth(f )) =ze(xf )

es() d.

the sewing formula (105) says that the partition function on m is the vacuum-vacuum

expectation value calculated from the partition functions on the two halves. equivalently:

the invariant zm is obtained from zx0(f ) and zx1 (f ) by integrating (averaging) away
the choice of boundary data f . in the case of determinants of dirac operators this formal-

ism provides some insightful to sewing formulae relative to a partition of the underlying

manifold (see section 5). first, we need to review some facts about determinant and

fock bundles for families of dirac operators.

determinant bundles and fqft

2. determinant line bundles and fock spaces

the determinant of a family of rst-order elliptic operators arises canonically not

as a function, but as a section of a complex line bundle called the determinant line

bundle. the anomalies we shall discuss may be realized as obstructions to constructing

appropriate trivializations of that bundle. equivalently, we can view the determinant

line of an operator as a ray in the associated fock space (via the plucker embedding),

and globally the determinant bundle as rank 1 subbundle of an innite-dimensional fock

bundle to which the gauge group lifts as a projective bundle map.

first, recall the construction of the determinant line bundle for a family of dirac-

type operators over a closed compact manifold m . such a family can be specied by

a smooth bration of manifolds  : m  b with bre dieomorphic to m , endowed

with a riemannian metric gm/b along the bres and a vertical bundle of cliord modules
s(m/b) which we may identify with the vertical spinor bundle tensored with an external

vertical gauge bundle . we assume that  is endowed with a hermitian structure with

compatible connection. the manifold b is not required to be compact. we refer to this

data as a geometric bration.

associated to a geometric bration one has a smooth elliptic family of dirac operators
d = {db : b  b} : h  h, where h = (s(m/b)) is the innite-dimensional
hermitian vector bundle on b whose bre at b is the frechet space of smooth sections
hb = c(mb, sb), where sb is the appropriate cliord bundle. if m is even-dimensional
there is a z2 bundle grading h = f +  f  into positive and negative chirality elds and
we then have a family of chiral dirac operators d : f +  f . the quillen determinant
line bundle det (d) is a complex line bundle over b with bre at b canonically isomorphic
to the complex line det (kerdb)  det coker(db) [5, 18], where for a nite-dimensional
vector space v , det v is the complex line maxv . the bundle structure is dened relative
to the covering of b by open subsets u, with   r+, parameterising those operators
db for which  is not in the spectrum of the laplacian d
b db. over each u are smooth
nite-rank vector bundles h +
b db (resp. of
dbd

 equal to the sum of eigenspaces of d

b ) for eigenvalues less than , and one denes

 , h 

(7)

det (d)|u = det (h +

 )  det h 
 .

the locally dened line bundles patch together over the overlaps u  u in a natural
way. this spectral construction of the determinant line bundle is designed to allow one
to dene the quillen -function metric and a compatible connection whose curvature r
is identied with the 2-form component of the bismut familys index density:

(8)

r = (2i)n/2"zm/b ba(m/b)ch()#2

,

where ba(m/b) is the vertical a-hat form and ch the chern character, see [18, 5, 4].

there is, however, a natural alternative construction of the determinant line bundle,

due to segal [24, 17], and applied to dirac families in [20], which allows us to consider

6

jouko mickelsson and simon scott

more general smooth families of fredholm operators, which need not be elliptic operators.
let  : h 0  h 1 be a fredholm operator of index zero. then a point of the complex
line over  is an equivalence class [a, ] of pairs (a, ), where the operator a : h 0  h 1
is such that a    end(h 0) is trace-class,   c, and the equivalence relation is
dened by (aq, )  (a, detf (q)) for q  end(h 0) an operator of the form identity
plus trace-class, and detf denotes the fredholm determinant.
if ind  = d we dene
det () := det (  0) with   0 acting h 0  h 1  cd if d > 0, or h 0  cd  h 1 if
d < 0. note that, by denition, a fredholm operator of index zero has an approximation

by an invertible operator a such that a has nite rank. we work with the larger ideal

of trace-class operators in order to be able to use the (complete) topology determined by

the trace norm.

the abstract determinant of  is dened to be the canonical element det  := [, 1] 
det (). for an admissible smooth family of fredholm operators a = {b : b  b} :
h0  h1 acting between (weak) vector bundles hi [20, 24], the union det (a) of the
determinant lines is naturally a complex line bundle. the bundle structure is dened rel-
ative to a denumerable open covering of open sets u , where  : h0  h1 is nite-rank
and u parameterizes those b for which b + b is invertible, via the local trivializa-
tion b 7 det(b + b) over u . on the intersection u 1  u 2 the transition function is
b  detf ((b +  1
b )). for a family of elliptic operators, such as d, there is
a canonical isomorphism between the two constructions of the determinant bundle de-
scribed above which preserves the determinant section b 7 det db, and we may therefore
use them interchangeably [20].

b )1(b +  2

this is important when we consider the determinant line bundle for a family of elliptic

boundary value problems (ebvps). to dene such a family we proceed initially as for the

case of a closed manifold with a geometric bration  : m  b of connected manifolds,

but with bre dieomorphic to a compact connected manifold x with boundary x = y .

note that the boundary manifolds m and x may possibly be disconnected. globally
we obtain as before a family of dirac operators d = {db : b  b} : h  h. we
assume that the geometry in a neighbourhood u  m  [0, 1] of the boundary is a pull-

back of the geometry induced on the boundary geometric bration of closed boundary

manifolds  : m  b. this means that all metrics and connections on t (m/b) and

s(m/b) restricted to u are geometric products composed of the trivial geometry in the

normal u-coordinate direction, and the boundary geometry in tangential directions, so
gm/b = du2 + gm/b and so forth. in ub := u  xb  [0, 1] the dirac operator db then
has the form

(9)

db|u = gb(cid:18) 

u

+ dy,b(cid:19) ,

where dy,b is a boundary dirac operator and gb is a unitary bundle automorphism,
the cliord multiplication related to the outward directed vector eld 
u . the family
of boundary dirac operators dy = {dy,b : b  b} : hy  hy , where hy is the

determinant bundles and fqft

7

bundle with bre c(yb, syb) at b  b, is identied with family dened by the bration
 : m  b.

in contrast to the closed manifold case, the operators db are not fredholm. the crucial
analytical property underlying the following determinant line and fock bundle identica-

tions is the existence of a canonical identication between the innite-dimensional space

ker(db) of solutions to the dirac operator and the boundary traces k(db) = ker(db),
where  : c(xb, sb)  c(yb, syb ) is the operator restricting sections to the boundary.
more precisely, the poisson operator kb : c(yb, syb )  c(xb, sb) restricts to dene
the above isomorphism. it extends to a continuous operator kb : h s1/2(yb; s|yb) 
h s(xb; s) on the sobolev completions with range

ker(db, s) = {f  h s(xb; s) : dbf = 0 in xb \ yb} ,

b : k(db, s))  ker(db, s) is an isomorphism (see [6, 11]). the poisson operator

and ks
of db denes the calderon projection:

(10)

p (db) = k1
b .

p (db) is a pseudodierential projection on l2(yb, syb) which we can take to be orthogo-
nal with range equal to ker(d, s). the construction depends smoothly on the parameter
b  b and so globally we obtain a smooth map p (d) : b  end(hy ) dening, equiv-
alently, a smooth frechet subbundle k(d) of hy with bre k(db) = range(p (db)).
because of the tubular boundary geometry, p (db) in fact diers from the aps spectral
projection b by only a smoothing operator, see [19, 11]. recall that there is a polar-
ization hyb = h +
into the non-negative and negative energy modes of the elliptic
self-adjoint boundary dirac operator dy,b and b is dened to be the orthogonal projec-
tion onto h +
b . hence p (db) is certainly an element of the hilbert-schmidt grassmannian
grb parameterizing projections on hy,b which dier from b by a hilbert-schmidt oper-
ator, where by projection we mean self-adjoint indempotent. associated to p  grb we
have the elliptic boundary value problem (ebvp) for db

b  h +

b

(11)

dp,b = db : dom(dp,b)  l2(xb; s1)

with domain dom dp,b = {s  h 1(xb; s0
: p (s|yb) = 0}. the operator dp,b is
b )
fredholm with kernel and cokernel consisting of smooth sections, see [6] for a general
account of ebvps in index theory. the smooth family of ebvps dgrb := {dp,b :
p  grb} denes an admissible family of fredholm operators and hence an associated
determinant line bundle det (dgrb )  grb. on the other hand, for each choice of a
basepoint p0  grb we have the smooth family of fredholm operators

{pw0,w := p  p0 : w0  w : p  grb},

where ran(p0) = w0, ran(p ) = w ,and hence a relative (segal) determinant line bundle
det w0  grb based at w0. the bundles so dened for dierent choices of basepoint are
all isomorphic, but not quite canonically. more precisely, from [22, 20], given p0, p1  grb

8

jouko mickelsson and simon scott

there is a canonical line bundle isomorphism

(12)

det w0

= det w1  det (w0, w1),

where det (w0, w1) means the trivial line bundle with bre the relative determinant
line det (w0, w1) := det (pw0,w1 ). in view of the identication dened by the poisson
operator it is perhaps not surprising that the determinant line bundle det (dgrb) is
classied by the basepoint kb: there is a canonical line bundle isomorphism

(13)

det (dgrb) = det kb,

preserving the determinant sections

det(dgrb )  det(sb(p )),

where sb(p ) := p p (db) : k(db)  ran(p ). (see [20]). to translate these facts into
global statements for operators parameterized by b we require the notion of a spectral

section, or grassmann section [20] (we may use both names, the latter is sometimes more

appropriate in more general situations). for each b  b we have the restricted grassman-
nian grb and globally these hilbert manifolds t together to dene a bration gry  b.
a spectral section p = {pb : b  b} for the family d is dened to be a smooth section
of that bration, and we denote the space of sections by gr(m/b). by cobordism, such

sections always exist. in particular, the family of dirac operators d denes canonically

the calderon section p (d)  gr(m/b). in this sense one may think of the parameter

space b as a generalized grassmannian (i.e. parameterizing the subspaces k(db)), and
the usual grassmannian as a universal moduli space. notice, however, that the map
b  b is generically not a smooth spectral section because of the ow of eigenvalues
of the boundary family. indeed, it is this elementary fact that is the source of gauge

anomalies, see [15] and section 4. a spectral section has a number of consequences for

determinants:

first: we obtain a smooth family of ebvps (d, p) = {dp,b := (db)pb : b  b} which
has an associated determinant line bundle det (d, p)  b with determinant section
b 7 dp,b.

second: a spectral section p denes a smooth innite-dimensional vector bundle w

with bre wb = range(pb), and associated to p we have the smooth family of fred-
holm operators d(p) : k(d)  w, parameterizing the operators s(pb) := pk(db),wb :
k(db)  wb. this also has a determinant line bundle det (d(p)), and corresponding
to (13), there is a canonical line bundle isomorphism

(14)

det (d, p) = det (d(p)),

det(dp,b)  det(s(pb)),

preserving the determinant sections. given a pair of sections p1, p2  gr(m/b) there
is the smooth family of admissible fredholm operators (p1, p2) : w 1  w 2, and corre-
sponding to (12) and (14) one nds a canonical isomorphism

(15)

det (d, p1) = det (d, p2)  det (p1, p2),

determinant bundles and fqft

(which does not preserve the determinant sections). we refer to [20] for details.

third: we obtain a bundle of fock spaces fp over b. to see this, return for a moment

to the case of a single operator and its grassmannian grb. by choosing a basepoint
p0  grb, we obtain the determinant line bundle det w0  grb. this is a holomorphic
line bundle, but has no global holomorphic sections. the dual bundle det 
w0 , on
the other hand, has an innite-dimensional space of holomorphic sections, and this,

by denition, is the fock space based at w0:

(16)

fw0,b := hol(grb; det 

w0 ).

actually, a fock space comes together with a vacuum vector and a representation of the

canonical anticommutation relations; we shall return to this at the end of the section.
taking the union fb := w grbfw,b we obtain the fock bundle over grb. this bundle
is topologically completely determined by the determinant bundle det w0 , in fact this
is the most direct way to dene the bundle structure on fb. to be precise, if we change
the basepoint we nd, dropping the b subscript, a canonical isomorphism

fw1 = hol(gr; det 
= hol(grb; det 
= hol(grb; det 
= fw0  det (w0, w1),

w1 )
w0  det (w1, w0))
w0 )  det (w1, w0)

where we use (12). hence relative to a basepoint w0  grb we have a canonical isomor-
phism

(17)

fb = fw0  det w0 ,

where the rst factor on the right-side is the trivial bundle with bre fw0 . hence
the topological type of the fock bundle fb is determined by that of the determinant line
bundle det w0 for any basepoint w0. one moves between the isomorphisms for dierent
basepoints via (12).

as an abstract vector bundle, a fock bundle is always trivial (but not necessarily

canonically); this is because of the fact that (according to kuipers theorem) the uni-

tary group in an innite-dimensional hilbert space is contractible. however, as already

mentioned, the fock spaces are equipped with additional structure, the vacuum vectors

related to a choice of a family of (dirac) hamiltonians, which will modify this statement.

in the case of (17) we have a preferred line bundle (the vacuum bundle) inside of the

hilbert bundle and the structure group is reduced giving a nontrivial fock bundle; this

will be discussed in more detail in section 4.

now as we let b vary we obtain a vertical fock bundle f (m/b) over the total space
gry of the grassmann bration, which restricted to the bre grb of gry coincides with
fb. the bundle structure is a obvious from the local triviality of the bration gry  b.
a spectral section p is a smooth cross section of that bration, and hence by pull-back

10

jouko mickelsson and simon scott

we get a fock bundle over b associated to p:

(18)

fp := p(f (m/b))  b,

with bre fpb = hol(grb; det 
wb ), wb = ran(pb) at b  b. in the following we may
at times also write fp = fw, where w  b is the bundle associated to p. moreover,
from the equivalences above we get that the various fock bundles are related in the

following way.

proposition 2.1. for spectral sections p1, p2  gr(m/b), there is a canonical isomor-
phism of fock bundles

(19)

fp1 = fp2  det (p1, p2).

notice, in a similar way to fp, we can also identify the determinant line bundle
det (p1, p2) as a pull-back bundle. for associated to the section p1 we have a vertical
determinant line bundle det p1  gry , which restricts to det w 1
over grb, where
b ). then det (p1, p2) = (p2)(det p1). in particular, associated to the
w 1
family d of dirac operators parameterized by b, we have the canonical spectral section
p (d), and by (14) we have a canonical isomorphism det (d, p) = p(det p (d)). at
the fock space level we have a fock bundle fd canonically associated to the family

b = ran(p 1

b

d, independently of an extrinsic choice of spectral section, whose bre at b  b is
fdb := hol(grb; det (dgrb)). from (13) and (19) we obtain the fock space version
of (14) and (15):

proposition 2.2. there is a canonical isomorphism of fock bundles

(20)

for p  gr(m/b):

(21)

fd = fp (d).

fd = fp  det (d, p).

thus the topology of fock bundle and the determinant line bundle are intimately related.

this is the topological reason relating the schwinger terms in the hamiltonian anomaly

to the index density.

the fock space fw0 based at w0  grb can be thought of more concretely in terms
of equivariant functions on the stiefel frame bundle over grb. to describe this we x

similarly, for w  grb we have det w = stw gl1 c, where stw is the corresponding

specied by an invertible operator a : w0  w1 such that p1p0  a is trace-class, from
which we once again have the identication (12).

is the vacuum vector. equivalently, an element of fwb is a holomorphic function f :
det wb  c which is linear on each bre, and from this view point the vacuum vector
is the function

(24)

wb ([, ]) = detf (pwb ),

for any representative (, ) of the equivalence class [, ]  det (wb, w ).

a generalization of this leads to the plucker embedding. first, for w  grb, x an
orthonormal basis {ei}iz of hb such that ei  w  for i  0 and ei  w for i > 0;. let
s be the set of all increasing sequences of integers s = (i1, i2, . . . ) with s  n and n  s
nite. for each sequence s we have an admissible basis (s) = {ei1, ei2 , . . . }  stw ,
and the fredholm index of the operator pspw : w  hs, where hs is the closed
subspace spanned by (s) and ps the corresponding orthogonal projection, denes a
bijection 0(grb)  z. the plucker coordinates of the basis   stw are the collection
of complex numbers s() = detf (ps) = detf (s), where s is the matrix formed

from the rows of  =  +

 ! labeled by s. in particular n() is the coordinate dened

by the vacuum vector. if  is a basis for w

 grb, then the plucker coordinates of a
second admissible basis 1 dier from those of  by the fredholm determinant of the
matrix relating the two bases. the plucker coordinates therefore dene a projective
embedding grb  fw . this is prescribed equivalently by the map



(25)

 : stwb  stwb  c,

(, ) = detf ( ) = detf ( 

++ +  

),

with respect to which the plucker coordinates are s() = ((s), ).  is the same
thing as the map on the determinant bundle

(26)

g : det wb  det wb  c,

g([, ], [, ]) = detf (pw ),

where  : wb  w , (resp.  : wb  w
antilinear (resp.

linear) in the rst (resp. second) variable. we then have the plucker

which maps [, ] 7 (, . ), or, using the segal denition of the determinant line

by

(29)

notice that

(30)

[,]() = detf (  ) = detf (  pw  ).

det(idwb ) 7 wb ,

where idwb := pwb,wb . the map (27) thus denes a projective embedding grb  fw

the map (26) restricted to a linear map det wb  det wb  c, denes a canonical
metric on det wb by k[, ]k2 = ||2detf (), and globally, via (14), we get the
canonical metric of [20] on det (d, p)

(31)

kdet dpbk2 := g(s(pb), s(pb)) = detf (s(pb)s(pb)).

on the other hand, we can use the map  (or g) to put a unitary structure on fw
with respect to which (27) is an isometry. to do that we use the fact that any section in
fw can be written as a linear combination of the [,], and set

(32)

< [,], [,] >w = g([, ], [, ]).

in particular, the nite linear combinations of the sections s, s  s are dense in fw
with respect to the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets, and one has

< s, s >= ((s), (s



)) = ss .

notice further the identities

(33)

< w , w >w = 1

and

< [,], [,] >w = k[, ]k2,

the latter being the statement that (27) is an isometry. for further details see [17] and

[14].

there is a dierent way of thinking about fock spaces which is perhaps more familiar

to physicists, as an innite-dimensional exterior algebra (fermionic fock space). recall

[14] that a polarization w of the hilbert space hb xes a representation of the canon-
ical anticommutation relations (car) in a fock space f (hb, w ), whose only non-zero
anticommutators are

(34)

a(v)a(u) + a(u)a(v) =< u, v > .

the dening property of this irreducible representation is that there is a vacuum vector

|w > with the property

(35)

a(u)|w >= 0 = a(v)|w > for all u  w, v  w .

determinant bundles and fqft

13

one has

(36)

f (hb, w ) = (w )  ((w )) = xd=qpz

p(w )  q((w )).

the vacuum |w > is represented as the unit element in the exterior algebra. for u  w,
a(u) corresponds to interior multiplication by u, the creation operator a(u) is given by
exterior multiplication. for u  w  the operator a(u) (resp., a(u)) is given by exterior
(resp., interior) multiplication by ju; here j : h  h  is the canonical antilinear
isomorphism from a complex hilbert space to its dual. the vacuum |w > has then the
characteristic property a(u)|w >= 0, u  w, and a(v)|w >= 0, v  w ..

if we choose a dierent w   grb then there is a complex vacuum line in f (hb, w )
corresponding to the new polarization w . the dierent vacuum lines parameterized by
the planes w  form another realization for the determinant bundle det w over grb as a
subbundle of the trivial fock bundle with bre fw . the plucker embedding det w 

f (hb, w ) is dened by mapping (, )  stw  c to pss dets s, where s is as

before. a hermitian metric on f (hb, w ) is again dened by < s, s >= ss . on
the other hand, the nite-dimensional matrix identity for  : cm  cn,  : cn  cm
with n  m:

(37)

det() =x(i)

det((i))det((i)),

the sum being over all sequences (i) = {1  i1 < i2 . . . in  m}, with (i) (resp. (i))
the matrix obtained from a (resp. b) by selecting the columns of a (resp. rows of b)

labeled by s, implies the pairing of fock space vectors

(38)

< [,], [,] >=xss

,((s))[,]((s)).

the metrics so dened on the car construction f (hb, w ) and the geometric construc-
tion fw of the fock space, then correspond under the algebraic isomorphism dened by
associating to each section s  fw the vector

a(ei1 ) . . . a(eip)a(ej1 ) . . . a(ejq )|w > f(hb, w ),

where i1 < i2 < . . . ip  0 is the set of negative indices in the sequence s and 0 < j1 <
j2 < . . . jq is the set of missing positive indices, giving a dense inclusion f (hb, w ) 
fw .

returning to the case of a family d of dirac-type operators parameterized by a man-

ifold b, if we are given a spectral section p  gr(m/b) then we have the global version
of the above properties. associated to p we have a fock bundle fw  b and this is
endowed with a unitary structure < , >p, given on the bre fwb by (32). the bundle
fw has a distinguished section, the vacuum section p = w , assigning to b  b the vac-
uum vector wb , with unit norm in the bres. associated to the canonical calderon

14

jouko mickelsson and simon scott

section p (d) dening the fock bundle fk we then have a determinant line bundle
det (d, p) = det (d(p)) and a generalized plucker embedding

(39)

det (d, p) = det (d(p))  fk,

corresponding to the view point on the parameter space b as a generalized grassmannian.

more generally, for any pair of spectral sections p1, p2, there is a generalized plucker
embedding

(40)

det (p1, p2)  fp1,

dened brewise by the embeddings det (w1,b, w2,b)  det w1,b  fw1,b , which ac-
cording to (27) is the map [, ] 7 [,]  fp1. so, a section of the determinant bundle
det (p1, p2) denes a section of the fock bundle fp1. in particular, the vacuum section
is the image of the determinant section in the trivial case

(41)

det (p1, p1)  fp1,

associated to the family of dirac operators d, we have a canonical vacuum section
k  fk with < kb, kb >kb= 1, and if we choose an external spectral section p, then
via (39) we have a canonical section k,p of fk corresponding to the determinant section
b 7 det(dpb )  det(s(pb)) of det (d, p), with

(42)

< k,p, k,p >kb= kdet(s(pb))k2
c.

that is, the generalized plucker embedding (39) is an isometry with respect to the

canonical metric on det (d, p). this follows by construction from (33).

as we already mentioned, as an abstract vector bundle the fock bundle is trivial. how-

ever, the non-triviality of the construction lies in the (locally dened) physical vacuum

subbundle dened by the family of hamiltonians. as an example, assume that we have

a family of dirac hamiltonians parameterized by the set a of smooth vector potentials.

given a real number  we can dene w0(a) as the subspace of the boundary hilbert
space corresponding to the spectral restriction dy,a >  for the boundary hamiltonian;
a 7 w0(a) is a smooth grassmann section over the set u  a of hamiltonians with
 / spec(dy,a). let a 7 w1(a) be a globally dened grassmann section. for each
a  u we have a well-dened vacuum line |a > fw1(a). this line is just the image of
the determinant line det (w1(a), w0(a)) with respect to the map (29). if dim y = 1
the grassmannian gra does not depend on the parameter a and we may take w1(a) as
a constant section. anyway, the bundle of vacua over u can be identied as the relative
determinant bundle det (w1, w0) and the twisting of this bundle depends solely on the
twisting of the local section a 7 w0(a).

3. construction of the fqft

in this section we utilize the facts presented in the previous section to piece together a

fqft, generalized from the two dimensional case proposed by segal [22]. as in section

1.1, the constructions are mathematical and do not refer to any particular physical sys-

tem. in the next section we explain how the chiral anomaly and commutator anomaly

arise in this context.

3.1. strategy. we dene a projective functor from a subcategory cd of the category of
spin manifolds to the category cvect of z-graded vector spaces and linear maps, which
factors through the category cgr of linear relations:

cd  cgr

 

cvect

the combination of these functors is the fock functor dening the fqft.

3.2. projective representations of categories. by a category c we mean a set ob(c)
of elements called the objects of c, and for any two elements a, b  ob(c) a set morc(a, b)
of morphisms a 7 b, such that for a, b, c  ob(c) there is a multiplication dened

morc(a, b)  morc(b, c)  morc(a, c),

(fa,b, fb,c) 7 fb,c  fa,b.

the product is required to be associative, so that if fc,d  morc(c, d), then fc,d(fb,cfa,b) =
(fc,dfb,c)fa,b. one usually also asserts the existence of an identity morphism idb 
morc(b, b) which satises idb  fa,b = fa,b and fb,c  idb = fb,c.



a (covariant) functor  from a category c to a category c

means a map  : ob(c) 
) and for each pair a, b  ob(c) a map a,b : morc(a, b)  morc ((a), (b)) such



ob(c

that

(43)



if c

a,c(fb,cfa,b) = b,c(fb,c)a,b(fa,b).

is the category of vector spaces and linear maps, then  is a representation of the

category c.

a classical result of wigner tells us that in quantum systems we must content ourselves

with projective representations of symmetry groups. similarly, with the fock functor we

have to consider projective category representations. this means that there is essentially

a scalar ambiguity in the map a,b, so that (43) is replaced by

(44)

a,c(fb,cfa,b) = c(fb,c, fa,b)b,c(fb,c)a,b(fa,b),

where the cocycle c(fb,c, fa,b) takes values in c  {0}. to explain the meaning here of
essentially, recall that a projective representation of a group g is a true representation
of a extension group g of g by c. the group g forms a c bundle over g whose
lie algebra cocycle is the rst chern class of the associated line bundle. equivalently,
g is dened by assigning to each g  g a complex line lg such that lg1g2 = lg1 

16

jouko mickelsson and simon scott

lg2. (a well-known instance of this occurs for loop groups, see example 4.1 below, and
more generally we shall in section 4 give the gauge group representations for a yang-

mills action functional a similar description.) likewise, a projective representation of a
category is a true representation of an extension category c constructed by assigning to
each fa,b  morc(a, b) a complex line lfa,b, and given fb,c  morc(b, c), an identication

(45)

lfa,b  lfb,c  lfa,bfb,c ,

which is associative in the natural sense. one then has

(46)

ob( c) = ob(c), mor c(a, b) = {(f, ) | f  morc(a, b),   lf }.

3.3. the category cd. an element of ob(cd) is a pair (y, w ), where y = (y, gy , sy 
y ), with y is a closed, smooth and oriented d-dimensional spin manifold, gy a rie-
mannian metric on y , sy a spinor bundle over y , y a hermitian bundle over y with
compatible gauge connection, and w is an admissible polarization of the one-particle
hilbert space hy = w  w  to a pair of closed innite-dimensional subspaces. here
hy = l2(y, sy y ) and admissible means that pw  gry , where pw is the orthogonal
projection onto w and gry is the hilbert-schmidt grassmannian dened with respect
to the energy polarization hy = h +  h  into positive, resp. negative, energies of the
dirac operator dy .

let (yi, wi)  ob(cd), i = 1, 2, where yi = (yi, gyi, syi  yi ). an element of
morcd((y1, w1), (y2, w2)) is a triple x = (x, gx , sx x ), where x smooth and oriented
(d+1)-dimensional spin manifold with boundary x = y1  y2, gx a riemannian metric
on x with (gx )|yi = gyi, sx a spinor bundle and x a hermitian bundle over x with
= sy  yi and the connections
compatible gauge connection, such that (sx  x )|yi
metrics correspond under the isomorphism. we refer to x as a geometric bordism from
y1 to y2. we assume that:

 in a collar neighbourhood of the boundary u = u1  u2, where ui = ([0, 1]  yi)
the geometry of all metrics, connections is a product. recall this means that

near the boundary the metric becomes the product of the standard metric on

the real axis and the boundary metric. similarly, the gauge connection approaches

smoothly the connection on the boundary such that at the boundary all the normal
derivatives vanish. thus x|ui is a pull-back of the boundary bundle (yi ), and
similarly all metrics, connections, etc are pull-backs of their boundary counterparts,
so gx|ui = du2 + gyi etc.

 the orientation on the ingoing boundary y1 is assumed to be induced by the
orientation of x and the inward directed normal vector eld on the boundary,

whereas for the outgoing boundary y2 the orientation is xed by the outward
directed normal vector eld.

for notational brevity we may write si := syi  yi, gi := gyi etc, and s1,2 :=

sx  x , g1,2 := gx etc, in the following.

determinant bundles and fqft

17

we augment cd by including the empty set   ob(cd), and for each (y, w ) 

ob(cd) we also allow  := idb as an element of morcd((y, w ), (y, w )). in particular,
a geometric bordism x  morcd(, (y, w )) means d + 1-dimensional manifold x with
boundary y (plus bundles, connections etc). thus a morphism in cd may have discon-
nected, connected, or empty (i.e. x is closed) boundary, according as y is disconnected,

connected or empty.

for (yi, wi)  ob(cd), i = 1, 2, 3, there is an associative product map

(47)

morc((y1, w1), (y2, w2))  morc((y2, w2), (y3, w3))  morc((y1, w1), (y3, w3))

taking a pair (x1,2, x2,3) to the geometric bordism

(48)

x1,2 y2 x2,3 = (x1,2 y2 x2,3, g1,2  g2,3, s1,2  s2,3).

this sewing together of bundles is dened in the usual way. briey, the collar neighbour-
hood ur = [0, 1)  y2 of the boundary of y2 in x2,3 is a copy of the collar neighbourhood
ul = (1, 0]  y2 of the boundary of y2 in x1,2 but with orientation reversed. hence we
may glue together the manifolds x1,2 and x2,3 along y2 to get the doubled manifold
x1,2 y2 x2,3 with a tubular neighbourhood of the partition y2 which we may parameter-
ize as u = (1, 1)  y2. associated to the geometric data we have dirac operators d1,2
and d2,3 acting respectively on sections of the cliord bundles s1,2 and s2,3. over ul the
operator d1,2 takes the product form (/u+dy2), because of the change of orientation
(d2,3)|ur = (/v + dy2 )1. over y2 we construct s1,2  s2,3 by gluing s1,2 to s2,3
via the unitary isomorphism , identifying s  (s1,2)|y with s  (s2,3)|y . (thus for the
case of chiral spinors the isomorphism  takes positive to negative spinors.) a section of
s1,2  s2,3 is a pair (, ) with  (resp. ) is a smooth section of s1,2 (resp. of s2,3) such
that the normal derivatives of all orders match-up:
uk (0, y).
we then have the doubled dirac-type operator (d1,2  d2,3)(, ) = (d1,2, d2,3)
acting on c(x1,2 y2 x2,3, s1,2  s2,3), which is well-dened since from the product
form (9) it can be easily checked that d1,2 and d2,3 match up at the boundary.

k
uk (0, y) = (1)k(y) k

3.4. the category cgr. an element of ob(cgr) is a pair (h, w ) with h a hilbert
space, and w a polarization of h into a pair of closed orthogonal innite-dimensional
subspaces h = w  w . a morphism (e, )  morcgr ((h1, w 
1 ), (h2, w2)) is a closed
subspace e  h1  h2 such that pe  pw 
1 w2 is a hilbert-schmidt operator, where
1  w2 respectively, along
pe, pw 
with an element  of the relative determinant line det (w 
1 w2, e). (it is convenient here
to use the reverse polarization w 
1 of h1 in order to account for boundary orientations
later on, see below). thus there is an identication

1 w2 are the orthogonal projections with range e, w 

(49)

morcgr ((h1, w 

1 ), (h2, w2)) = det w 

1 w2 ,

where the right-side is the determinant line bundle based at w 
1 w2 over the trace-class
grassmannian gr(h 1  h2), where h 1 serves to remind us that we are considering the

18

reverse polarization w 
1 w2 = det w 
det w 
also allow   ob(cgr) as an object, and dene

1 ; we may write gr(h 1  h2) = gr(h 1  h2, w 
1  w2) and
1 w2 (h 1  h2) if we wish to emphasize the polarization. we

(50)

morcgr (, (h, w )) = det w (h), morcgr ((h, w ), ) = det w  (h)

morcgr (, ) = c.

to dene the product of morphisms in cgr, rst recall when h0 6=  6= h2, from the

category of linear relations, the join product rule

(51)

gr(h 0  h1, w 

0  w1)  gr(h 1  h2,fw 

(e01, e12) 7 e01  e12,

1  w2)  gr(h 0  h2, w 

0  w2),

wherefw1  gr(h1, w1), dened by

e01  e12 = {(u, v)  h0  h2 |  w  h1 such that (u, w)  e12, (w, v)  e23}.

the join is a generalized composition law of graphs of linear operators, but here the

morphisms e are not in general everywhere dened, but dom(e) = range(ph1 pe :
e  h1), and may also be multi-valued. the composition may therefore be dis-
(i) the map
continous. from [22] we recall that for continuity one requires that:
e01  e12  h1, ((u, w), (w
is surjective, and (ii) e01  e12  h0  h1 
h2, ((u, w), (w

, v) is injective. the crucial fact is the following:

proposition 3.1. with the above notation, when (h0, w 
0 ) =  = (h2, w2) there is a
canonical pairing, linear and holomorphic on the bres in the rst and second variables,

(52)

if w1 =fw1, then

where the horizontal maps are the obvious ones. we know from [22, 20] that such a

diagram denes an isomorphism between the determinant line of the centre map with

the tensor product of the lines dened by the outer columns, mapping the determinant

elements to each other. hence since det (id) = c canonically, the isomorphism follows,

and in particular with e = w1 and e

(det(ide01), det(ide12 ) = det(ide01e12 ).

from (56) and the identication (49) we now have a canonical multiplication

morcgr ((h0, w 

0 ), (h1, w1))  morcgr ((h1, w

 morcgr ((h0, w

is precisely equation (52).

3.5. the projective functor cd  cgr. we dene a projective functor  : cd  cgr
as follows. we have

(65)

 : ob(cd)  ob(cgr),

(y, w ) 7 (hy , w ),

where as before hy = l2(y, sy  y ) and w is an admissible polarization. while for
(y1, w1), (y2, w2)  ob(cd)

(66)

 : mor cd

((y1, w1), (y2, w2))  mor cgr

((h y1, w 

1 ), (hy2 , w2))

x 7 (k12, ),

where k12  hy1  hy2 is the calderon subspace of boundary traces of solutions to
the dirac operator d1,2 over x dened by the geometric data in x , and   det (w 
1 
w2, k12) = det (d1,2
). taking into account that y1 is an incoming boundary, we
have k12  gr(h y1 hy2; w 

1 w2) (in fact, an element of the smooth grassmannian).

pw

,w2

the choice needed of the element  means that  is a true functor bcd  cgr, where bcd

is the extension category of cd whose objects are the same as cd, and

(y1, y2) = {(x , z) | x  morcd(y1y2),   det (w 

1  w2, k12)}.

for a closed geometric bordism x  morcd(, ) we set

morccd

(67)

(68)

(, ) = det (dx ),

morccd

the projectivity of the functor in this case corresponds to a choice of generator det (dx ) =
c = morcgr (, ).

to see the functor respects the product rules in each category, it is enough to show
that k01 k12 is the calderon subspace of the operator d0,1 d1,2, i.e. k(d0,1 d1,2) =
k(d0,1)k(d1,2) dened by morphisms x0,1, x1,2. this, however, is immediate from the
denition of d0,1  d1,2, and the fact that given   ker d0,1,   ker d1,2 it is enough
for their boundary values to match up in order to get an element of ker (d0,1  d1,2).
that in turn follows because the product geometry in the collar neighbourhood u of the

outgoing boundary y1 of x0,1 implies that  has the form (u, y) =pk ekuk(0)ek(y),

where {k, ek} is a spectral resolution of hy1 dened by the boundary dirac operator. (to
be quite correct, we should also include the identication by the boundary isomorphism
(y) in the denition of the join k01  k12, but this introduces no new phenomena.)
thus the requirement (45) for the rule x 7 det (w 
1  w2, k12) to dene a projective
extension of cgr, is precisely (56) of proposition 3.1.

3.6. the functor cgr  cvect. the functor  from the category cgr to the category
cvect of (z-graded) vector spaces and linear maps, is dened on objects of cgr by

(69)

(h, w )  fw = fw (h)

(h, w )  fw  = fw (h)

  c,

thus  takes a polarized vector space to the fock space dened by the polarization, and
f = c is by at. here fw  = fw (h) := hol(gr(h), det w  ) is the fock space
associated with the reverse polarization.

22

 is dened on morphisms as follows. from (49), an element of morcgr ((h1, w 

1 ), (h2, w2))

is the same thing as an element   det w 
(e, ) where   det (w 
canonical vector

1 w2 , which we may think of as the pair
1  w2, e). by the plucker embedding (27) this gives us a

(70)

  fw 

1 w2 (h 1  h2) = fw 

1

(h 1)  fw2(h2).

the isomorphism is immediate from (36) and fw(h) = f (h, w ), the completion of
f (h, w ).

to proceed we need the following facts, generalizing eqn.(8.10) of [22]:

proposition 3.2. the determinant bundle pairing  of proposition 3.1 denes a canon-

ical fock space pairing

(, ) = (,).

in particular,

(76)

(w

) = w 

0 w2  det(pw2,w0 ).

proof. first notice that in the nite-dimensional case there is a natural isomorphism
between the fock space (the exterior algebra) and its dual dened by the pairing kh 
nkh  det (h), (1, 2) 7 1  2, while in the innite-dimensional case the
pairing using the car construction follows directly from the denition f (h, w ) =
(w )  ((w )). for the geometric fock space fw , the construction of the pairing
from the determinant bundle pairing  on det w  det w  is entirely analogous to the
construction of the inner-product < , >w on fw from the determinant bundle pairing
g on det w  det w in equation (26). indeed, in the case of the vacuum elements the
two pairings are canonically identied (see (78) below and section 5).

let us deal rst with the case (71). we give rst the invariant denition, and then

the constructive denition along the lines of < , >w in section 2.

invariantly, in

the case w1 = fw1, the pairing  : det w1  det w 

 : det w1  0  fw 
by (a)( . ) = f (a,
(f )( . ) = f (( . )). this gives us a pairing f 

 c denes an embedding

6.2). the general case follows in the same way with c replaced by det (fw1, w1).
of the [,], with [, ]  det w . hence for [, ]  det w1 , [, ]  detfw 

constructively, recall that any section in fw can be written as a linear combination
we can

dene the fock pairing by setting

1

(77)

([,], [,]) = ([,], [,])  det (fw1, w1),

and then extending by linearity. in particular, from (30) we have w1 = [idw1 ,1] and

1

fw 

= [idfw 

1

,1], and so

(w1 , fw 

1

) = (det(idw1 ), det(idfw 

1

)) = det(pfw1,w1

),

where the nal equality is equation (59). notice further that if we extend g in (26)

 det (fw1, w1) by g([, ], [, ]) = det(pw ),
to a map g : det w1  detfw1
then the fock space inner-product becomes a hermitian pairing < , , >w1 : fw1 ffw1
det (fw1, w1) and with respect to the identication gr(h, w1)  gr(h 1, w 
w  we have fw 


1 ), w 

 fw1

and

1

(78)

(w1 , fw 

1

) =< w1 , fw1

>w1= det(pfw1,w1

).

the pairing (74) now follows from (71) and (70). alternatively we can dene it directly

as ([,], [,]) = ([,],[,]), where  is the pairing (54). note that if conditions (i)
and (ii) do not hold then ([, ], [, ]) = 0. equation (75) is now just by construction,

and equation (76) follows easily from (62).

the fock space pairing (73) denes an isomorphism fw 
(h 1)  fw2 (h2) dened by   morcgr ((h1, w 

w1 and hence the vector
  fw 
1 ), (h2, w2)) is canonically an
element of hom(fw1 (h1), fw2 (h2)) which is a morphism of cvect, as required. in the
case (h 0, w 
0 ) =  the map morcgr (, (h1, w1))  hom(c, fw1) is dened by 1 7 w ,
and similarly when (h2, w2) = . the functoriality of the composition of linear maps
with respect to the multiplication in cgr is precisely (75). we may state this as:

1

= f 

theorem 3.3. the category multiplication in cgr induces through the fock space func-
tor a canonical multiplication in the category cvect.

this can be conveniently summarized in the statement that the following diagram

commutes:

3.7. the fock functor. the fock functor z : cd  cvect is the projective functor
dened by the composition of the functors  and , thus z is the functor

(79)

z acts on objects of ecd by

(80)

z =    : ecd  cvect.
z : ob(ecd)  ob(cvect),

z((y, w )) = fw (hy ),

z() = c,

and on morphisms by

(81)

z : morecd

((y1, w1), (y2, w2))  morecd

z((x , )) = ,

  det (w 

1  w2, k(dx)),

(fw1 (hy1 ), fw2 (hy2 )),

where (y1, w1),(y2, w2) are not both empty, and  is dened as in section 3.6 by the
fock space pairing. if (y1, w1) =  = (y2, w2), so x is a closed manifold, then

z(x ) = det(dx )  det (dx ) = c,

where the trivialization requires a choice.

the sewing property of the fqft is precisely the functorial fock space pairing of
proposition 3.2. note that if both wi 6=  it is not possible to choose  to be the vacuum
1 w2 , since k(dx), depending on global data, is always transverse
vector w 
to the pure boundary data w 
1  w2. consider though the case w1 = . let x be a
closed connected manifold partitioned by an embedded codimension 1 submanifold y ,
so that x = x 0 y x 1. here x 0, x 1 are manifolds with boundary y , where x 0 = y
has outgoing orientation and x 1 = y has incoming orientation. x 0 is assumed to be
associated to a morphism x 0 in morcd(, (y, w )) for a choice of admissible polarization
w  gr(hy ). in this case we can choose in particular w = k(d0) and  = k(d0).
similarly, we have x 1  morcd((y, w ), ), and we may choose w  = k(d1). as a
corollary of the properties of z we then have the following algebraic sewing law for the

determinant with respect to a partitioned closed manifold.

theorem 3.4. there are functorial bilinear pairings

(82)

( , ) : fk(d0)(hy )  fw (h y )  det (d0

pw ),

where the right-side is the determinant line of the ebvp dp with

(83)

and

(84)

(k(d0), w ) = det(d0

p ),

( , ) : fk(d0)(hy )  fk(d1)(h y )  det (dx ),

where the right-side is the determinant line of the dirac operator dx over the closed
manifold x, with

(85)

(k(d0), k(d1)) = det(dx ).

proof. we just need to recall a couple of facts. from equations (71) and (72) we
have a pairing fk(d0)(hy )  fw (h y )  det (k(d0), w ) with (k(d0), w  ) =
det(s(pw )), where s(pw ) : k(d0)  w is the operator of section 2. but from
(14) there is a canonical isomorphism det (s(pw )) = det (dpw ), with det(s(pw )) 7
det(dp,b). this proves the rst statement. the second statement follows similarly upon
recalling from [20] (theorem 3.2) that there is a canonical isomorphism det ((ip (d1)
p (d0)) = det (dx ), again preserving the determinant elements.

thus one may think of the determinant det(dp ) classically as an object in the com-
plex line det (k(d), p ) depending on a choice of boundary condition p , or absolutely as
a quantum determinant as a ray in the fock space fk(d) dened by the vacuum vector
that does not depend on a choice of p . the two view points being related by (83).

finally, we point out that, in particular, the fock functor naturally denes a map

from geometric brations to vector bundles. to a geometric bration n of closed d-

dimensional manifolds endowed with a spectral section p it assigns the corresponding
fock bundle fp. a projective morphism between objects (n1, p1) and (n2, p2) is a
geometric bration of m of d + 1-dimensional manifolds with boundary n1  n2 along
with a section of the determinant bundle det (p
1  p2, k(d)), where d is the family
of dirac operators dened by m. this denes a bundle map fp1  fp2 using the
generalized plucker embedding (39) and the fock space pairing. for a partition of a
closed geometric bration m = m 0 n m 1 over a parameter manifold b by an embedded
bration of codimension 1 manifolds, the analogue of theorem 3.4 then states that there

are functorial fock bundle pairings:

(86)

( , ) : fp (d0)  fp  det (d0, p),

(p (d0), p) = det(d0

p),

where the right-side is the determinant line bundle of the family of ebvp (d0, p), p
is the vacuum section of the fock bundle fp and det(d0
p) the determinant section of
det (d0, p); and

(87)

( , ) : fp (d0)  fp (d1)  det (dm),

(k(d0), k(d1)) = det(dm).

26

jouko mickelsson and simon scott

the proof again requires only the properties of the fock bundle pairing and the deter-

minant bundle identications of section 2 and [20]. notice that there is no regularization

here of the determinant, but only a pairing between bundle sections.

4. gauge anomalies and the fock functor

in this section we give a physical application of these ideas with a fock functor

description of the chiral and commutator anomalies for an even-dimensional manifold

with (odd-dimensional) boundary.

the fock functor assigns vector spaces to all odd-dimensional compact oriented spin

manifolds y and polarizations. there is no further restriction on the topology of y.

however, in this section we shall restrict to a xed topological type for y. for our purposes

this is no real restriction since our principal aim is to understand the action of continuous

symmetries, dieomorphisms and gauge transformations, on the family of fock spaces

and on the morphisms between the fock spaces; the action of the symmetry group cannot

change the topological type of y. in order to be even more concrete, to begin with, we

shall consider the case of the parameter space b = a of smooth vector potentials labeling

the geometries over y.

thus we are lead to consider the action of the group of gauge transformations on the

bundle f of fock spaces over the base a. the gauge transformations act naturally on the

base a and thus we have a lifting problem: construct a (projective) action of the gauge

group in the total space of f intertwining with the family of quantized dirac hamiltonians

in the bers. we want to stress that we are not going to construct a representation of the

gauge group in a single fock space but we have have a linear isometric action between

dierent bers of the fock bundle.

first, we recall some known facts about gauge anomalies in even dimensions. let m

be a closed even-dimensional riemannian spin manifold and let a be the space of vector

potentials on a trivial complex g-bundle over m . for each a  a we have a coupled
dirac operator da : c(m ; s  e)  c(m ; s  e) given locally by

da =

nxi=1

i (i + i + ai) ,

where i and ai are respectively the components of the local spin connection and and
g-connection a, and i the cliord matrices. since m is even-dimensional, then da
splits into positive and negative chirality components, and the object of interest is the

chiral dirac operator

d+

a = da(

1 + n+1

2

) : c(m ; s+  e)  c(m ; s  e).

acting on a we have the group of based gauge transformations g, which acts covari-
a). we are

antly on the dirac operators d+

g.a = g1d+

ag, so that kerd

g.a = g(kerd

determinant bundles and fqft

27

interested in the fermionic path integral:

(88)

z(a) =zc(m;s+e)

erm d+

a  dmdd,

and a formal extension of nite-dimensional functional calculus gives

z(a) := det(d+

a).

to obtain an unambiguous regularization of (88) we therefore require a gauge covari-

ant regularized determinant varying smoothly with a in order that z(a) pushes down

smoothly to the moduli space m = a/g.

in the case of dirac fermions (both chi-

rality sectors) this can be done and there is a gauge invariant regularized determinant

detreg(da). for chiral fermions on the other hand, there is an obstruction due to the
presence of zero modes of the dirac operator. the covariance of the kernels means that

the determinant line bundle descends to m and the obstruction to the existence of a

covariant z(a) varying smoothly with a  a is the rst chern class of the determinant

bundle on m, which is the topological chiral anomaly. a 2-form representative for the
chern class det d+ can be constructed as the transgression of the 1-form 1  (g)

1(g) =

1
2i

d(detr(d+
ga)
(detr(d+
ga)

,

measuring the obstruction to gauge covariance of a choice of regularized determinant
detr(d+

a). for details see [2, 14].

in the case of a manifold x with boundary y new complications arise. fixing an

elliptic boundary condition (spectral section) p for the family of chiral dirac operators
d+ = {d+
a : a  a}, we obtain a fock bundle fp over a to which we aim to lift the g
action. it is natural to look rst at gauge transformations (or dieomorphisms) which

are trivial on the boundary.

in fact, the calculation of the chern class in [2] can be

extended to this case using a version of the families index theory for a manifold with

boundary, [5, 16]. the gauge variation of the chiral determinant can be written as

(89)

detr(d+

g.a) = detr(d+

a)(g; a)

where log  is an integral over x of a local dierential polynomial in g, a and the metric

on x;  is the integrated version of the innitesimal anomaly form 1. the important
point is that the formula applies both to the case of a manifold with/without boundary.

in fact, in the latter case this gives a direct way to dene the determinant bundle over

a/g, [13].

the locality of the anomaly (89) is compatible with the formal sewing formula (105).

applying a gauge transformation which is trivial on y to the right-hand-side of the

equation gives a gauge variation which is a product of gauge variations on the two halves

x0, x1 of m. this product is equal, by locality of the logarithm, to the gauge variation
on m of the path integral on the left-hand-side. since the cutting surface y is arbitrary,

one can drop the requirement that g is trivial on y.

28

jouko mickelsson and simon scott

the gauge transformations (and dieomorphisms) which are not trivial on the bound-

ary need a dierent treatment. this is because they act non-trivially on the boundary
fock spaces fy . we shall concentrate on the case when y is odd dimensional. the rst
question to ask is how the action of the gauge group on the parameter space b of bound-

ary geometries on y is lifted to the total space of the bundle of fock spaces f  b.

this problem has already been analyzed (leading to schwinger terms in the lie algebra

of the group g) in the literature, but in the present article we want to clarify how the

boundary action intertwines with the fock functor construction.

4.1. commutator anomaly on the boundary. let b  b and w  grb. in the rest
of this section b denotes the space of metrics and vector potentials on a xed manifold

y and yb is the manifold y equipped with the geometric data b. the pair (b, w ) is
mapped to (g.b, g.w ) by a gauge transformation (or a dieomorphism) g, acting on

both potentials, metrics and spinor elds. this induces an unitary map from the fock
space f (hb, w ) to f (hg.b, g.w ), by a(u) 7 a(g  u) and similarly for the annihilation
operators.

however, sometimes (b, w ) do not appear independently, but w is given as a function
of the boundary geometry; b  pw =wb is a grassmann section; this leads to the con-
struction of the bundle of fock spaces fb parameterized by b  b, as already mentioned
above. an example of this situation is the following. suppose the dirac operators on the

boundary do not have zero eigenvalue (this happens when massive fermions are coupled
to vector potentials). then it is natural to take wb = h +
b as the space of positive energy
states. still this case does not lead to any complications because of the equivariance

property wg.b = g.wb. however, there are cases when no equivariant choices for wb
exist. this happens when we have massless chiral fermions coupled to gauge potentials.

for some potentials there are always zero modes and one cannot take wb as the positive
energy subspace without introducing discontinuities into the construction.

let us assume that a grassmann section wb is given. for each boundary geome-
try b we have a fermionic fock space fb = f (hb, wb) determined by the polarization
hyb = wb  w 
b . in order to determine the obstruction to lifting the gauge group action
on y to the bundle of fock spaces such that g1dyb g = dyg.b we compare the action
on f to the natural action in the case of polarizations w 
b dened by the positive energy
subspaces of dirac operators dyb  . we have xed a real parameter  and we consider
only those boundary geometries b  b for which  is not an eigenvalue. since the choice
of polarizations w  is equivariant, the gauge action lifts to the (local) fock bundle f .
relative to w the f  vacua form a complex line bundle det (w , w ); again, this is
dened only locally in the parameter space.

example 4.1 let y be a unit circle with standard metric but varying gauge potentials.
we can choose hy = w  w  as the xed polarization dened by the decomposition to
positive and negative fourier modes. if the gauge group is su (n) and fermions are in

determinant bundles and fqft

29

the fundamental representation of su (n) then the mapping g 7 g  w denes an embed-

ding of the loop group lsu (n) to the hilbert-schmidt grassmannian gr1(hy , w ). the
pull-back of the quillen determinant bundle over the grassmannian to lsu (n) denes

the central extension of the loop group with level k = 1, [17].

there is a general method to describe the relative determinant bundle in terms of index

theory on x for x = y. we assume that the spin and gauge vector bundle on y can
be smoothly continued to bundles on x. this is the case for example when x = s2n1
and y is chosen such that it has the topology of a solid ball, with a product metric near

the boundary. any vector potential can be smoothly continued to a potential on x for

example as a(x, r) = f (r)a(x) with f increasing smoothly from zero to the value one

at r = 1; all derivatives of f vanishing at r = 0, 1. we can now dene a spectral section
b 7 wb as the calderon subspace associated to the continued metric and vector potential
in the bulk; we denote the dirac operator dened by this geometric data in x by dx,b.
the determinant line for a dirac operator dx,b subject to the boundary condition w is
canonically the tensor product of the line det (w , w ) and the determinant line of the
same operator dx,b but subject to another choice of boundary conditions w , (12)

since the spectral section wb and the dirac operator dx,b is parameterized by the
ane space of geometric data (metrics and potentials) on the boundary, the correspond-
ing dirac determinant bundle is topologically trivial. let u be the set of b  b such
that the real number  is not in the spectrum of the corresponding dirac operator dyb .
on u we can dene the boundary conditions w 
z, as the spectral subspace dyb >  of
the boundary dirac operator. the set u is in general non-contractible and the dirac
determinant line bundle dened by the boundary conditions w  can be nontrivial. the
curvature of this bundle is given by the families index theorem [5, 16]. it can be written

in terms of characteristic classes in the bulk and the so-called -form on the boundary;

the latter depends on spectral information about the family of dirac operators. the

curvature  when evaluated along gauge and dieomorphism directions on the boundary

data has a simplied expression; in particular, the -form drops out since it is a spectral

invariant and the contribution from the characteristic classes in the bulk reduces to a

boundary integral involving the (gauge and metric) chern-simons forms, [7, 8]:

means a connection form on y  b such that in the y directions it is given by a vector
potential a and in the gauge directions lu on b it is equal to the lie algebra valued
function u. in a similar way,  + w is the sum of the levi-civita connection (on y ) and a
metric connection w such that the value of w along a vector eld lu on b, generated by

30

a vector eld u on y , is equal to the matrix valued function on y given by the jacobian

of the vector eld u.

sinh(ir/4)(cid:19)

ch(x) = tr (exp(if/2))

where r is the riemann curvature tensor associated to a metric g in the bulk, f is the

curvature of a gauge connection a.

from the previous discussion it follows that the topological information (de rham
cohomology class of the curvature) in the relative determinant bundle det (w , w ) is
given by the curvature formula for the dirac determinant bundle for boundary polar-
ization w . this leads to the explicit formula for lifting the gauge and dieomorphism
group action from the base b = am to the fock bundle f , [7], [8]. innitesimally, the

lifting leads to an extension of the lie algebras lie(g) and v ect(y ) by an abelian ideal

j consisting of complex valued functions on a  m. the commutator of two pairs of

elements (u, f ) and (v, g) (where f, g are in the extension part j and u, v are innitesimal

gauge transformations or vector elds) is given as

(91)

[(u, f ), (v, g)] = ([u, v], lu  g  lv  f + c(u, v))

where c(u, v) is an anti-symmetric bilinear function of the arguments u, v taking values

in the ideal j. it satises the cocycle condition

(92)

c(u1, [u2, u3]) + lu1  c(u2, u3) + cyclic permutations = 0.

the cocycle c is just the curvature form evaluated along gauge (or dieomorphism group)

directions,

c(u, v) = (lu, lv)

where lu is the vector eld on a (resp. m) generated by the gauge (dieomorphism)
group action. when y is one-dimensional, the cocycle reduces to the central term in an

ane lie algebra or in the virasoro algebra; in this case the cocycle does not depend on

the vector potential or the metric on y. in dimension 3 the cocycle (schwinger term) is

given as [12, 9]

(93)

c(u, v) =

i

242zy

tr a[du, dv]

when the fermions are in the fundamental representation of the gauge group; here u, v :

y  g are smooth innitesimal gauge transformations. in dimension 3 the cocycle is

trivial in case of vector elds and metrics. also in higher dimensions explicit expressions

can be worked out starting from (90), [8].

the curvature of the relative determinant bundle, in the case of grassmann sections

w, w  discussed above, can be written as

mannian, the rst term is the standard formula for the curvature of the grassmannian.

is the projection

the second term can be viewed as a renormalization; it is in fact a background eld

dependent vacuum energy subtraction.

the proof of the curvature formula (94) is as follows. first, one notices that this gives
the curvature of the relative determinant bundle when both variables wb, w 
b lie in the
same restricted grassmannian relative to a xed base point p0. then one has to show
that the dierence actually makes sense when dropping the existence of common base

point. for that purpose one writes

(u, v) = tr [(f 

b  fb)luf 

blvf 

b + fb(luf

b + fblufb(lvf

which is manifestly a trace of a sum of trace-class operators.

4.2. chiral anomaly in the bulk. in the construction of the fock functor we took as
independent parameter a choice of an element   det (k(d+
b ), wyb ) in the boundary
determinant bundle; recall that k(d+
b ) is the range of the calderon projection. a choice
of this element, as a function of the geometric data in the bulk, is a section of the

determinant bundle. in quantum eld theory such a choice is provided by a choice of
the regularized determinant of the chiral dirac operator d+
b . the determinant vanishes
if and only if the orthogonal projection  : k(d+
b )  wyb is singular and therefore
it makes sense to choose  = b  det (k(d+
b ), wyb ) (represented as an admissible
linear map b : wyb  k(d+
b ), dened subject to the boundary
conditions wb, is equal to detf (  b).

b )) such that detr(d+

in the case of chiral fermions the determinant detr(d+

b ) is anomalous with respect to
dieomorphisms and gauge transformations on x and the variation of the determinant

is given by the factor (g; b) in (89). this implies the transformation rule

(95)

g.b = b  (g; b)

where g is either a gauge transformation or a dieomorphism and b stands for both the

metric and gauge potential on x.  is a non-vanishing complex function, satisfying the

cocycle condition

(96)

(g1g2; b) = (g1; g2  b)(g2; b).

here the boundary conditions should be invariant under g, meaning that the gauge

transformations (and dieomorphism) approach smoothly the identity at the boundary.

if the cocycle  is nontrivial (and this is the generic case for chiral fermions) in coho-

mology, then the relation (89) above tells us that the fock functor is determined by the
family of calderon subspaces k(d+
b ) and a choice of a section (the regularized determi-
nant) of a nontrivial line bundle over the quotient space b of b modulo dieomorphisms

and gauge transformations.

example 4.2 let a(d) be the space of smooth potentials in a unit disk d. let

g(d, d) be the group of gauge transformations which are trivial on the boundary
d = s1. for each a  a(d) there is a unique g = ga : d  g such that a =
g1ag + g1dg is in the radial gauge, ar = 0, and g(p) = 1, where p  s1 is a
it follows that b = a(d)/g(d, d) can be identied
xed point on the boundary.
as arad(d)  g(d)/g(d, d) = arad  g, where arad(d) is the set of potentials in
the radial gauge and g is the group of based loops, i.e., those loops in g which take
the value 1 at the point p. the rst factor arad(d) is topologically trivial as a vector
space. thus in this case the topology of the dirac determinant bundle over the moduli

space b is given by the pull-back of the canonical line bundle over g, [17], with respect
to the map a 7 ga|d. the sections of det  b are by denition complex functions
 : a(d)  c which obey the anomaly condition (89), [13].

4.3. relation of the chiral anomaly to the commutator anomaly. the bulk

anomaly and the extension (schwinger terms) of the gauge group on the boundary are

closely related, [13]. as we saw above, the fock functor is determined by a choice of a
section b  b of the relative line bundle det (k(d+
b ), wyb ). the section transforms
according to the chiral transformation law for regularized determinants,

gb = (g; b)b,

for transformations g which are equal to the identity on the boundary. if now h is a

transformation which is not equal to the identity on the boundary, we can dene an

operator t (h) acting on sections by

(97)

(t (h))(b) = (h; b)(h1  b),

where  is a complex function of modulus one and must be chosen in such a way that
(b) = (t (h))(b) satises the condition (89). explicit expressions for  have been
worked out in several cases, [14]. for example, if dimx = 2 and g is a gauge transfor-

mation then

(98)

(h; a) = exp(

i

2zx

tr a dhh1),

where tr is the trace in the representation of the gauge group determined by the action

on fermions. in general,  must satisfy the consistency condition,

(99)

(h; g  b)(hgh1; h1  b) = (h; b)(g; b).

in the two-dimensional gauge theory example,

(100)

(g; a) = exp(

i

2zx

tr adgg1 +

i

24z tr (dgg1)3).

determinant bundles and fqft

33

the latter integral is evaluated over a 3-manifold m such that its boundary is the closed

2-manifold obtained from x by shrinking all its boundary components to a point.

the introduction of the factor  in (97) has the consequence that the composition law

for the group elements is modied,

(101)

t (g1)t (g2) = (g1, g2; z)t (g1g2),

where  is a s1 valued function, dened by

(102)

(g1, g2; b) = (g1g2; b)(g1; b)1(g2; g1

1  b).

thus we have extended the original group of gauge transformations (dieomorphisms)

by the abelian group of circle valued functions on the parameter space b.

at the lie algebra level, the relation (101) leads to a modied commutator (by

schwinger terms discussed above) of the naive commutation relations of the algebra

of innitesimal gauge transformations or the algebra of vector elds on the manifold x.

actually, the modication is sitting on the boundary; the action of t (g) was dened in

such a way that the (normal) subgroup of gauge transformations which are equal to the

identity on the boundary acts trivially on the sections (b). there is an additional slight

twist to this statement. actually, the normal subgroup is embedded in the extended

group as the set of pairs (g, c(g)), where c(g) is the circle valued function dened by

(103)

c(g) = (g; b)1(g; b).

the consistency condition (99) guarantees that the multiplication rule

(g1, c(g1))(g2, c(g2)) = (g1g2, c(g1g2)),

holds in the extended group with the multiplication law

(g1, 1)(g2, 2) = (g1g2, (g1, g2)12

g1 ),

where (g(b) = (g1b).

4.4. summary. let us summarize the above discussion on fock functors and group

extensions. on the boundary manifold y = x a choice of boundary conditions wb
(labeled by a parameter space by of boundary geometries) denes a fermionic fock space
fyb. the group of gauge transformations (or dieomorphisms) on y acts in the bundle
of fock spaces (parameterized by geometric data on the boundary) through an abelian

extension; the lie algebra of the extension is determined by a 2-cocycle (schwinger terms)

b, wb) where w 

which are computed via index theory from the curvature of the relative determinant
bundles det (w 
b is the positive energy subspace dened by the boundary
dirac operator. if the boundary is written as a union y = yin  yout of the ingoing
and outgoing components then the fock functor assigns to the geometric data on x a
linear operator zx : fin  fout. a gauge transformation in the bulk x sends zx to
(g; x)zg1x . this action denes an abelian extension of the gauge group. there is a
normal subgroup isomorphic to the group of gauge transformations which are equal to

the identity on the boundary. this subgroup acts trivially, therefore giving an action

34

jouko mickelsson and simon scott

of (the abelian extension of) the quotient group on the boundary. the latter group is

isomorphic to the group acting in the fock bundle over boundary geometries.

5. path integral formulae and a 0+1-dimensional example

in this section we outline the fermionic path integral formalism for an ebvp and

explain how the fock functor models this algebraically.

5.1. path integral formulae. the analogue of (88) for an ebvp is

(104)

zx (p ) := det(dp ) =zep

erx d dmdd,

where ep = dom(dp ). this is equation (4) for the case s() =rx d dx and where

the local boundary condition f has been replaced by the global boundary condition p . if
we consider a partition of the closed manifold m = x0y x1. the dirac operator over m
restricts to dirac operators d0 over x 0 and d1 over x 1. we assume that the geometry
is tubular in a neighbourhood of the splitting manifold y , then we have grassmannians
gry i of boundary conditions associated to di, where y 1 = y = y 0. the reversal of
orientation means that there is a dieomorphism gry 0  gry 1 given by p  i  p , so
that each p  gry 0 denes the boundary value problems d0
ip . according to
(88) and (104), the analogue of the sewing formula (105) is

p and d1

of course, the above formulas are only heuristic extensions to innite-dimensions of

a well-dened nite-rank linear functional. according to the properties of the fock

functor (see section 3), the fermionic integral may be rigourously understood as a linear
functional (hy  h y )  det (d0
p ), while (107) is replaced by the evaluation of the
fock space bilinear pairing on vacuum elements (84):

(108)

det(d) = (k(d0), k(d1)).

determinant bundles and fqft

35

however, adopting a slightly dierent point of view gives a more precise meaning to the

integral formulae above. with a given boundary condition p the determinants of the

(chiral) dirac operators on the manifolds x0 and x1 should be interpreted as elements
of the determinant line bundle det over the grassmannian gry , with base point h +.
the actual numerical value of the dirac determinant depends on the choice of a (local)

trivialization. for example, one could dene det(d) as the zeta function regularized
determinant det((db)da), where db is a background dirac operator chosen in such
a way that (db)da has a spectral cut, i.e., there is a cone in the complex plane with
vertex at the origin and no eigenvalues of the operator lie inside of the cone. the value

of the zeta determinant will depend on the choice of the background eld b.

a choice of an element in the line in det over p 0  gry is given by a choice of
a pair (, ), where  : h+  p 0 is a unitary map and   c. it can be viewed as a
holomorphic section of the dual determinant bundle det  according to (29),

[,]() = detf (    ),

where  : (h+)  p 0 is the orthogonal projection. we can think of the variable  as the
parameter for dierent elements w = (h+)  gry . we want to replace the (ill-dened)

integralrgry

(109)

det(d0

p )det(d1

p )dp by a (so far ill-dened) integral of the form

z

[,]()[,]()d.

but this integral looks like the functional integral dening the inner product between a

pair of fermionic wave functions (vectors in the fock space) dened in equation (38):

(110)

detf () =< [,], [,] >=xss

,((s))[,]((s)).

the relation with (108) is given by the identity (78) which tells us that

(111)

(k(d0), k(d1)) =< k(d0), k(d1) >,

k 1 p 

so here [, ] = det(pk 0 pk 0 ), [, ] = det(p 
k 1 ). to illustrate this consider the
case of the dirac operator over an odd-dimensional spin manifold m partitioned by
y . in this case we know from [19] that k(d0) = graph(h0 : f +  f ) and k(d1) =
graph(h1 : f   f +), where f  denotes the spaces of positive and negative spinor elds
over the even-dimensional boundary y , and h0 is a unitary isomorphism diering from
g+ = (d
y are the boundary chiral dirac
operators which we assume to be invertible. in particular, h + = graph(g+ : f +  f ).
similarly for h1 ,with g+ = (d+
y . the graph description gives us a canonical
trivialization of the determinant lines, so that

36

jouko mickelsson and simon scott

then by the denition (58) of the fock pairing we have in this case, with respect to the

trivialization,

(112)

(k(d0), k(d1)) = detf (

1
2

(p (d0)  (i  p (d1) : k(d0)  k(d1)  hy )

where the 1/2 arises (as can be shown canonically) because f + is not quite an element
of the grassmannian. this is the operator

(p (d0)  (i  p (d1))((s+, h0s+), (h1s, s)) = ((s+  h1s, h0s + s))

h0

=  idf +
idf ! = detf (

so in the graph trivialization

(k(d0), k(d1)) = detf

using the formula detf a b

d! = det(d)det(a  bd1c), valid for matrices of the form

on the other hand, using (110), in the trivialization given:

1

< k(d0), k(d1) >= detf

h0) = detf (

where t =  +

t +! where the column index labels the dierent vectors of the canonical

basis for the the graph of t : f +  f , and the row labels of + label the dierent
coordinates of a suitable basis for f +. the complex number detf ( 1
2 (i  h1h2)) is the so
called canonical regularization of dm relative to the partition y (see [19]). there is a
corresponding trivialization for self-adjoint ebvp and its relation with the -determinant

regularization is explained in [21].

5.2. a (0+1)-dimensional example. the motivation for replacing the integration
formula (109) by the sum in (38) comes from nite dimensions. if h = h  h+ is a
decomposition of a 2n dimensional vector space into a pair of orthogonal n dimensional
subspaces then the maps , ,  above become (with respect to the basis {ei} with i =
1, 2,     n ) 2n  n matrices and we have the matrix identity

det() =x(i)

det((i))det((i)),

the sum being over all sequences n  i1 < i2 . . . in  n (with i 6= 0). on the other
hand, it follows from eq. (3.48) in [10], that the following integration formula holds in

this situation:

(113)

det() = anz dddet()det()  det()2n 1,

where an is a numerical factor and the last factor under the integral sign can be incor-
porated to the denition of the integration measure. if we consider the basis elements
, h0 for linear maps hi : h +  h  and integrate over the dense subspace ugraph
h1

1

determinant bundles and fqft

37

parameterizing the elements t = (+, t ) with t  hom(h +, h ), the integral (113)
becomes

(114)

det(1  h2h1) = anz dt dt deth+ (1  h2t )deth (1 + t h2)  det(1 + t t )2n 1,

this has consequences for determinants in dimension one, where the we work with

the compact grassmannian. let x = [a0, a1] and let e be a complex hermitian bundle
over x with unitary connection . then the associated generalized dirac operator is
simply d = id/dx : c(x; e)  c(x; e). choosing a trivialization of e, so that
ea0  ea1 = cn  cn, a global boundary condition d is specied by an element p 
gr(cncn), dening the elliptic boundary value problem: dp = id/dx : dom(dp ) 
l2([a0, a1]; e).

the fock functor is here is a topological 0+1-dimensional fqft from the category
c1, whose objects are points endowed with a complex nite-dimensional hermitian vec-
tor space v (we do not need to give a polarization in this nite-dimensional situation),

and whose morphisms are compact 1-dimensional manifolds with boundary with her-
mitian bundle with unitary connection. the fock functor z takes an object (p, v )  c1
to the fock space z(p, v ) := hol(gr(v ); (det (e))) = v , where e is the usual
canonical vector bundle over the grassmannian. consider two compatible morphisms
01 = ([a0, a1], e01, 01) and 12 = ([a1, a2], e12, 12) in c1, so that

02 = 1201 = ([a0, a2], e02, 02),

with e02|[a0,a1] = e01 etc. let vi be the bre over ai, and in [ai, aj] we assign ai to be
incoming and aj to be outgoing. for incoming boundary components ai the associated
object in c1 is (ai, vi). then we dene z(ij) = kij , where kij  gr(v0  vj) is the
calderon subspace of boundary values of solutions to the dirac operator d = iij
d/dx.
we have

z(ij)  z((pi, v i)(pj, vj )) = z(pi, v i)z(pj, vj ) = (v i)(vj ) = hom(vi, vj ) := fkij .

because kij = graph(hij : vi  vj ) with hij the parallel-transport of the connection
on eij between ai and aj, a simple computation gives under the above identication
z(ij)  hij  hom(vi, vj ). next we have a canonical pairing

(115)

z(a0, v0)  z(a1, v1)  z(a1, v1)  z(a2, v2)  z(a0, v0)  z(a2, v2),

induced by subtraction v1  v1  v1, with h01  h12  h01h12. if we take the
case where a2 = a0, so that 02 = 1201 = (s1 = [a0, a2], e02, 02), corresponding to
morphisms in gr(v0v1) and gr(v1v0) respectively, then z(01)  fk01 and z(10) 
 c, under the above identications is just
fk

hence we have (z(01), z(10)) = det(ih10h01), (since hij is unitary), and (z(01), w 
det(i + t h01). on the other hand it well-known that det(i + t h01) = det(dpt ). so
from eq. (114) we have

t

) =

(117)

(z(01), z(10)) = anz dt dt det(d10

pt )det (d01

pt  )  det(1 + t t )2n 1,

where pt  = i  pt , expressing the relation of the algebraic fock space pairing to the
path integral sewing formula eq. (107).

notice that the gauge group of a boundary component of [a0, a1] is just a copy of the
unitary group u (n) and under the embedding g  graph(g) := wg, the fock functor
maps g to g on v . thus in the case of 0+1-dimensions the fqft representation of the

boundary gauge group is the fundamental u (n)-representation, which is a restatement of

the borel-weil theorem for u (n). this means that the invariant output by the fqft,

which in fact here is a tqft, is the character of the fundamental representation  of

u (n). this is what we would expect. we are dealing with a single particle evolving

through time, and so its only invariants are the representations of its internal symmetry

group, which is the symmetry group of the bundle e over [a, b]. in this sense we are

dealing with quantum mechanics, rather than qft, and because it is a topological eld

theory the hilbert space is nite-dimensional.

5.3. relation to the berezin integral. the above pairing can also be described by

a fermionic integral. let v denote the exterior algebra of the complex vector space

v with odd generators 1, . . . , n. it has basis the monomials i = i1 . . . ip ,
{i1, . . . , ip},
the fermionic (or berezin) integral is the linear functional

i =
i1 < . . . < ip, where i runs over subsets of {1, . . . , n}, and we set |i| := p.

z : v  c,

f () 7z f () d

which picks out the the top degree coecient of f () (a polynomial in the generators)
relative to the generator  = 1 . . . n of det v = nv . this extends to a functional

z : v  v  c,

f (, ) 7z f (, ) dd,

dened relative to the generator  := 11 . . . nn. of det v  det v . given an element

t  end(v ) we associate to the quadratic element t  := pi,j tij ij. we then have

n! (t )n = det(t ), and more generally the gaussian expression

1

where ti denotes the submatrix (tij) with i, j  i, so that we can write

(118)

det(ti )i i ,

et  =xi
z et  dd = det(t ),

determinant bundles and fqft

39

so determinants are expressible as complex fermion gaussian integrals.

next, we have a bilinear form on v  v dened by

(119)

< f, g >=z g(, )f (, ) d[(, ), (, )],

where f () is f () with the order of the generators reversed, and

z f (, ) d[(, ), (, )] :=z f (, )e2 d(, )d(, ),

is the fermionic integral with respect to a gaussian measure. the 2 arises in the exponent

because we are dealing with v  v rather than v . applied to quadratic elements
et  and es dened for t, s  end(v ) we then have





i t

s i

( )

 dd

< et , es > = z es+t +2 dd


= z e
= detv v  i t
s i!
s i! : v  v  v  v and the general formula

= detv (i  st ).

here we use (118) applied to  i t
det a b

c

d! = det(d)det(a  bd1c), valid provided d : v  v is invertible.

we can repeat the process for a pair of complex vector spaces v0 6= v1 of the same
dimension and t  hom(v0, v1) and s  hom(v1, v0). now dene the fermionic integral

just to be the projection onto the form of top degree r : v0  v1  det (v0, v1).
0 , and thenr et = det(t )  det (v0, v1).

associated to t we have et  v0 v1 = hom(v0, v1) we may regard as an element of
v0 v1 via the hermitian isomorphism v0 = v 
here det(t ) is the element det(t )(1 . . . n) = t 1 . . . t n, for a basis i of v0, which is
canonically identied with det(t )  c when v0 = v1, and the gaussian element is then
et = et . the bilinear pairing goes through as before, with < et , es >= detv0 (i  st ),
which gives an alternative formulation of the fock pairing < , >: fwt0
