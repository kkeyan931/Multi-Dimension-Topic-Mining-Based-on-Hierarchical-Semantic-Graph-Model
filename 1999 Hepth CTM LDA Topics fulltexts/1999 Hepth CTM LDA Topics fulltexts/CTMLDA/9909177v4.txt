abstract

we consider the general hypermultiplet low-energy eective action (leea) that
may appear in quantized, four-dimensional, n=2 supersymmetric, gauge theories, e.g.
in the coulomb and higgs branches. our main purpose is a description of the exact
leea of n magnetically charged hypermultiplets. the hypermultiplet leea is given
by the n=2 supersymmetric non-linear sigma-model (nlsm) with a 4n-dimensional
hyper-kahler metric, subject to non-anomalous symmetries. harmonic superspace
(hss) and the nlsm isometries are very useful to constrain the hyper-kahler ge-
ometry of the leea. we use n=2 supersymmetric projections of hss superelds to
n=2 linear (tensor) o(2) and o(4) multiplets in n=2 projective superspace (pss) to
deduce the explicit form of the leea in some particular cases. as the by-product,
a simple new classication of all multi-monopole moduli space metrics having su(2)r
symmetry is proposed in terms of real quartic polynomials of 2n variables, modulo
sp(n) transformations. the 4d hypermultiplet leea for n = 2 can be encoded in
terms of an elliptic curve.

1 introduction

the seminal work of seiberg and witten [1] gave many important insights into the
non-perturbative dynamics of the four-dimensional n=2 supersymmetric su(2) yang-
mills theory whose gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken to its abelian subgroup
(in the so-called coulomb branch). it was subsequently generalized to other simply-
laced gauge groups and n=2 super-qcd as well [2] (see also ref. [3] for a review
or an introduction). seiberg-witten theory deals with the exact low-energy eec-
tive action (leea) in terms of abelian n=2 vector multiplets, which includes both
perturbative (one-loop) and non-perturbative (instanton) corrections. to x those
corrections, n=2 extended supersymmetry plays the important role that amounts
to restricting the n=2 vector gauge leea to the general ansatz governed by a
single holomorphic function f (w a) of the n=2 abelian vector supereld strengths
w a, where a = 1, 2, . . . , nc  1 [4, 5]. this ansatz is manifestly n=2 supersym-
metric, gauge-invariant and model-independent due to the o-shell nature of the
n=2 restricted chiral superelds w a. according to the riemann-hilbert theorem,
a (milti-valued) holomorphic function is fully determined by its singularity structure
and monodromy (or asymptotics). the number of singularities is dictated by witten
index [6]. however, a calculation of the witten index in massless gauge eld theories
is plagued with ambiguities, so that its value is usually postulated from physical con-
siderations and consistency. this is closely related to the existence of bps monopoles
representing the non-perturbative degrees of freedom in the non-abelian n=2 gauge
theory under consideration [3]. indeed, any non-abelian n=2 supersymmetric gauge
eld theory can be considered as a particular yang-mills-higgs system (with adjoint
fermions) whose eld equations admit the solitonic solutions labelled by magnetic
charge, and whose scalar potential is xed by n=2 supersymmetry. the monodromy
behaviour is obtained from perturbative calculations and electric-magnetic (s) duality.
for example, the chiral anomaly of the underlying n=2 gauge theory fully determines
the perturbative (logarithmic) contribution to the second derivative of f (w ), which
is equivalent to knowing the monodromy around the innity in the quantum moduli
space parametrized by vacuum expectation values of the higgs elds. the s dual-
ity and global consistency conditions x the remaining monodromies and, hence, the
whole function f (w ).

due to the holomorphicity of the seiberg-witten leea, the non-perturbative
contributions to f (w ) take the form of an innite sum over all instanton numbers.
in particular, no instanton/anti-instanton (i.e. non-holomorphic) contributions can
appear in the seiberg-witten leea, in contrast to the standard (n=0) qcd. yet

2

another special and very remarkable feature of the seiberg-witten-type solutions is
the fact that any of them (e.g., in the su(nc)-based theory) can be nicely encoded
in terms of the auxiliary (hyperelliptic) curve (or riemann surface) sw of genus
(nc  1) [1, 2]. the function f (w ) is most naturally represented in the parametric
form, in terms of certain abelian dierential sw (of the 3rd kind) integrated over the
periods of sw [3].

n=2 supersymmetric gauge eld theories can have only two types of rigid n=2
supermultiplets, an n=2 vector multiplet comprising the helicities (1, 1
2 , 0), and
a hypermultiplet comprising the helicities ( 1
2 ,0). the two types of n=2 multi-
plets are truly dierent in four spacetime dimensions (4d), but they become dual to
each other in three dimensions (3d). the latter observation can be elevated to the
co-called c-map relating the special kahler geometry of the vector multiplet mod-
uli space to the hyper-kahler geometry of the hypermultiplet moduli space [7] or,
even further, to the mirror symmetry between certain type-ii superstring compact-
ications on calabi-yau manifolds [8]. the leea of the 3d, n=4 supersymmetric
non-abelian gauge eld theories can, therefore, be deduced along the lines of the 4d
seiberg-witten theory [9]. one of the most remarkable developments in the 3d, n=4
seiberg-witten theory was the proposed equivalence between the quantum moduli
space of the 3d, n=4 supersymmetric pure su(n) gauge theory (in the coulomb
branch) and the classical moduli space of n bps monopoles in the 4d, su(2)-based
yang-mills-higgs system [10, 11]. in particular, as was argued by hanany and witten
[11], this equivalence between the moduli spaces of dierent eld theories in dierent
dimensions, for all n, can be understood as a consequence of s-duality applied to
certain congurations of intersecting (dirichlet) 3-branes and 5-branes in type-iib
superstring theory. though the brane technology is very ecient in explaining the
equivalence between the apparently dierent moduli spaces, it is not powerful enough
in deriving explicit metrics on them. in this paper we consider those metrics possess-
ing an su(2)r isometry. another class of the so(2)-invariant hyper-kahler metrics
arises in the quantum moduli spaces of the 3d, n=4 supersymmetric su(2) gauge
theories with k fundamental matter hypermultiplets in the coulomb branch. the lat-
ter can be identied with dk gravitational instantons in four euclidean dimensions.
the dk metrics in (almost) explicit form were recently calculated in ref. [12] from the
standard nahm construction [13], see also refs. [14, 15] for the related work. in the
purely gauge 3d, n=4 theory with nc = 2 the quantum moduli space metric is known
to be given by the su(2)r invariant atiyah-hitchin metric [9, 16]. the asymptotical
metrics in the classical multi-monopole moduli spaces for well-separated monopoles
in 4d are available in their explicit form [17, 18], whereas the exact metrics are only

3

known up to certain algebraic (ercolani-sinha) constraints [19, 20].

a derivation of the exact hypermultiplet leea in four spacetime dimensions (4d)
requires the techniques that are very dierent from the ones used in the seiberg-
witten theory. the main reason is the dierent status of an n=2 scalar multiplet
(called a hypermultiplet) versus an n=2 vector multiplet. to appreciate this fact,
it is worth mentioning the well-known fact that there exist no o-shell, manifestly
n=2 supersymmetric (i.e. model-independent) formulation of the most fundamen-
tal fayet-sohnius (fs) hypermultiplet in the conventional n=2 extended superspace
(see, e.g., ref. [21] for a review of n=2 superelds, and the references therein). some
restricted (non-universal) o-shell versions of a hypermutiplet, nevertheless, exist in
n=2 projective superspace (pss) invented by karlhede, lindstrom and rocek [22],
where they are known as projective [22, 23] or (generalised) tensor n=2 mutliplets
[24]. the pss construction gives up the manifest su(2)r internal symmetry rotating
n=2 supersymmetry charges, while it also implies vector elds amongst the n=2 pro-
jective supereld components. the most symmetric approach to n=2 supersymmetry
is provided by harmonic superspace (hss) invented by galperin, ivanov, kalitzin,
ogievetsky and sokatchev [25], by using the innite number of auxiliary elds. unlike
the pss approach, both n=2 vector multiplets and hypermultiplets can be introduced
in hss on equal footing. moreover, hss allows one to keep both n=2 supersymmetry
and its su(2)r automorphisms manifest. in the pss approach, one adds a holomor-
phic (projective) coordinate to the conventional n=2 superspace, and then one uses
hidden holomorphicity of the n=2 superspace constraints dening the n=2 projective
multiplets. in the hss description, one adds group-valued twistors and uses hidden
grassmann analyticity of the o-shell hss constraints dening n=2 vector multiplets
and hypermultiplets. in our view, as far as n=2 supersymmetry in 4d is concerned,
the grassmann analyticity is more fundamental than holomorphicity. the pss and
hss descriptions of the hypermultiplet leea are closely related, most notably, by
the n=2 supersymmetric projections of hss superelds onto the pss superelds.

the group of analyticity-preserving eld reparametrizations (in hss) is much
larger than the group of holomorphicity-preserving reparametrizations (in pss). ac-
cordingly, a derivation of the exact hypermultiplet leea is more complicated or,
at least, dierent, from solving a seiberg-witten (or riemann-hilbert) problem, just
because more data is needed to x a (grassmann) analytic function versus a holomor-
phic one. a formal solution to the riemann-hilbert problem is given by the linear
system of picard-fuchs dierential equations [26]. as is demonstrated in this paper,
a formal solution to the hypermultiplet leea can be given in hss, in the form of
an analytic hyper-kahler potential of the metric. a derivation of the metric from

4

the hyper-kahler potential requires an elimination of all the auxiliary elds hidden
in analytic hypermultiplet superelds, which amounts to solving the (innite) linear
system of dierential equations on a two-sphere.

from the physical point of view, it is important to understand the origin of a non-
trivial hypermultiplet self-interaction in the leea. for example, as was argued by
seiberg and witten [1], the exact eective nlsm metric for fundamental hypermul-
tiplets with vanishing magnetic charges in the higgs branch of a 4d, n=2 gauge eld
theory is at, i.e. there is no self-interaction at all. however, magnetically charged
(massive) hypermultiplets can have a non-trivial self-interaction [27, 28]. this obser-
vation is consistent with the brane technology [29]. the corresponding leea just
describes the low-energy dynamics of the bps monopoles representing nonperturba-
tive degrees of freedom, in the lorentz-invariant way (cf. ref. [30]). for instance,
the non-trivial nlsm corrections to the perturbative hypermultilet leea found in
refs. [27, 28] (see sect. 3 too) are all proportional to the squared absolute value of
a central charge in n=2 supersymmetry algebra. the central charge itself is given
by a linear combination of abelian charges of the underlying (spontaneously broken)
non-abelian n=2 gauge theory. the non-vanishing central charge is also responsible
for a dynamical generation of the non-trivial scalar potential associated with the hy-
permultiplet leea [28, 31]. those important features were not fully appreciated in
the earlier investigations of quantized 4d, n=2 supersymmetric eld theories, which
were either limited to renormalizable n=2 eld theories or didnt include n=2 central
charges into the propagators (see, however, ref. [5] where the scalar potentials based
on active central charges were investigated in 2d, n=4 nlsm).

the paper is organized as follows. in sect. 2 we review a superspace derivation of
the known relation between n=2 supersymmetry and hyper-kahler geometry in 4d
nlsm, which plays the important role in our investigation. we remind the reader
about the formulation of n=2 nlsm in n=1 superspace and then motivate the use
of pss and hss for a resolution of the hyper-kahler constraints and isometries. in
sect. 3 we discuss in detail the most general 4d leea of a single hypermultiplet, and
demonstrate that it is given by the n=2 nlsm with the taub-nut or atiyah-hitchin
metric. sect. 4 is devoted to a discussion of the leea for many hypermultiplets and
related multi-monopole moduli space metrics. sect. 5 comprises our conclusion. our
presentation is self-contained. basic facts about hyper-kahler geometry are collected
in appendix a. projective superspace (pss) is introduced in appendix b. harmonic
superspace (hss) is dened in appendix c. the classical moduli spaces of solitonic
solutions in the 4d, su(2)-based yang-mills-higgs system are briey reviewed in
appendix d.

2 supersymmetry and hyper-kahler geometry

the most natural description of 4d supersymmetry is provided by superspace. the
natural framework for n=1 supersymmetry is given by n=1 superspace [32]. n=2
extended supersymmetry can be manifestly realized in n=2 superspace that has
three dierent versions (standard, projective and harmonic). as regards general n=2
nlsm, in subsects. 2.1 and 2.2 we rst recall their description in n=1 superspace [33]
and then in n=2 hss [34, 35], in order to remind the reader about the equivalence
between rigid n=2 supersymmetry and hyper-kahler geometry. isometries in general
n=2 nlsm are discussed in subsect. 2.3. the whole section establishes our setup
and provides a technical introduction to the rest of the paper.

2.1 n=2 nlsm in n=1 superspace

n=1 scalar (chiral) multiplets are described by the n=1 complex chiral superelds
i and their conjugates i, i = 1, 2, . . . , k, satisfying the o-shell constraints

{d, d

,

{d, d} = { d 



, d 

} = 0 .

(2.2)

we use the two-component spinor notation that is standard in 4d supersymmetry
[32]. the eld components of the chiral supereld i are

ai = i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) , i

 = d i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) , f i = 1

2 dd i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ,

(2.3)

where | means taking the rst (leading, or -independent) component of a supereld
or an operator. the scalars a and the spinors  are the propagating elds, whereas
the scalars f are the auxiliary elds.

the general 4d nlsm is described by an action

snlsm[a] =

1

22z d4x gij(a)aiaj .

(2.4)

it has an n=1 supersymmetric extension if and only if the nlsm metric gij(a) is
kahler [36]. indeed, the most general n=1 supersymmetric action, in terms of n=1

6

chiral superelds and of the second order in spacetime derivatives of the physical
scalars, reads

s =z d4xd4 k(i, j) =  1

 ajm

k(a, a) ,

(2.6)

and similarly for k(i, j). the right-hand-side of eq. (2.5) has the standard nlsm
form (2.4) with the restricted (=kahler) metric

ds2 = ki

j(a, a)daid aj .

(2.7)

a complex manifold whose metric can be written down in the form (2.7) with a locally
dened potential k is called the kahler manifold [37]. the form of the supereld
nlsm action (2.5) is preserved under arbitrary reparametrizations of i and j.
the line element (2.7) is only preserved under holomorphic reparametrizations of ai
and aj, ai  f i(aj), while this can be extended to holomorphic transformations of
the chiral superelds, i  f i(j). the ricci tensor of a kahler metric reads

ri

j = {ln det(kk

m)},i

,j

.

(2.8)

having constructed the most general n=1 supersymmetric nlsm action (2.5)
in terms of a kahler potential k(, ), one can further impose extra non-manifest
(non-linear) supersymmetry on the action (2.5), in order to get n=2 nlsm. in the
absence of n=2 auxiliary elds, the extended n=2 supersymmetry algebra can be
closed only on-shell, i.e. on the equations of motion for the nlsm elds.

the most general ansatz for the transformation law of extra supersymmetry is

given by

i = d2( i) ,

 i = d2(i) ,

(2.9)

 = d2 =  = 0, and  is
where  is a constant chiral supereld parameter, d 

a function of  and  (modulo an additive chiral term). the on-shell closure of the
supersymmetry transformations (2.9) implies the relations [33]

transformations (2.9) provided that [33]

ji,m =  mj ,

this is to be compared to the eld equations following from the action (2.5),

 k = 0 .

(2.12)

the rst two lines of eq. (2.11) imply that the third line of eq. (2.10) is equivalent
to the equation of motion (2.12), which conrms the on-shell closure of the n=2
supersymmetry algebra [33].

it is now straightforward to check that eqs. (2.10) and (2.11) together amount to
hyper-kahler geometry (appendix a). in particular, the quaternionic structure (a.12)
comprises the canonical complex structure j (3) of eq. (a.6) and two non-canonical
complex structures,

j (1)j

i =

0 j,i
j,i

0  and j (2)j
i =

0

i j,i

ij,i

0  ,

(2.13)

with mixed (one covariant and one contravariant) indices  see the rst line of
eq. (2.10). both j (1) and j (2) are integrable due to the second line of eq. (2.10), while
they are covariantly constant due to the second and third lines of eq. (2.11). finally,
the nlsm metric is hermitian with respect to all three complex structures due to
the rst line of eq. (2.11). according to appendix a, this precisely amounts to the
hyper-kahler structure.

the canonical complex structure, j (3), is obviously related to the given kahler
structure of the n=1 nlsm that we started with. the coordinate system, where the
metric takes the kahler form with respect to a non-canonical complex structure, is,
therefore, related to the preferred one by a nonholomorphic coordinate transforma-
tion.

eq. (2.13) gives the complex structures in terms of the derivatives of the non-
holomorphic functions i and i introduced in eq. (2.9). these functions can be
reconstructed from a given kahler potential and one of the noncanonical complex
structures j [33]. since j anticommutes with the canonical complex structure, the
former can be written down in the form

ji

j =

0 ji
ji

0 

8

(2.14)

with some matrix  and its complex conjugate . it implies that j ij is block-diagonal,

j ij =

ij
0

0

ij  , where

ij  (k 1)i

k

kj .

(2.15)

the covariant constancy of j yields that jk is holomorphic whereas jk is antiholo-
morphic, ijk = ijk = 0. similarly one nds that ij, introduced in the rst line
of eq. (2.11), is antiholomorphic, whereas ij  ki

kkj is holomorphic.

it is straightforward to verify that the functions [33]

obey the desired relation

i  ijkj

i,j = ij ,

(2.16)

(2.17)

while they satisfy all eqs. (2.10) valid for any hyper-kahler manifold. eqs. (2.15) and
(2.16) further imply that

ki i = 0

and i i = 0 .

(2.18)

one concludes that the hyper-kahler structure plays the most fundamental role in
the hyper-kahler geometry, since all other geometrical quantities can be constructed
in terms of it.

the n=1 superspace approach remains the most popular method in 4d supersym-
metry, mainly because it has a very simple and clear connection to the component ap-
proach. however, n=1 superspace is clearly inadequate for n=2 supersymmetry since
only one of the supersymmetries can be manifestly realized there, whereas another
supersymmetry is necessarily hidden, being non-linearly realized. the dierential
constraints implied by the second supersymmetry (see, e.g., eq. (a.13) in appendix
a) are to be solved, since their presence does not allow one to formulate the most
general ansatz for the n=2 hypermultiplet leea or, equivalently, the most general
hyper-kahler nlsm. perhaps, most importantly, any treatment of isometries of n=2
nlsm is very complicated in n=1 superspace [33]. the n=2 nlsm isometries are,
however, going to be crucial for our purposes in the next sections.

it follows from matching the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom that the real

choosing n = 1 in eq. (2.29) results in the on-shell constraints dening the fayet-
sohnius (fs) hypermultiplet (of vanishing central charge) whose independent com-
ponents have helicities ( 1
2 ,0), as is required for the true hypermultiplet [40].
the failure to incorporate the o-shell (i.e. model-independent) fs hypermultiplet
within the framework of the standard n=2 superspace has far reaching consequences
in n=2 supersymmetry. in particular, as regards n=2 nlsm, it does not allow one to
formulate the most general, manifestly n=2 supersymmetric nlsm in the standard
n=2 superspace. since n=2 supersymmetry amounts to the hyper-kahler nlsm
geometry, the roots of the problem can be traced back to the basic properties of the
hyper-kahler structure (appendix a). to the end of this subsection, we argue that
the twistor approach [34, 35] is indeed the natural way to solve this problem.

given a hyper-kahler manifold m, a linear combination, aj (1) + bj (2) + cj (3), of
its three, linearly independent and covariantly constant, complex structures satisfying
the quaternionic algebra (a.12), with arbitrary real parameters (a, b, c), is also the
covariantly constant complex srtructure provided that a2 + b2 + c2 = 1. hence, a
hyper-kahler manifold m possess the variety of non-canonical complex structures
(on the top of the canonical one), worthy of a two-sphere s2. this feature is crucial
for the eciency of the twistor space [41] in monopole physics, whereas its pss and
hss extensions provide the natural framework for an explicit construction of hyper-
kahler metrics from superspace. in the hss approach one extends the ordinary n=2
superspace by the two-sphere s2. because of the isomorphism s2  su(2)/u(1),
one can actually add the group su(2) instead of the coset, by restricting the hss
superelds to the ones that are equivariant with respect to the u(1) symmetry  this
mathematical construction is the very particular realization of a ag manifold [42].
the su(2) symmetry can be identied with the n=2 supersymmetry automorphisms
su(2)r that can be made manifest in hss. in the pss construction [22, 23] one uses
another isomorphism s2  cp (1) by adding a (complex) projective line cp (1) to
the standard n=2 superspace. the su(2)r automorphisms are realized in pss by
the (non-linear) projective transformations. though the hss approach is the most
symmetric and universal one, it also implies the innite number of auxiliary elds,
e.g.
in the o-shell formulation of the fs hypermultiplet. this makes the relation
between the hss superelds and the component approach to be highly non-trivial.
the pss approach can be formulated with a nite number of auxiliary elds for a
restricted class of n=2 nlsm, by assuming a holomorphic (polynomial) dependence

12

upon the cp (1) coordinate. allowing a more general (e.g., meromorphic) dependence
of projective n=2 multiplets upon the cp (1) coordinate makes the pss method to be
essentially equivalent to the hss one [43] (see appendix b for a technical inroduction
into pss, and appendix c for a technical introduction into hss).

the pss construction of the n=2 nlsm metrics can be summarized into a short
prescription known as the generalized legendre transform [44]. one considers sections
of o(2p) line bundles over cp (1), dened by all holomorphic polynomials of the
cp (1) projective coordinate , of order 2p (cf. eq. (b.2)),

q(2p)() = z + v + w22 + . . . + w2p22p2 + (1)p1v2p1 + (1)p z2p ,

(2.32)

subject to the reality condition (cf. eq. (2.30))

q(2p)() = (1)p 2pq(2p)(1/ ) .

one introduces the contour integral (cf. eqs. (b.10) and (b.25))

f =

1

2iic

d 2g(q(), )

(2.33)

(2.34)

in terms of a holomorphic function g(q(), ). a kahler potential k of the hyper-
kahler metric associated with the holomorphic input (g, c) is found by performing
the complex legendre transform with respect to v and v [44] (cf. eq. (b.26)),

k(z, z, u, u) = f (z, z, v, v, wa)  uv  uv ,

subject to

(2.36)

when simultaneously extremizing f with respect to all wa, where a = 2, . . . , 2p  2
(cf. eq. (b.23),

f
wa

= 0 .

(2.37)

the generalized legendre transform provides the very powerful method for an
explicit construction of hyper-kahler metrics, especially after taking into account all
o(2p) sections over cp (1) with p = 1, 2, . . . ,. in fact, one has to take all of them
in the most general case. however, because of the complicated (highly non-linear)
algebraic relations associated with the generalized legendre transform, it seems to be
very dicult to classify all hyper-kahler metrics (e.g., according to their isometries)
by using this method.

13

harmonic superspace (hss) can be independently justied by relaxing (i.e. lift-
ing o-shell) the fayet-sohnius hypermultiplet constraints (2.29) in the on-shell case
of n = 1. it can be achieved with the innite chain,

(2.38)
which involves all complex projective multiplets l(i1i2p+1) up to p = . the hyper-
multiplet hss supereld q+ (see appendix c) is equivalent to eq. (2.38). though it
is denitely possible to incorporate all relaxed projective supermultiplets, including
the one of eq. (2.38), into the framework of the pss construction (appendix b), it is
hardly convenient in practice.

2.3

isometries of n=2 nlsm

as regards the general bosonic nlsm (2.4), its isometry (symmetry) lie group g
may have an isotropy subgroup h consisting of those transformations of g that leave
a point {ai} in the nlsm target space xed. the remaining symmetries of g move
the point {ai}, being non-linearly realised. the innitesimal action of g reads

ai = m ki

m (a) ,

(2.39)

where ki
m (a), m = 1, 2, . . . , dim g, are the killing vectors generating the group g
and satisfying the killing equation k(i;j)
m = 0, while m are (lie algebra) parameters.
the isotropy subgroup h(a) depends upon the point {ai} chosen. in adapted local
coordinates, associated with a given point ai, the group h(a) acts linearly, i.e.

ai = ix(tx)i

jaj ,

(2.40)

where tx are the hermitian generators of h(a). we follow ref. [33] here.

a description of isometries of a kahler manifold has some special features related
to the invariance of its complex structure under holomorphic transformations that do
not mix ai and aj. it is, therefore, natural to distinguish between the holomorphic
isometries possessing the same property, and the isometries that do not. the lie
derivative associated with a holomorphic killing vector leaves both the kahler metric

14

and the complex structure invariant [45]. the action of the holomorphic isotropy
subgroup in adapted coordinates reads

ai = ii

jaj ,

 ai = i ajj

i , where i

j = x(tx)i

j .

(2.41)

the kahler potential is generically invariant under the isometry modulo a kahler

gauge transformation,

k = (a) + ( a) ,

(2.42)

with a holomorphic function (a). in the isotropic case one can always choose the
kahler gauge where  vanishes, so that

k = ii

j(kiaj  k j ai) = 0 .

(2.43)

to describe general holomorphic isometries, one introduces killing vectors ka with

holomorphic components ki

a(a) and their complex conjugates kai( a) [33],

ai = aki

a  lkai ,

 ai = akai  lk ai .

(2.44)

in adapted coordinates, eq. (2.44) takes the form of eq. (2.41). the holomorphic and
antiholomorphic components of the killing vectors generate two separate isometry
algebras, and, in general coordinates, obey the killing equations

k i

jkj

a;k + k j

kkaj

;i = 0 .

(2.45)

eq. (2.45) implies the existence of the killing potential associated with a holomorphic
killing vector [45, 33].

since a hyper-kahler metric is fully characterized by its quaternionic or triholo-
morphic structure, it is also quite natural to distinguish between the triholomorphic
isometries preserving all three complex structures, and the non-triholomorphic isome-
tries that do not share this property. the triholomorphic isometries are also known in
the literature as translational, while they commute with n=2 supersymmetry in the
n=2 nlsm. the non-triholomorphic isometries are sometimes called rotational since
the action of the corresponding killing vector on the complex structures amounts to
their rotation, while they do not commute with n=2 supersymmetry.

in real coordinates (appendix a), a triholomorphic killing vector km satises the

equation

pi

mkm(cid:17);j

= 0 ,

15

(2.46)

where we have used the projection operators of eq. (a.2). eq. (2.46) is equivalent to
the vanishing lie derivative of each complex structure j,

lkji

j  kmji

,m  kj

,mji

m + km

,ijm

j = 0 .

(2.47)

in the special coordinates, where the complex structures have the form (a.6) and
(2.13), and the killing vector km are manifestly holomorphic with respect to the
canonical complex structure, the triholomorphicity condition reads [33]

or, equivalently,

ij kj

;m  jmki

;j = 0 ,

j[ikj

;m] = 0 .

(2.48)

(2.49)

the triholomorphic condition (2.46) or (2.47) can be considered as the integrability
condition for the existence of a real killing potential x (j) for each complex structure
j, which satises the dierential equation [33]

kijij = x (j)

,j

.

(2.50)

in the special coordinates, the existence of a real killing potential x (j) amounts to
the existence of a holomorphic killing potential p and an antiholomorphic killing
potential p , which are dened with respect to j (1)  ij (2), respectively [33].

triholomorphic isometries of a hyper-kahler metric signicantly simplify an ex-
plicit construction of the metric. given an n=2 tensor multiplet amongst the argu-
ments of the pss construction (appendix b) or, equivalently, a section of the line
bundle o(2) in the generalized legendre transform, it always implies a translational
(or triholomorphic) isometry. this can be understood as the result of dualization
of the conserved vector amongst the components of the n=2 tensor multiplet. the
translational isometry is manifest in the corresponding kahler potential of eq. (b.13).
this property is not shared by the higher projective multiplets associated with the
o(2j) bundles over cp (1) with j > 1.

in the hss approach, an analytic hypermultiplet supereld q+ and its analytic

q + naturally form an sp(1) doublet, qa+, where a = 1, 2. the free hyper-
conjugate
multiplet action (c.7) has the manifest sp(1) isometry, in addition to the manifest
su(2)r isometry. the u(1) subgroup of the sp(1) rotations is given by

q+  eiq+ and



q +  ei


q + ,

(2.51)

and it can be identied with the u(1)r symmetry.

16

in order to get the most general n=2 nlsm in hss, lets make the same trick as
in general relativity, where one goes from a at space metric in general coordinates
to the truly curved space metric. in hss we can assign extra sp(n) indices to the
hss superelds,

qa+  qa+ , a = 1, 2, . . . 2n ,

(2.52)

and apply a reparametrization,

qa+  qa+

= f a+(q, u) , with ui

inert ,

(2.53)

to the free hss action (appendix c)

sfree[qa] =

1

2zanalytic

q+
a d++qa+ .

(2.54)

one easily nds that the free action (2.54) gets transformed into

s[qa] =

2zanalyticnf +

a (q, u)d++qa+ + g(+4)(q, u)o

with the particular functions f +

a and g(+4) given by
f b+
qa+

and g(+4) = f +

f +
a = f +
b

b ++f b+ .

(2.56)

it is therefore eq. (2.56), with arbitrary complex functions f +
a (q, u) and a generic
real function g(+4)(q, u), that represents the most general n=2 nlsm in hss (cf.
ref. [46]). the action (2.56) is invariant under innitesimal eld reparametrizations,

qa+ = a+(q, u) ,

u

i = 0 ,

provided that

f +

a = f +

and g(+4) = f +

(2.57)

(2.58)

the hss vielbein fa is the pure gauge eld with respect to the hss reparametriza-
tions, and it can be gauge-xed to the canonical form, f +
a , in adapted coordi-
nates on the nlsm target space. it results in the standard form of the most general
n=2 nlsm action in hss [34, 35],

a = q+

ad++qa+ + k(+4)(q, u)o .
the function k(+4)(q, u) is called a hyper-kahler potential [34, 35].

by analogy with the n=1 superspace description of n=2 nlsm isometries, the an-

(triholomorphic) killing vector xa+ in hss [46].

if the n=2 nlsm action (2.59) in adapted coordinates has a linearly realised

isometry, eq. (2.61) takes the form (cf. eqs. (2.40) and (2.41))

qa+ = ix(tx)a

(subsect. 2.3)




q +, q+; u) ,

l(+4) =

(3.1)
where the hyper-kahler potential k(+4) is an arbitrary function of an unconstrained
analytic hss supereld q+, its analytic conjugate
i . a function
k(+4) should be of u(1) charge (+4) in order to cancel the opposite u(1) charge of
the analytic measure in hss (appendix c). as regards the hypermultiplet leea
also having the form of eq. (3.1), its hyper-kahler potential plays the role similar to


q +, and harmonics u

18

that of the holomorphic seiberg-witten potential f in the abelian n=2 vector leea
[1]. because of manifest n=2 supersymmetry of eq. (3.1) describing the propagating
fayet-sohnius hypermultiplet degrees of freedom only, the equations of motion for
the hss action (3.1) determine (at least, in principle) the component hyper-kahler
nlsm metric in terms of a single hss potential k(+4).
it is not known how to
deduce an explicit nlsm metric from eq. (3.1) in the case of a generic hyperkahler
potential, though some explicit examples are available (appendix c).

a crucial simplication arises when the su(2)r symmetry is not broken, which
is expected to be the case for the hypermultiplet leea (sect. 1). since the su(2)r
transformations are linearly realised in hss, the su(2)r isometry of the hypermulti-
plet leea just means that the corresponding hyper-kahler potential k(+4) should be
independent upon harmonics. this observation gives rise to the most general invari-
ant ansatz for the leea of a single hypermultiplet, in the form of the most general,
of u(1) charge (+4), harmonic-indepenent hyper-kahler potential (cf. ref. [34]),

k(+4) =

with one real () and two complex (, ) parameters. the sp(1) = su(2)pg trans-
formations of q+
a leave the form of eq. (3.2) invariant but not the coecients. since
su(2)pg is the symmetry of a free hypermultiplet action (c.7), it can be used to
reduce the number of coupling constants in the family of hyper-kahler metrics asso-
ciated with the hyper-kahler potential (3.2) from ve to two. in addition, eq. (3.2)
implies the conservation law [34]

d++k(+4) = 0

that is valid on the equations of motion of the hypermultiplet hss supereld,

q + = k(+4)/q+ and d++q+ = k(+4)/

3.1 hypermultiplet leea in the coulomb branch

the manifestly n=2 supersymmetric hss description of the hypermultiplet leea
allows us to exploit the constraints imposed by unbroken n=2 supersymmetry and its
automorphism symmetry in the very ecient and transparent way. for example, as
regards a perturbation theory in 4d, n=2 supersymmetric qed (or in the coulomb
branch of n=2 supersymmetric su(2) yang-mills theory [1]), the unbroken symmetry
is given by

su(2)r, global  u(1)local .

note that  6= 0 only when z 6= 0. the naive non-renormalization theorem forbids
the appearance of the quantum corrections given by integrals over a subspace of
the full n=2 superspace, like the one in eq. (3.6). however, this non-renormalization
theorem does not apply in the case under consideration, because of the non-vanishing
central charge z (cf. ref. [47]).

the infra-red divergence of the one-loop induced eective coupling  in eq. (3.10)
may cause concern about the consistency of our approach. it is worth mentioning,
however, that eq. (3.6) is manifestly n=2 supersymmetric at any . in other words,
the infra-red cuto is consistent with n=2 supersymmetry of the hypermultiplet
leea. we expect the ir divergences to disappear after summing up (ir-divergent)
higher-loop feynman supergraphs with four external fs hypermultiplets (fig. 2).

it seems to be rather dicult to calculate the exact dependence of  upon the fun-
damental parameters of the underlying gauge theory, such as the yang-mills coupling

constant, an n=2 central charge and a higgs expectation value, by using quantum
perturbation theory. the perturbative expansion in terms of feynman graphs assumes
the validity of the weak-coupling description associated with a particular choice of
elds and coupling constants in (a portion of) the quantum moduli space, whereas
the parameter  is essentially non-perturbative (cf. the fermi constant f in qcd).
nevertheless, the exact geometrical (taub-nut) nature of the result (3.6), associated
with a fundamental monopole belonging to the hypermultiplet under consideration, is
very clear in the hss approach. the coecient  is simply related to the taub-nut
mass,  = 1

4m 2 (see appendix c).

to understand the hyper-kahler geometry associated with the hyper-kahler po-
tential (3.6), one may perform an n=2 supersymmetric reduction of the fs hyper-
multiplet to an n=2 tensor multiplet, and then rewrite the corresponding dual hss
action into pss. unlike the o-shell fs hypermultiplet, the o-shell n=2 tensor mul-
tiplet has the nite number of the auxiliary elds  see eq. (2.31). the n=2 tensor
multipet constraints (2.28) can be rewritten to hss as

d++l++ = 0 and


l ++ = l++ ,

(3.11)

where l++ = u+

i u+

j lij(z). lets substitute (we temporarily set  = 1)

tn = 1

q +q+)2 = 2(l++)2 ,

or, equivalently,


q +q+ = 2il++ ,

(3.12)

which is certainly allowed because of eq. (3.3). the constraints (2.28) can be taken
into account o-shell, by using an extra real analytic hss supereld  as the lagrange

q +, q+) to (l++, ) amounts to the n=2
multiplier. changing the variables from (

(3.14)

it is straightforward to rewrite the free (massless) hss action (c.7) in terms of
the new variables. this results in the improved (i.e. n=2 superconformally invariant)
n=2 tensor multiplet action [48],

simproved =

1

2z d (4)du(f ++)2 .

22

(3.15)

the action dual to the nlsm action dened by eq. (c.10) is, therefore, given by a
sum of the non-improved (quadratic) and improved (non-polynomial) hss actions for
the n=2 tensor multiplet [23, 48],

staubnut[l; ] = simproved +

1

2z d (4)duh(l++)2 + d++l++i .

(3.16)

to understand the peculiar structure of the improved action dened by eqs. (3.14)
and (3.15), lets extract a constant vacuum expectation value cij out of lij by
rewriting it to the form

l++(, u) = c++ + l++(, u) .

(3.17)

we use the notation

c = ciju

(cij) = ikjlckl ,

c2 =

cijcij 6= 0 ,

f ++(l, u)  l++f (y) ,

y = l++c .

the function f (y) then appears to be a solution to the quadratic equation,

1

f (y)

= 1 +

yf (y)

4c2

.

(3.18)

(3.19)

it can be shown that this equation follows from the rigid n=2 superconformal invari-
ance on the improved action [48]. the improved action, dened by eqs. (3.15) and
(3.19), does not really depend upon cij because of its su(2)conf. invariance.

it is also straightforward to rewrite eq. (3.16) to n=2 pss and even to n=1
superspace, where it takes the form of eqs. (b.3) and (b.10), respectively. after
restoring the dependence upon   1

in complex -plane. the hyper-kahler metric of the n=2 nlsm dened by eqs. (3.16)
and (3.20) is equivalent to the taub-nut metric after the n=1 superspace legendre
transform (see appendix b) [23], with the mass parameter m = 1
21/2. stated
dierently, eq. (3.6) describes the hyper-kahler potential of the taub-nut metric in
hss (apendix c).

23

the known u(2) = su(2)  u(1) isometry of the taub-nut metric is clearly
consistent with eq. (3.5). it is instructive to investigate the realization of this internal
symmetry in the various formulations of the n=2 taub-nut nlsm mentioned in
this paper. the hyper-kahler potential (3.6) in terms of the fs hypermultiplet q+
provides the manifestly invariant formulation.
in the dual hss form, in terms of
(l++, ), the non-abelian factor su(2) is represented by the su(2)conf., whereas the
abelian factor u(1) is realized by constant shifts of . the su(2)r transformations
act in pss in the form of projective (fractional) transformations (b.7).

eqs. (b.8) and (b.9) imply that the su(2)r invariant pss potential g(q(2))
should be almost linear in q(2), like in the second term of eq. (3.20) where the extra
logarithmic factor is merely responsible for dening the (closed) integration contour.
the transition ui  i = (1, ) describes a holomorphic projection of hss to pss
where the analytic supereld l++(, u) is replaced by a holomorphic (with respect
to ) section q(2)(l, ) of the line bundle o(2) whose ber is parametrized by the
constrained n=1 superelds,  and g. the equation y2 =   ig + 2  denes the

riemann sphere in c2 parametrized by (y, ), where y2  q(2)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12).

3.2 hypermultiplet leea in the higgs branch

there are no instantons in an abelian n=2 supersymmetric quantum eld theory.
this means that the perturbative result of subsect. 3.1 about the hypermultiplet
leea described by the taub-nut metric is, in fact, exact in the abelian case. if,
however, the underlying n=2 gauge eld theory has a non-abelian gauge group whose
rank is larger than one (say, su(3)), one may expect nonperturbative contributions to
the hypermultiplet leea (in the higgs branch) from instantons and anti-instantons,
which break the u(1) symmetry in eq. (3.5) (cf. ref. [11]).

given the most general su(2)r-invariant hyper-kahler potential (3.2), lets make

a substitution [49]

k(+4)(q,
where the real analytic supereld l++++ satises the conservation law (3.3), i.e.

(q+) 3q+ + h.c.# = l++++(, u) , (3.22)

dening together the o(4) projective n=2 supermultiplet (see subsect. 2.2. and
appendix b). unlike the o(2) tensor multiplet, the o(4) multiplet does not have
a conserved vector (or a gauge antisymmetric tensor) amongst its eld components,
which implies the absence of the u(1) triholomorphic isometry in the n=2 nlsm to
be constructed in terms of l++++.

the n=2 supersymmetric pss construction of the invariant actions (appendix
b), in terms of a pss potential g(q(), ), equally applies to the projective o(4)
supermultiplets, while l++++ should enter the universal pss action (b.3) via the
argument

q(4)(z, ) = ijkllijkl(z) ,

i = (1, ) .

(3.26)

the n=1 superspace projections of eqs. (3.26) and (b.3) are given by eqs. (b.24) and
(b.25), respectively, in terms of the n=1 chiral supereld , the n=1 complex linear
supereld w , and the n=1 general (unconstrained) real supereld v .

the auxiliary eld component c of the o(4) projective multiplet, dened by
eq. (2.31) (or, equivalently, the n=1 supereld v in the n=1 superspace reformula-
tion) enters the pss action (b.3) as the lagrange multiplier, whose elimination via
its equation of motion gives rise to an algebraic constraint,

re i

g
q(4)

= 0 .

(3.27)

eq. (3.27) reduces the number of independent physical real scalars from ve to four,
which is consistent with the fact that the real dimension of any hyper-kahler manifold
is a multiple of four (appendix a). after solving the constraint (3.27), the complex
linear n=1 supereld w can be traded for yet another n=1 chiral supereld , by
the use of the n=1 supereld legendre transform. it results in the n=1 superspace
kahler potential k(, , , ) of the n=2 supersymmetric nlsm (appendix b).

the most straightforward procedure of calculating the dependence q(l) out of
the denition (3.22), as well as performing an explicit n=2 supersymmetric duality
transformation of the free fs action (c.7) into the dual (improved) action of the
constrained n=2 supereld lijkl dened by eqs. (3.24) and (3.25), needs the explicit
roots of the quartic polynomial. though it is possible to calculate the roots, the
results are not very illuminating. in fact, the explicit roots are not even necessary to
determine the explicit form of the dual n=2 pss action. within the manifestly n=2

25

supersymmetric approach, it is the su(2)r symmetry and regularity requirements
that are sucient to x the action in question, either in hss or pss (cf. ref. [48]). the
one real and two complex constants, (, , ), respectively, parametrizing the hyper-
kahler potential (3.22) can be naturally united into an su(2) 5-plet cijkl subject to the
reality condition (3.25). after extracting a constant piece out of q+, say, q+
a + q+
a
and ua = (1, ), and collecting all constant pieces on the left-hand-side of eq. (3.22),
we can identify their sum with a constant piece c++++ = cijklu+
l of l++++
on the right-hand-side of eq. (3.22), representing the constant vacuum expectation
values of the n=1 supereld components of l++++,

a = u+

(3.28)

the su(2)r transformations in pss are the projective transformations (b.7), so
that the pss potential g of the improved o(4) projective multiplet action having

the form (b.3) must be proportional toqq(4) just because of the transformation rules
(a + b)4 q(4)() . (3.29)
the most general non-trivial contour cr in complex -plane, whose denition is com-
patible with the projective su(2) symmetry, is the one encircling the roots of the
quartic (cf. eq. (3.21)),

(3.30)

with one real (r) and two complex (p, q) additional parameters belonging to yet an-
other 5-plet of su(2)pg = sp(1). the projective su(2) invariance can be used to re-
duce the number of independent parameters in the corresponding family of the hyper-
kahler metrics from ve to two, which is consistent with the hss predictions. 3 we
didnt attempt to establish an explicit relation between the hss coecients (, , )
and the pss coecients (r, q, p). the most natural contour cr, surrounding roots of
the equation

q(4)() = 0 ,

(3.31)

just leads to the only non-singular hyper-kahler nlsm metric (see subsect. 3.3).

taking together the above considerations implies that the su(2)-invariant pss

action, dual to the hss action dened by eqs. (3.1) and (3.2), is given by

the constraint (3.27) reads in the case as follows:

(3.33)

the generalized legendre transform of the function (3.32) is known [50], so we can
simply borrow some of the results of ref. [50] here.

due to the reality condition (3.25), the quartic equation (3.31) has two pairs of
roots (,1/) related by an sl(2, z) transformation and satisfying the dening
relation

q(4)() = c(  1)(1 + 1)(  2)(2 + 1) .

(3.34)

the branch cuts in complex -plane can be chosen to run from 1 to 1/2 and
from 2 to 1/1. the contour integration in eq. (3.33) can then be reduced to the
complete elliptic integral (in the legendre normal form) over the branch cut [50],

(3.38)

where the euler angles (, , ) have been introduced. together with the modulus
k they represent the independent (supereld) coordinates in the n=2 nlsm under
consideration.

being applied to the function (3.32), the legendre transform (2.35) with respect to
w , on the constraint (2.37) having of the form (3.35), gives rise to the (double cover

27

of) atiyah-hitchin (ah) space m2 as the nlsm target space. it was demonstrated
in ref. [50] by comparing the hyper-kahler structures, which is enough to claim the
equivalence between the n=2 nlsm metrics in accordance with the general discussion
in subsect. 2.1.

the ah space m2 was originally introduced as the (centered) moduli space of two
(fundamental) bps su(2) monopoles [41]. the metric of the ah space is known to
be the only regular hyper-kahler metric with the entirely non-triholomorphic so(3)
symmetry rotating hyper-kahler complex structures [41]. in the donaldson descrip-
tion [51] of the ah space (see subsection 4.2 for basic denitions), the ah space m2
is described by the quotient of an algebraic curve in c3,

x2  zy2 = 1 , where x, y, z  c ,

(3.39)

under z2 :
(x, y, z)  (x,y, z). eq. (3.39) thus describes the su(2)-symmetric
universal (2-fold) covering m2 of the ah space. since our n=2 superspace techniques
are purely local, we are unable to distinguish between m2 and m2. accordingly, we
make no distinction between so(3) and su(2) in our considerations. 4

the line element of any four-dimensional (euclidean) metric having so(3) isom-

etry can be written down in the bianchi ix formalism as follows:

ds2 = f 2(t)dt2 + a2(t)2

1 + b2(t)2

2 + c 2(t)2
3 ,

where f (t) = 1

3 = + 1

2 (sin d  sin  cos d) ,

in terms of the euler angles (, , ). the one-forms (3.41) obey the relations

i  j = 1

2 ijkdk ,

i, j, k = 1, 2, 3 .

(3.40)

(3.41)

(3.42)

the standard parametrization of the ah metric uses the complete elliptic integrals

(3.37) and the modulus k related to the variable t of eq. (3.40) via the relation

t = 

2k(k)
k(k)

,

(3.43)

4see, however, ref. [9] for a discussion of the global issues associated with m2 and m2.

where k is known as the complementary modulus, k2 = 1  k2. the ah metric in
terms of the independent coordinates (k; , , ) reads [41]

ab =  k(k) [e(k)  k(k)] ,
bc =  k(k)he(k)  k2k(k)i ,
ac =  k(k)e(k) .

(3.44)

(3.45)

the parametrization (3.38) leads to the ah metric in the form (3.44) whose coecient
functions (a, b, c) are given by a cyclic permutation of those in eq. (3.45) [50]. the
kahler potential of the ah metric was calculated in ref. [52].

in the limit k  1 (or, equivalently, k  0), one has an asymptotic expansion

k(k)   log k"1 +

(k)2

4 # + . . . ,

(3.46)

(3.47)

which suggests us to make a redenition

k = 1  k2  4 exp  1

! ,

and describe the same limit at   0. after substituting eq. (3.46) into eq. (3.45)
one nds that the ah metric becomes exponentially close to the taub-nut metric
in the form (3.40) subject to the additional relations

a2  b2 

1 +

, c 2

,

(3.48)

and with the negative mass parameter m =  1
2 [41]. in terms of the general hyper-
kahler potential (3.2) whose taub-nut parameter  is xed, we are left with the
one-parameter family of the hyper-kahler metrics, all having the same perturbative
behaviour. in this context, the unique solution given by the ah metric follows from
a calculation of the one-instanton contribution to the leea, which unambigously
determines the last parameter [16] (see subsect. 3.3. for another argument). it also
implies that ||1 is proportional to the one-instanton action.

the extra u(1) symmetry of the taub-nut metric (when compared to the ah
metric) is the direct consequence of the relation a2 = b2 arising in the asymptotic
limit described by eq. (3.48). the vicinity of k  0+ describes the region of the

29

hypermultiplet moduli space where quantum perturbation theory applies, with the
exponentially small (nonholomorphic) ah corrections to the taub-nut metric be-
ing interpreted as the instanton/anti-instanton contributions. those nonperturbative
corrections are supposed to be related to the existence of bps monopoles in the
underlying non-abelian n=2 eld theory. the ah metric, as the metric in the hy-
permultiplet quantum moduli space, was proposed by seiberg and witten [9] in the
context of 3d, n=4 supersymmetric gauge eld theories, where it can be related to
the (seiberg-witten) gauge leea [1] via the c-map in three spacetime dimensions
(sect. 1).

from the n=2 pss viewpoint, the transition from the perturbative hypermultiplet
leea to the nonperturbative one thus corresponds to the transition from the o(2)
holomorphic line bundle associated with the standard n=2 tensor multiplet to the
o(4) holomorphic line bundle associated with the n=2 projective o(4) multiplet.
the two holomorphic bundles are topologically dierent: with respect to the standard
covering of cp (1) by two open ane sets, the o(2) bundle has the transition functions
2, whereas the o(4) bundle has the transition functions 4. in general, the variable
q(2j) is the coordinate in the ber of the o(2j) line bundle.

3.3 atiyah-hitchin metric and elliptic curve

the quadratic dependence of q(2) upon  in eqs. (b.2) and (b.10) allows us to interpret
q(2)() as a holomorphic (of degree 2) section of pss, bered by the superelds (, g)
and topologically equivalent to the riemann sphere described by an algebraic equation

y2 =   ig + 2 with y2  q(2)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12). similarly, the quartic dependence of q(4) upon

 in eqs. (b.2) and (3.26) allows us to interpret q(4)() as a holomorphic (of degree
4) section of pss, bered by the superelds (, w, v ) and topologically equivalent to
the elliptic curve hyper. dened by an algebraic equation

y2() =  + w + 2v  3w + 4 ,

(3.49)

where y2  q(4)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12). the non-perturbative hypermultiplet leea can, therefore, be

encoded in terms of the genus-one riemann surface hyper. [49]. this result is quite
similar to the famous seiberg-witten description [1] of the exact leea in the su(2)
n=2 super-yang-mills theory, in terms of the elliptic curve sw.

the twistor construction of the ah metric [41] is known to be closely related to
the spectral curve h [53]. the elliptic curve h naturally arises in the uniformization
process of the algebraic curve (3.39) in the donaldson description of the ah space
[54]. this actually provides enough evidence to identify h with hyper. [49].

30

the dening equation (3.49) can be put into the normal (hurtubise) form [41]

y2( ) = k 2(k) hkk( 2  1) + (k2  k2) i .

(3.50)

eq. (3.50) is simply related to another standard (weierstrass) form, y2 = 4x3g2xg3
[55]. therefore, in accordance with refs. [41, 55], the real period  of h is

  4k1 , where

4k2

1 = kkk 2(k) ,

whereas the complex period matrix of h is given by

 =

ik(k)
k(k)

.

(3.51)

(3.52)

the normal form (3.50) is related to that of eq. (3.49) by the projective su(2)

2(cid:17) + i. the parametrization (3.55) is closely related to that of

at generic values of the ah modulus k, 0 < k < 1, the roots of the weierstrass
form are all dierent from each other, while they all lie on the real axis, say, at
e3 < e2 < e1 <  = (e4). accordingly, the branch cuts are running from e3 to e2
and from e1 to . the cr integration contour in the pss formulation of the exact

31

hypermultiplet leea in eq. (3.32) can now be interpreted as the contour integral
over the non-contractible -cycle of the elliptic curve h [54], again in very close
analogy to the standard writing of the seiberg-witten solution [1] in terms of the
abelian dierential sw integrated over the periods of sw.

the perturbative (taub-nut) limit k  1 corresponds to the situation when
e2  e1, so that the -cycle of h degenerates. the curve (3.50) then asymptotically
approaches a complex line, y  k . another limit, k  0, leads to a coordinate
bolt-type singularity of the ah metric in the standard parametrization (3.44) [41].
in the context of monopole physics, k  0 corresponds to the coincidence limit of
two centered monopoles. in the context of the hypermultiplet leea, k  0 implies
e2  e3, so that the -cycle of h degenerates, as well as the whole hypermultiplet
action associated with eq. (3.32). the two limits, k  1 and k  0, are related by
the modular transformation exchanging k with k, and -cycle with -cycle [54].

the ah metric is known to be only regular and complete four-dimensional hyper-
kahler metric with the purely rotational so(3) isometry [41, 56, 57]. being regular
means the absence of singularities, while completeness means that every curve of
nite length in the hyper-kahler manifold under consideration has a limiting point.
it is worth mentioning that only regular (i.e. globally well-dened) hyper-kahler
metrics can be interpreted as the metrics governing the hypermultiplet leea. since
the most general four-dimensional su(2)r-invariant hyper-kahler metrics in hss are
given by the two-parametric family described by the hyper-kahler potential (3.2), it
is important to nd a simple way by which one can distinguish the regular ah metric
amongst them. this problem is also present in the generalized legendre transform
construction of hyper-kahler metrics. the underlying elliptic curve provides a nice
interpretation to this problem [49]. the most general integration contour cr in the
pss construction (3.32) is described by eq. (3.30). as is clear from the results of
this subsection, any non-trivial contour cr can be equally interpreted as a linear
conbination, cr = n1 + n2, of the fundamental cycles,  and , of the underlying
elliptic curve sh, with some integral coecients, n1 and n2. an integration over the
-cycle is known to yield a bolt-type singularity [41], and it thus has be excluded.
the contour integration over the -cycle yields the regular ah solution. the value
n1 of the winding number is obvioulsy not relevant for regularity of the metric. 5
a generalization of the regular 1-cycle to the higher-genus spectral curve associated
with the charge-n (centered) monopole space (subsect. 4.2) just leads to the ercolani-
sinha constraints [19] mentioned in the introduction.

5the dk gravitational instanton metrics are not regular [12, 14, 15], and they only possess u (1)

rotational isometry.

4 more hypermultiplets and larger gauge groups

if the underlying n=2 supersymmetric gauge eld theory has a larger (of rank r > 1)
simple gauge group, such as su(n + 1), n > 1, there may be more (magnetically
charged) massive hypermultiplets qa+, a = 1, 2, . . . , 2n, in the leea, either in the
coulomb branch or in the higgs branch. their exact self-interaction is described by
the hyper-kahler nlsm governed by a hyper-kahler potential k(+4)(qa+; u
i ) in hss,

lleea = q+

a d++qa+ + k(+4)(qa+; u

i ) .

(4.1)

the non-anomalous su(2)r symmetry further implies that the hyper-kahler po-
tential k(+4) should be independent upon harmonics. therefore, the analytic function
k(+4) is given by a real quartic polynomial of the analytic hss superelds qa+,

k(+4)(q) = p (+4)(q)  abcdqa+qb+qc+qd+ ,

(4.2)

whose coecients (abcd) are totally symmetric and are subject to the reality con-


p (+4) = p (+4).

in a bit more explicit notation, qa+ = (q+

m ,


q +

m ), we

dition,
have

p (+4)  m n, p qq+
with some constants (m n ),( p q), (n m p q) and (n m p ) q.

not all of the constants are really signicant since the kinetic terms in eq. (4.1)
have the manifest global sp(n) symmetry under the transformations of qa+. hence,
the space of all su(2)r-invariant hyper-kahler metrics in 4n real dimensions is
parametrized by the quotient

tm = {p (+4)()}/sp(n) .

(4.4)

it may not be accidental that the sp(n) factor in eq. (4.4) coincides with the maximal
sp(n) holonomy group of hyper-kahler manifolds in 4n real dimensions.

4.1 exact hypermultiplet leea in the coulomb branch

in the coulomb branch of the n=2 super-yang-mills theory with the g = su(n + 1)
gauge group, the gauge symmetry g is (generically) spontaneously broken to its
maximal cartan subgroup h = u(1)n, due to a non-vanishing vacuum expectation
value, hi 6= 0, of the adjoint higgs eld. since 2[su(n + 1)/u(1)n] = 1[u(1)n] =

33

zn, one expects rank(g) = n dierent types of magnetic monopoles associated to
each of the cartan generators and belonging to hypermultiplets. the corresponding
classical solitonic solutions can be obtained via embedding the known su(2) solutions
(see appendix d) along the simple root directions in g (see ref. [17], or a recent
review [58]). as regards the leea of the hypermultiplets corresponding to dierent
simple roots, it should possess the tri-holomorphic (or translational) u(1)n isometry,
in addition to the rotational su(2)r isometry discussed above. in this subsection, we
present a very simple derivation of the corresponding hyper-kahler potential in hss,
and give the associated hyper-kahler metric in components.

first, lets recall some basic facts about lie algebras and monopoles [59]. the
generators of a rank-r lie algebra 6 can be naturally divided into r commuting cartan
generators {hi}, and the raising and lowering operators, e~ and e~, for each of the
r-component root vectors {~},

mj =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)~h  ~gj(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ,

so that the mass spectrum of the fundamental monopoles (of unit charge) is given by

j = 1, 2, . . . , r .

(4.12)

the long-range force between two dierent monopoles i and j obeys the standard
(inverse radius squared) law, whose strength is given by the inner product of magnetic
charges, ~gi  ~gj/4 [58, 59]. the classical solitonic solutions describing su(n + 1)
monopoles can be constructed, in principle, by the adhmn method [13], whose
(nahm) data is, however, highly constrained. it makes a direct construction of the
multi-monopole moduli space metrics via the so-called moduli space approximation
[30] to be highly non-trivial.

we thus conclude, from the symmetry considerations alone, that the hypermultiplet
leea decomposes into the sum of the single hypermultiplet self-interactions and
their pairwise interactions.

moreover, the equations of motion for the q-superelds, in the presence of any
su(2)r-invariant self-interaction k(+4)(q), imply the conservation laws d++l++

m = l++
m .
for the composite hss superelds (4.14) subject to the reality condition
in other words, l++
m can be recognized as the n=2 tensor multiplets (cf. sect. 3).
this conrms the claim [60] that the exact metric on the moduli space of n distinct
monopoles in a spontaneously broken su(n + 1) pure gauge theory can be obtained
by the generalized legendre transform in terms of sections of the o(2) holomorphic
bundle only. in our terms, this result comes after projecting the hss action (4.15)
into pss by using the n=2 duality transformation (4.14). the equivalent pss action
is given by a sum of the non-improved and improved terms [60],

the generalized legendre transform (appendix b) of the n=2 pss action dened
by eqs. (b.3) and (4.17) yields the n=2 nlsm whose hyper-kahler metric is given

the metric (4.18)(4.21) was rst identied by lee, weinberg and yi (lwy)
[17] as the asymptotic metric in the multi-monopole moduli space for the n distinct
fundamental monopoles corresponding to all dierent simple (or fundamental) roots.

(4.20)

because of its origin, the lwy metric may also be called the multi-dimensional taub-
nut metric. since the inner products of the dual fundamental roots in the case of
su(n + 1) can only be either zero or negative, the hyper-kahler metric (4.18)(4.21)
appears to be regular and geodesically complete [17]. subsequently, it was further
argued by the same authors [17] that the metric found may actually be exact in this
case (see ref. [58] too). as was later demonstrated by chalmers [60], by the use of
the generalized legendre transform based on eq. (4.17), the lwy metric is unique
indeed. our hss approach greatly simplies the proof of this statement.

if one deals with n > 1 similar monopoles (or hypermultiplets) labelled by the
same root (say, ~g1), the multi-dimensional taub-nut metric develops a singularity in
the core region at r = ~g2
1/(4m), where the similar monopoles approach each other
[17]. it means that the asymptotic lwy metric cannot be exact in this case. this
situation is apparently similar to the single charge-2 case described by the ah metric
whose asymptotic behaviour is given by the taub-nut metric with the negative mass
parameter (sect. 3).

the su(2)r invariant family of hyper-kahler potentials in eq. (4.2) describes the
exact metrics on the multi-monopole moduli space if there are no more than two
similar monopoles belonging to the same root, ki  2. in other words, this situation
corresponds to gluing together n atiyah-hitchin or taub-nut metrics, each being
associated with a simple root. 7

a generic real quartic polynomial p (+4)(q) may have no translational isometries
at all. the problem of extracting the explicit hyper-kahler metric associated with
a hyper-kahler potential (4.2) essentially amounts to determination of the set of
composite analytic hss superelds of the second- and forth-order in q+, which would
allow one to make an n=2 supersymmetric reduction from hss to pss, and thus
to get rid of the auxiliary elds. one such variable is obviously given by the hyper-
kahler potential p (+4)(q) itself, because the conservation law (3.3) is valid for any
number of the fs hypermultiplets subject to their equations of motion (3.4). this
gives rise to the o(4) projective multiplet l++++ = p (+4)(q) as one of the good
variables. if p (+4)(q) can be represented as a quadratic polynomial squared, the role
of l++++ is replaced by an n=2 tensor multiplet. one can easily imagine mixed
situations, where dualizing the hss potential p (+4)(q) can be performed by using
both o(2) and o(4) projective n=2 multiplets. some of those mixed pss actions
were considered in ref. [60].

7the case of ki > 2 is discussed in the next subsect. 4.2.

37

4.2 non-abelian leea, rational maps, and spectral curve

it should be emphasized that in the hss-based approach we may easily treat all types
of the gauge symmetry breaking. we only discussed above the maximal symmetry
breaking of the gauge group g down to its cartan subgroup. more general patterns
of the gauge symmetry breaking are possible, with the unbroken subgroup being of
the form k  u(1)rk, where k is a non-abelian (of rank k < r) subgroup of g. it
happens when the vector ~h  h, dening the vacuum expectation value of the higgs
eld in eq. (4.8), is orthogonal to the simple roots of k. the unbroken symmetry
should be simply imposed on the hypermultiplet leea as its isometry. it just forces
the hyper-kahler potential (4.3) to be a function of the k  u(1)rk invariants only,
which considerably restricts the form of the quartic (4.3). in addition, the magnetic
charge ~g is supposed to commute with the unbroken symmetry, which implies [58]

~g  ~i = 0

(4.22)

for all simple roots ~i of k, i = 1, 2, . . . , k.

in the case of massless monopoles and hypermultiplets, some of the diagonal
coecients of the quartic (4.3) become innite.
it does not, however, imply that
the hss description becomes invalid. although it means that some rescalings are
necessary. this is particularly clear in the pss description, in terms of the n=2
tensor multipets, where eq. (4.17) apparently continues to be valid, even if some of
the masses mi vanish.

given the existence of the elliptic curve behind the ah metric associated with
magnetic charge 2, it is not very surprising that there also exist the riemann surface
g of genus g = (n  1) in the case of magnetic charge n (or, equivalently, n similar
fundamental monopoles). the g is known as the spectral curve in the twistor theory
of monopoles [61]. we now briey describe a relation between the pss and hss
constructions of the multi-monopole moduli space metrics and the spectral curve.
the good starting point is the donaldson classication [51] of the charge-n (bps)
monopoles in the su(2) yang-mills-higgs system (appendix d). it is just opposite
to the situation discussed in the preceeding subsect. 4.1, since now all monopoles are
supposed to be similar, being assigned to a single root of g.

the donaldson classication [51] makes use of the rational maps dened by

s(z) =

p(z)
q(z) 

j=0 ajzj

pn1
zn +pn1

j=0 bnjzj

38

(4.23)

in rn(z). it is assumed that the roots j of q(z) are all dierent, while the residues
p(j) 6= 0 for all j. according to ref. [41], there exist a closed 2-form,

 =

nxj=1

dj  d ln p(j) ,

(4.24)

that is symmetric under any exchange of i, symplectic in rn(z), and holomorphic,
being an o(2)-section over cp (1). the donaldson theorem [51] claims the existence
of a one-to-one correspondence between the (universal cover of) charge-n monopole
congurations and the rational maps s(z). for example, the o(2)-section  can be
(locally) written down as

 = (j (2) + ij (3)) + 2j (1)  2(j (2)  ij (3)) ,

(4.25)

where (j (1), j (2), j (3)) is the hyper-kahler structure [41].

it is worth mentioning that the input provided by the rational map (4.23) naively
has 4n real parameters given by the real and imaginary parts of the complex coe-
cients (ai, bj). since the function s(z) transforms as the (chiral) 2d conformal eld
[62] under the transformations

ai  iai ,

bi  ibi ,

(4.26)

with the complex parameter , the map s(z) is actually dependent upon (4n  2)
real parameters. the gauge symmetry (4.26) can be xed, for example, by choosing
a gauge bn1 = 0. the equation

n(p, q) 

nyj=1

p(j) = 1 ,

(4.27)

where n(p, q) is known as the resultant of the map s(z), denes the algebraic man-

ifold fm n of real dimension 4(n 1). the resultant also has a cyclic symmetry under

the transformations

n :

ai  qai , where

qn = 1 .

(4.28)

as is explained in ref. [51], it is the quotient space fm n/n that is supposed to be

identied with the charge-n (centered) monopole moduli space (cf. eq. (3.39) for
the ah space). setting n = 1 and bn1 = 0 means choosing the overall phase and
location of the n-monopole to be zero [10]. it is now easy to verify that the donaldson
description of the ah space in eq. (3.39) follows from eq. (4.27) in the case of n = 2.

in the general case, all {i, p(j)} are the good complex (donaldson) coordinates
on the multi-monopole moduli space, while bj can be recognized as the o(2j) section

39

over cp (1), bj() = q(2j)(), that is real in the sence of eq. (2.33). the (hitchin)
spectral curve g of genus g = n  1 can now be written down in the form

yn +

njq(2j)() = 0 .

(4.29)

nxj=1

the riemann surface (4.29) has the full information about a charge-n monopole.
the equivalent pss data (g, c) in the form of eq. (b.3) and the related hss potential
k(+4) in eq. (2.59) can, therefore, be completely encoded in terms of the spectral
curve (4.29). in particular, the corresponding pss potential was recently found by
houghton [63], and it leads to the n=2 pss nlsm action dictated by

1

2ii g =ic

y

,

(4.30)

where c is a non-trivial 1-cycle on g (see, e.g., ref. [19] for details), and o =pn
j=1 0j
where 0j encircles the origin of the j-th sheet of g. the corresponding hss potential
k(+4)(q, u) is a nite polynomial in q or order 2n, while it must be explicitly dependent
upon harmonics in the case of n > 2. this means that the su(2)r symmetry is
necessarily broken for n > 2. the asymptotical behavior of the multi-monopole
moduli space metric is described by the limit where the spectral curve g degenerates
(with exponential accuracy) into the product of g spheres [63]. it also implies that
q(2j)  qj

(2) that brings us back to the preceeding subsect. 4.1.

since the hss method can be considered as the very particular application of ag
manifolds in the twistor approach to a construction of the hyper-kahler metrics on
the multi-monopole moduli spaces, the hss method may also be useful for a construc-
tion of the classical monopole solutions themselves. for instance, a correspondence
between the su(n + 1) monopoles and the rational maps of the riemann sphere into
ag manifolds was recently noticed in ref. [64], whereas the relevance of harmonic
maps in this connection was recently emphasized in ref. [65]. it would be interesting
to explore their relations to hss.

5 conclusion

in this paper we reviewed many aspects of the hypermultiplet low-energy eective
action, including the pss and hss technology. our results are summarized in the
abstract. we conclude with a few remarks of general nature.

the 4d twistor approach has many similarities with the inverse scattering method
in the theory of (lower dimensional) integrable systems. it its turn, the integrable sys-
tems are known to be closely connected to the hyper-kahler geometry and the theory

40

of riemann surfaces [66]. in our approach to a construction of the 4d hypermultiplet
leea, it was the passage from the n=2 harmonic superspace (hss) to the n=2
projective superspace (pss) that provided the link of harmonic analysis to complex
analysis and thus allowed us to introduce the holomorphic quantities. the latter were
then interpreted in terms of the elliptic curve h. in addition, the uniformization of
the ah algebraic curve (3.39) describing the ah space is known to be closely related
to the continual 3d toda equation [54] that, in its turn, naturally arises in the large
n limit of 2d conformal eld theories [62].

it is also remarkable that the very simple (quartic polynomial) ansatz (4.2) for
the hyper-kahler potential in hss provides the exhaustive description of the highly
non-trivial class of the su(2)r-invariant hyper-kahler metrics that naturally general-
ize the standard (four-dimensional) taub-nut and atiyah-hitchin metrics to higher
dimensions. the related hypermultiplet leea has manifest n=2 supersymmetry
and the su(2)r internal symmetry. in particular, the n=2 nlsm in hss with the
atiyah-hitchin metric has the natural holomorphic projection to n=2 pss, where it
is associated with the holomorphic o(4) line bundle. similar projections exist in the
more general case of n fundamental monopoles.

the non-perturbative (instanton) corrections to the hypermultiplet leea are
dictated by the hidden (in 4d) spectral curve parametrizing the exact solution. since
the seiberg-witten curve sw is known to have the simple geometrical interpretation
in m-theory, where it can be considered as the part of a magnetically charged ve-
brane worldvolume wrapped about sw [67], it is conceivable that the hypermultiplet
spectral curve h may have, perhaps, a similar geometrical interpretation which is
presumably related to (dirichlet) 6-branes in ten-dimensional spacetime [29].

appendix a: abc of hyper-kahler geometry

a full account of complex geometry, including the hyper-kahler one, is available in the
mathematical literature, see e.g., the books [37, 68]. we follow here the presentation
of ref. [33] adapted for physicists.

lets consider a manifold m of real dimension 2k, covered by a system of coordi-
nate neighbourhoods (charts) {xi}. the coordinates in an intersection of two charts
are supposed to be related by smooth and locally invertible transition functions.

(a.1)

the manifold m equipped with an almost complex structure is called an almost

multiplication by i on vectors in every coordinate chart. the projectors

in this case j is called a complex structure, while m is called a complex manifold. the
complex manifold is characterized by holomorphic transition functions. eq. (a.4) is
equivalent to the vanishing torsion on m,

after introducing holomorphic and antiholomorphic coordinates zi and zi in m,
eq. (a.4) or (a.5) allows one to put the complex structure j into the canonical form

42

(a.6)

the existence of a system of complex coordinate charts in which the almost complex
structure has the form (a.6) is equivalent to the integrability condition (a.4) [37].

given a riemannian manifold m with a metric gij and an (almost) complex
j, the invariance of the metric with respect to the complex structure

structure ji
means

ji

kjj

mgkm = gij ,

or, equivalently, jij  gjkji

k = jji

.

(a.7)

the metric satisfying eq. (a.7) is called hermitian.

an (almost) complex manifold equipped with a hermitian metric is called an
(almost) hermitian manifold. the hermitian manifold thus possesses the fundamental
2-form

  jij dxi  dxj .

(a.8)

in the special coordinates (where the complex structure j is of the canonical form),
the fundamental 2-form reads

 = 2igij dzi  dzj

.

(a.9)

an (almost) kahler manifold is the (almost) hermitian manifold with the closed

fundamental form,

d = 0

or, equivalently, j[ij,k] = 0 .

(a.10)

as is clear from eqs. (a.9) and (a.10), the metric of a kahler manifold can be (locally)
expressed in terms of a kahler potential. the conditions (a.5) and (a.10) together
are equivalent to the covariant constancy of the complex structure,

k = 0 .

ijj

(a.11)

an (almost) quaternionic structure is the set of three linearly independent (almost)

complex structures ji

(a.12)

a manifold with the quaternionic structure is called a quaternionic manifold. if a
quaternionic manifold possesses a metric that is hermitian with respect to all three
covariantly constant complex structures, the manifold is called hyper-kahler. in other
words, a hyper-kahler manifold is characterized by three linearly independent com-
plex structures satisfying the quaternionic algebra, while there exists the coordinate
system for any given complex structure where it takes the canonical form (a.6).

43

any hyper-kahler manifold is ricci-at.

in four dimensions the hyper-kahler
condition is, in fact, equivalent to the ricci-atness and kahler conditions together.
imposing the ricci-atness condition on a kahler potential k  see eq. (2.8) 
results in the non-linear partial dierential equation

det(ki

j) = 1

(a.13)

known as the monge-ampere equation [23].

perhaps, the most elegant description of hyper-kahler geometry is possible in
terms of holonomy, whose generators are the components of the riemannian curva-
ture. given a riemannian manifold of real dimension 4n, it is hyper-kahler if and
only if its holonomy is a subgroup of sp(n). the case of n = 1 is special since the
most general 4d holonomy group factorizes, o(4) = su(2)  su(2). self-duality
of the riemann curvature means that the holonomy is a subgroup of su(2). since
su(2) = sp(1), it is clear that a four-dimensional hyper-kahler manifold is always
(anti)self-dual and vice versa [41].

appendix b: n=2 projective superspace (pss)

the idea of n=2 projective superspace (pss) naturally comes out of the eorts to con-
struct an n=2 supersymmetric self-interaction of the projective o(n) multiplets satis-
fying the constraints (2.29) and (2.30) [22, 24]. lets introduce a function g(la; , ),
whose arguments are given by some number (a = 1, 2, . . .) of the o(n) projective mul-
tiplets (of any type with n  2) and two projective (complex) cp (1) coordinates, 
and , and constrain it by four linear dierential equations in n=2 superspace,

g  (d1

 + d2

)g = 0 ,  


g  (d1

 + d2





)g = 0 .

(b.1)

it is straightforward to verify that a general solution to eq. (b.1) reads

g = g(qa(); ) ,

 =  , q(n)()  i1    inli1in ,

i  (1, ) ,

(b.2)

in terms of an arbitrary function g(qa; ). of course, in deriving eq. (b.2) we have
used the dening constraints (2.29).

since the function g does not depend upon a half of the grassmann coordinates
of n=2 superspace by its denition (b.1), its integration over the rest of the n=2
superspace coordinates is invariant under n=2 supersymmetry. this leads to the
following n=2 invariant action [22, 24]:

s[la] =z d4x

1

2iic

d (1 + 2)4f 2e 2g(qa, ) + h.c. ,

44

(b.3)

where we have introduced the new superspace derivatives,

f   d1

  d2
 ,

e 
  d

  d

 ,



(b.4)

in the directions orthogonal to the vanishing directions dened by eq. (b.1). the
integration contour c in the complex -plane is supposed to make the action (b.3)
non-trivial. the points  = i, where the linear independence of the derivatives
(b.1) and (b.4) breaks down, should be outside of the contour c.

the form of the pss action (b.3) is universal in the sense that it applies to
any set of the projecive multiplets l(n) entering the action via the corresponding
function q(n)() dened by eq. (b.2), while the whole action is governed by a single
holomorphic potential g. this construction is easily generalizable to the case of the
so-called relaxed hypermultiplets. for example, in the case of the relaxed howe-stelle-
townsend hypermultiplet dened by the n=2 superspace constraints [69]

d(i

 ljk) = dllijkl , d(i

 ljklm) = 0 ,

and their conjugates, one should merely substitute q(2) by [21]

q(2),rel. = q(2) 

5
4

q(4)



.

(b.5)

(b.6)

some comments are in order. in the odd case of n = 2p + 1, the conjugated super-
elds li1in may enter the action (b.3) via the corresponding polynomial q(2p+1)().
however, this makes the potential g to be nonholomorphic, so that we exclude those
superels from our consideration. the factor (1 + 2)4 in the action (b.3) was intro-
duced to simplify the transformation properties of the integrand under the su(2)r
automorphisms of the n=2 supersymmetry algebra, as well as the corresponding
expressions in n=1 superspace (see below).

it is worth mentioning that the pss construction above is not invariant under the

su(2)r rotations. the cp (1) variable  has the rational transformation law,

 =

a  b
a + b

,

(b.7)

whose complex su(2)r transformation parameters (a, b) are constrained by the con-
dition |a|2 + |b|2 = 1. nevertheless, the n=2 supersymmetric action (b.3) is going to
be su(2)r invariant too, provided that the function g transforms as

g(q, ) =

1

(a + b)2 g(q, )

45

(b.8)

under the projective transformations (b.7), modulo an additive total derivative. since
we have

(b.8) puts the severe restriction on a choice of g. for example, the su(2)r invariant
pss lagrangian of an o(2) multiplet should be linear in q2 outside of the origin of
the complex -plane (in fact, up a logarithmical factor), whereas in the case of an
o(4) multiplet, its su(2)r invariant pss lagrangian should be proportional to q4.
the invariant action (b.3) of n=2 tensor multiplets (n = 2) can be easily rewritten

to n=1 superspace [22]. one nds q(2) =   ig + 2  and

in terms of the n=1 complex chiral supereld  = l11| and the n=1 real linear
supereld g = l12|, where | denotes the (2, 1)-independent part of a supereld or
an operator. the n=1 multiplets  and g together constitute an n=2 tensor multiplet

in 4d. the n=1 superspace covariant derivatives are given by d = d2| and d = d1(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12),

to trade the n=1 linear supereld g for yet another n=1 chiral supereld  (cf.
eq. (b.26) and the discussion below). when being applied to the action (b.10), it
yields the dual nlsm action

(b.18)

the n=1 superspace legendre transform eliminates all the n=1 linear superelds
h a in favor of the n=1 chiral superelds a according to the algebraic equation
(b.15),

whose solution is

a + a = gab(, )h b ,

h a = gab(, )(a + a) ,

in terms of the inverse matrix gab. substituting the solution (b.20) back into
eq. (b.16) yields a kahler potential in n=1 superspace,

k(, , , ) = k(, ) + 1

2gab(, )(a + a)(b + b) .

(b.21)

by construction, the kahler potential (b.21) is parametrized by the holomorphic
potential f (), while it yields a hyper-kahler nlsm metric because of (on-shell) n=2
suspersymmetry. in the context of the c-map (sect. 1), the n=1 chiral superelds 
can be interpreted as the co-vectors associated with the dual special kahler manifold
[70].

it is straightforward to reduce the n=2 pss self-interaction of other projective
multiplets with n > 2 in eq. (b.3) to n=1 superspace. for example, the components
of the projective o(4) supereld lijkl dened by the constraints (2.29) and (2.30) are
given by

that reduces the number of the independent bosonic degrees of freedom on-shell.
indeed, the scalars lijkl comprise ve real bosonic components, while eq. (b.23)
reduces their number by one, in agreement with the known fact that the dimension
of a hyper-kahler manifold is always multiple to four.

the n=1 superspace reformulation of the interacting theory (b.3) in terms of
the projective o(4) multiplet is obtained after a decomposition of the n=2 extended
supereld lijkl in terms of its n=1 supereld constituents,

(b.24)

l1111(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) =  , l2222(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) =  ,

4 l1112(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = w ,

6 l1122(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = v ,

where  is the n=1 complex chiral supereld satisfying the constraints (2.1), w is
the n=1 complex linear supereld, d 
w = 0, and v is the general n=1 real scalar

supereld. it gives rise to the n=1 superspace action [21]

(b.25)

the n=1 complex linear multiplet w is dual to an n=1 chiral multiplet , while it
can be made manifest after introducing the n=1 chiral lagrange multiplier  into
the action (b.25). this yields the master action

s = s1 +z d4xd4 (cid:16)w + jw(cid:17) ,

(b.26)

where w is now the general complex scalar n=1 supereld. varying eq. (b.26) with
respect to  yields back the constraint on w and the action s1. varying eq. (b.26)
with respect to w instead (i.e. performing the legendre transform) yields an algebraic
equation on w , which can (at least, in principle) be solved in terms of the other
superelds. after being substituted back into the action (b.26), it results in the dual
n=1 supersymmetric action

sdual =z d4xd4 k(, , , ; v ) ,

(b.27)

with certain function k. the general supereld v can now be determined from
eq. (b.27), by the use of its algebraic equation of motion. substituting the result
back into eq. (b.27) yields the n=2 nlsm hyper-kahler potential kh.k.(, ; , )
that is only dependent upon the n=1 chiral superelds and their conjugates.

appendix c: n=2 harmonic superspace (hss)

in the hss approach [25] one adds harmonics (or twistors) ui parametrizing the
riemann sphere s2  su(2)/u(1) and satisfying the relations

u+iu

i = 1 ,

u+iu+

i = uiu

i = 0 ,

ui+ = u

(c.1)



u+i

then one can make manifest the hidden analyticity structure of the standard n=2
superspace constraints (subsect. 2.2) dening both n=2 vector multiplets and fayet-
sohnius hypermultipets, and nd their manifestly n=2 supersymmetric solutions
in terms of unconstrained (analytic) n=2 superelds, while preserving the su(2)r
(linearly realized) symmetry. we follow ref. [25] here.

instead of using an explicit parametrization of the sphere s2, it is more convenient
to deal with the (equivariant) functions of the harmonics, which carry a denite u(1)
charge dened by u(u

z du = 1 and

i ) = 1. the simple harmonic integration rules,
z du u+(i1    u+imuj1    ujn) = 0 otherwise ,

(c.2)

are similar to the (berezin) integration rules in superspace. it is obvious that any
harmonic integral over a u(1)-charged quantity vanishes.

the usual complex conjugation does not preserve analyticity (see below). how-
ever, it does, after being combined with another (star) conjugation that only acts on


u
u(1) indices as (u+
i = ui. the
harmonic covariant derivatives preserving the dening equations (c.1) are given by

i ) = u+

ui= u

(c.6)

analytic = ++  2i+ + ,
d++

it preserves analyticity, and it allows one to integrate by parts. in what follows we
omit the explicit reference to the analytic basis, in order to simplify our notation.

it is the advantage of hss that both an o-shell n=2 vector multiplet and an o-
shell hypermultiplet can be introduced there on equal footing. for example, the fayet-
sohnius hypermultiplet is naturally described in hss by an unconstrained complex
analytic supereld q+ of u(1) charge (+1). an n=2 vector multiplet in hss is
described by an unconstrained analytic gauge supereld v ++ of u(1) charge (+2).
the hss supered v ++ is real with respect to the analyticity preserving conjugation,
v ++ 
= v ++, while it can be naturally introduced as a connection to the harmonic
derivative d++ [25].

where we have introduced the notation q+
minimal coupling to an abelian n=2 gauge supereld v ++ reads [25]

a = (


q +, q+), qa+ = abq+

b and a = 1, 2. its

s[q, v ] = z d (4)du


q +(d++ + iv ++)q+ .

(c.8)

both actions are also manifestly invariant under the su(2)r automorphisms, just be-
cause of the absence of explicit dependence of the hss lagrangian upon harmonics.
the action (c.7), in fact, possesses the extra su(2)pg internal symmetry rotating
the doublet q+
a , whereas this symmetry is apparently broken in eq. (c.8) to its u(1)
subgroup. the massless hss action (c.7) is actually invariant under the full n=2
superconformal symmetry isomorphic to su(2, 2|2) that also leaves the analytic sub-
space invariant. the supergroup su(2, 2|2) contains yet another su(2)conf. that can
be identied on-shell with su(2)r.

a hypermultiplet (bps) mass can only come from central charges in n=2 super-
symmetry algebra. the most natural way to introduce central charges (z, z) is to
identify them with spontaneously broken u(1)r generators of dimensional reduction
from six dimensions via the scherk-schwarz mechanism [28]. after being rewritten

8our superelds are all dimensionless, whereas the constant  in front of our actions has dimension

of length. we set  = 1 for notational simplicity.

51

to six dimensions and then compactied down to four dimensions, the harmonic
derivative (c.6) receives an additional connection term in 4d,

d++ = d++ + v++ , where

v++ = i(++) z + i(+ +)z .

(c.9)

the n=2 central charges can, therefore, be equivalently treated as the abelian n=2
vector supereld background with the covariantly constant n=2 gauge supereld
strength hwi = z. the non-vanishing n=2 central charges break the rigid u(1)r
i, of a massless n=2 supersymmetric eld
symmetry, i
theory. this symmetry breaking results in the appearance of anomalous terms in the
n=2 gauge leea [1], and in the hypermultiplet leea as well [28].

the general procedure of getting the component nlsm metric from a selnter-

acting hypermultiplet action in hss has the following steps [34]:

 expand the equations of motion in grassmann variables, and ignore all the

fermionic eld components,

 solve the kinematical dierential equations (on the sphere s2  su(2)/u(1))
for the auxiliary eld components, thus eliminating the innite tower of them
in the harmonic expansion of the hypermultiplet hss superelds,

 substitute the solution back into the original hypermultiplet action in hss, and

integrate over all the anticommuting and harmonic coordinates.

this most straightforward calculation is very dicult in practice. nevertheless, in
was actually done in some special cases of the n=2 nlsm in hss, including the ones
with the four-dimensional taub-nut [34], eguchi-hanson [71] and gibbons-hawking
(multi-centre) [72] metrics.

for example, in the taub-nut case, the corresponding hss hypermultiplet action

reads [34, 28]

staubnut[q] = z d (4)du"q+d++q+ +

(q+)2(q+)2# .

the hss equations of motion for the analytic supereld q+(, u) are given by

+ + +n (xa, u) + ++ + +p (3)(xa, u) .

(c.13)

the kinematical equations of motion in the (x

central charges, are given by [28]

a non-vanishing expectaion value, hi = v, of the higgs eld breaks the gauge
symmetry su(2) down to u(1). the ymh equations of motion are known to admit
the solitonic solutions given by eld congurations of nite energy, with the boundary
condition 2  v2 at the special innity s2 [74]. the (gauge-inequivalent) solitonic
solutions form the nite-dimensional space labelled by integral topological charge n
belonging to the homotopy group 2[su(2)/u(1)] = 2[s2] = 1[u(1)] = z, which is
simply related to the magnetic charge gmagnetic = 4n/e.

the most fundamental classical solution, corresponding to the static (thooft-
polyakov) monopole [74] of unit magnetic charge (n = 1), is usually written down in

where r is the unit radial vector, while the functions u(r) and h(r) are supposed to
satisfy the boundary conditions, u(0) = 1, u() = 0, h(0) = 0 and h() = v, in
order to avoid singularities and have a nite energy. in the so-called bogomolnyi-
prasad-sommerfeld (bps) limit [75], dened by sending   0 while maintaining all
the boundary conditions, one nds

(d.6)

a fundamental (thooft-polyakov) monopole has four collective coordinates, called
moduli. they comprise three translational components, dening a spacial position of
the monopole, and one angular component, describing the monopole orientation with
respect to the unbroken u(1) gauge group and associated with electric charge of the
monopole. the fundamental monopole moduli space is thus given by a non-trivial
bundle m1 = r3  s1, while it must also be hyper-kahler [41]. the only candidate
hyper-kahler metric on m1 is given by the taub-nut metric, just because of its
isometries and regularity.

the bps solitons of higher magnetic charge, n > 1, can be understood (in asymp-
totic regions) as being composed of n fundamental monopoles. in other words, the
multi-monopole states should not be considered as the new states in quantum the-
ory, but they should rather be interpreted as multi-particle states [58]. the multi-
monopole moduli space is also hyper-kahler of real dimension 4n [41]. the spacial
coordinates, describing the center-of-mass of a charge-n monopole conguration, can
always be introduced to factorize the associated r3 factor in the corresponding moduli
space mn. the total charge conservation. associated with the (unbroken) rigid u(1)
rotations, further implies the presence of an s1 factor in mn. 10 the su(2)based
charge-n monopole moduli space mn is, therefore, of the form [41]

(d.7)

10in the case of higher gauge groups of rank r > 1, the total charge may no longer be periodic,

which implies the r1 factor instead of s1 in the decomposition (d.7) [17].

mn = r3  s1  fm n/n ,

55

where fm n/n is called the centered (or reduced) multi-monopole moduli space of real
dimension 4(n  1), while n stands for a discrete subgroup of its isometry group.
the n-cover fm n of the centered moduli space is a hyper-kahler manifold too. its

modding by n in eq. (d.7) is necessary to get the right spectrum of quantized charges
[41].

complete. in the case of a charge-2 monopole (or, equivalently, two identical funda-
mental monopoles), the centered moduli space is of real dimension four, while it has

a hyper-kahler metric on the manifold fm n is also supposed to be regular and
a rotational isometry so(3). the fm 2 can thus be identied with the ah manifold.
