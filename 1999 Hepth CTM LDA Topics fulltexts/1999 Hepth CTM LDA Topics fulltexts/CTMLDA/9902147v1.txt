introduction

in regge theory the high-energy asymptotics of the hadron-hadron scattering amplitudes is
determined by singularities of partial waves in the complex angular momentum plane. it was
observed [1] that the regularity of quantum mechanics, which relates high-energy scattering
amplitudes to the singularities of the partial waves in the complex angular momentum plane is
valid for quantum eld theory as well. namely, in regge kinematics

is governed by singularities of the partial waves f (j, t), by regge poles and regge cuts. among
the regge singularities there is one with vacuum quantum numbers, the so-called pomeron,
which provides the dominant contribution to the scattering amplitude. the bootstrap conjecture
has been proposed, according to which all particle-like excitations correspond to some regge
singularity and are related to each other via unitarity of the s-matrix and sum rules.

however the programme of building the axiomatic quantum eld theory from assumptions of
only unitarity and analyticity of the s-matrix failed, because regge theory itself does not allow
to calculate the positions of these singularities. now, qcd as a theory of strong interaction is
called to describe the regge behavior of the scattering amplitudes [2]. v.n. gribov proposed
the conjecture, that reggeons form new collective excitations and qcd in the high-energy limit
can be replaced by an eective reggeon theory [3]. this has been conrmed in series of works,
initiated by l.n.lipatov [4]. it was shown that in leading logarithmic approximation (lla),
which is the natural approximation in the regge limit of qcd, a(s, t) can be expressed as a
sum of feynman diagrams describing the multiple exchange of reggeized gluons in the t-channel.
the perturbative expressions for corresponding feynman diagrams including large logarithmic
factors nlogms (m=n,n-1,...) have to be resummed to all orders in s, because bare gluons
and quarks are not a good approximation in the regge limit. the leading contribution (m = n)
comes from ladder diagrams, corresponding to exchange of n-reggeons in t-channel. being built
from an innite number of perturbative gluons, the reggeons carry the quantum numbers of the
gluon and become a new collective excitation in the regge limit (1.1). it is well known that
the leading logarithmic approximation results in an asymptotics, which violates the froissart
bound. unitarity is restored by taking into account sub-leading contributions as well. in the
generalised leading logarithmic approximation (glla) some minimal set of non-leading terms
is included to restore unitarity [7]. the interaction of the reggeons is determined by lla.

in lla the dominant contribution to the partonic scattering amplitude comes from the
it can be shown that infrared

soft gluons and this leads to the gluon reggezation property.
divergences are cancelled for colourless external states due gauge invariance.

of course the distribution of partons inside the hadron are described by the nonperturbative
wave function of the hadron. the non-perturbative eects can be taken into account in the
approach of constructing the high-energy eective action [5]. however, the perturbative inves-
tigation of high-energy qcd makes sense as a rst approximation to begin with. in particular
results obtained in the bfkl pomeron approximation are in a good agreement with experimen-
tal data of semi-hard processes and especially of deep-inelastic scattering at small x. then, some
information about non-perturbative corrections can be extracted from analyzing the behaviour
of the perturbative series in the infrared region [6].

2 high-energy qcd as an integrable model

as mentioned above, the high-energy asymptotics of the scattering amplitude in leading loga-
rithmic approximation is determined by the contribution of diagrams, describing two reggeon
exchange in the t-channel. it is a result of summing up an innite number of the famous ladder
diagrams [4] and corresponds to the exchange of the pomeron. contributions of diagrams with
three (odderon) and more reggeized gluons can be considered as higher corrections. pomeron
contribution corresponds to elastical scattering. diagrams with odderon exchange describe
processes with the exchange of negative charge parity.

the dominating contribution in lla comes from the multi-regge kinematics:

i = 1, ..n + 1,

k0 = pa,

s = (pa + pb)2  2pa  pb
si = (ki + ki+1)2  2ki  ki1
ki = qi+1  qi,
kn+1 = pb

where k is dened by the sudakov decomposition

k =

k  pa
pa  pb

p
b +

kb

pa  pb

p
a + k



owing to this decomposition the scattering amplitudes in the regge limit exibit the remarkable
separation of the longitudinal and transverse directions with respect to the plane, spanned by
the momenta of the initial particles.

in the generalized leading logarithmic approximation the interaction between reggeons is
elastic and pairwise. we shall restrict ourselves to the case where the number of reggeons in
the t-channel n is conserved. for a given n the reggeon green function f{ik} satises the
bethe-salpeter-like equation [7]

f{ik} = f (0)

{ik} + xi<j

h(i,j)

{ik},{jk}f{jk}

(4)

the set {ik} = (i1, ..ir) labels the reggeons, i = g stands for gluon and i = f or i = f
stand for reggeized quarks of corresponding helicity. the partial wave f carries also an index
i, labelling the gauge group representation of the corresponding reggeons and depends in their
transverse momentum ki or their impact parameter xi.

the r-reggeon contribution to the partial wave is obtained by contracting the r-reggeon
green function with the parton distribution functions of the scattered particles. the angular
momentum is

j = 1 +  

rf
2

(5)

where rf is the number of exchanged fermions. the pairwise interaction of the reggeons is
described by the hamiltonian

h(i,j)fi1,..i,..ir =

idk

j(ki + kj  k

j  k

j)[(ti  tj)hhi,jfi1,..i,..j,..ir +

(6)

(ti  tj)ggi,jfi1,..i,..j,..ir]

the rst term in the square bracket corresponds to the interaction via an s-channel gluon:

(ti  tj)h{k ,k } =

r

yk6=i,j

k,k(t a)ii(t a)j j

and the second one corresponds to the interaction via an s-channel fermion

(ti  tj)g{k ,k } =

r

yk6=i,j

k,k(t i)i(t j )j

(7)

(8)

with the sum over the fermion colour states . the overall group state in the t-channel has to
be the gauge singlet.

while the longitudinal part of the scattering amplitude is extracted as a kinematical factor,
the transverse dynamical part can be described by simple feynmann rules, corresponding to
the multi-regge eective action [5]. these graphical rules allow the simple derivation of the
interaction kernels, entering the equation (6). as operators in impact space these kernels take
the following form

h

hgg = hg + h

and (1) =  is the euler number. p12 represents the operator permuting the reggeons 1 and
2.

l.n.lipatov [8] applied the quantum inverse scattering method to solve equations for wave
functions of compound states of n reggeized gluons. the eigenvalue problem related to the
operators (10) arises, because the position of the singularities in  of the t-channel partial wave
f{ik} is determined by their eigenvalues.

lipatov proposed to diagonalize the n reggeon problem by establishing the correspondence
between the operators (10) and the xxx heisenberg model. he has noticed that the operator
hg has two equivalent representations:

hg = 1

1

log x121 + 1

2
x12 log 12x1

log x122 + log 12  2(1) =
12 + 2 log x12  2(1)

and therefore the transposed operator can be represented in two ways as follows:

(hg)t = 1 log x121

1 + 2 log x121

2 + log 12  2(1) = 12hg(12)1.

on the other hand we have

(hg)t = x12 log 12x1

12 + 2 log x12  2(1) = x2

12 hgx2
12

then we can deduce

[hg; c00] = 0,

c00 = x2

1212

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

this equation expresses the fact of conformal invariance of hg. indeed, this operator coincides
with casimir operator of sl(2) of zero conformal weights c00. then it is reasonable to denote
hg as h 00.

(h123)t = 123h123(123)1 = (x12x23x31)1h123x12x23x31,

i.e. it commutes with the operator a3:

[hg; a3] = 0,

a3 = x12x23x31123

(15)

(16)

(17)

notice, that operator a3 is the commutator of partial casimir operators of the chain links:

a3 = [c00

12 , c00

31 ] = [c00

23 , c00

12 ] = [c00

31 , c00

(18)

therefore eq. (17) is a consequence of (18) and the jacobi identity. it is easy to check, that the
n -reggeon hamiltonian

commutes with

hn =

xi=1

hi,i+1,

it can be checked also, that hn commutes with cn ,

cn = x1i<jn

the eigenvalue problem:

(19)

(20)

(21)

a(x1, x2, x3) = a(x1, x2, x3),

c(x1, x2, x3) = (1  )(x1, x2, x3),

(22)

can be considered instead of the original eigenvalue problem:

h123(x1, x2, x3) = e123(x1, x2, x3),

(23)

which looks much more complicated.

the equation (21) expresses the conformal invariance of the n reggeon system and suggests
the connection with the isotropic sl(2) heisenberg model with n cites and cyclic boundary
conditions, because cn can be identied with casimir operator of this symmetry algebra.

lipatov has related to each !site of the heisenberg chain the following lax operator

li = (cid:18)  + s0

(24)

(25)

(26)

and  is the spectral parameter. the lax operator (21) satises the yang-baxter equation.
therefore the trace of the monodromy matrix

t () =

n

yi=1

li()

is the generating function for the set of n mutually commuting dierential operators qk:

qk = xi1<i2<...<ik

xi1i2xi2i3...xiki1i1i2...ik

(27)

(28)

now it is plausible enough that all operators qk commute with the hamiltonian and the latter
can be represented as a function of qk. explicite calculations for low n cases and additional
mathematical arguments [9] corm this. moreover, the relation between the high-energy qcd
kernels and the xxx heisenberg spin chains turns out to be much deeper. namely, this
connection can be extended to the case where fermions are incorporated. the ideas of conformal
symmetry in regge asymptotics [10] have been developed in application to the fermion exchange
in [11].

3 review of integrable chains

let us review the main facts of the theory of integrable systems, concerning the xxx heisenberg
magnet. in our review we shall follow sklyanins work [12]. the phenomenon of the integrability
of quantum systems can be understood by means of their relation to the linear ones via separation
of variables. namely, the quantum system is integrable, if its non-linear equations of motion can
be represented as the zero-curvature conditions of some integrable linear system [13]. physically
this means, that the interaction of such systems reduces to the elastic scattering and the only
result of it consists in the exchange of quantum numbers (momenta etc.) of the scattered
particles. accordingly, the s-matrix of the theory is factorized into the product of blocks,
corresponding to 2  2 scattering and also 1  1 in the presence of a boundary [14].

a set of (annihilation) operators za() satisfying the zamolodchikov algebra: has been

proposed for an algebraic description of the factorizable scattering.

za()zb() = sab,cd(  )zd()zc()

(29)

where s is n2  n2 matrix. the consistency condition of this system, which follows from the
associativity property of the triple product za1(1)za2(2)za3 (3), that is the yang-baxter
equation for the s-matrix:

saj ak (j  k)saj al(j  l)sakal(k  l) =
sakal(k  l)saj al(j  l)saj ak (j  k).

(30)

extending this algebra by adding n conjugated (creation) operators z 
chikov - faddeev algebra:

a(), one gets the zamolod-

za()z 

b () = ab(  ) + z 

c () sac,bd(  )zd(),

or in matrix notations:

a()  a()  a1()a2() = s12(  )a2()a1(),
2()a
21(  ),
2() s12(  )a2(),

2() = a
1() = i1(  ) + a

(32)

where a() and a() are the column (z1(), ..., zn())t and the row (z 
n() corre-
spondingly, subscripts refer to the corresponding isotopic spaces cn  cn  v1v2 and s21 =
ps12p, s12 = ps12, p is the permutation operator in cn cn. the complete scattering matrix
s({k}) of the m particle is factorized then into the ordered product of m (m 1)/2 two-particle
s-matrices (29). for example the s-matrix of the j-th particle on the other m  1 particles is
given by t(j; {m}), i.e. the particular value of the transfer matrix for  = j:

1(), ..., z 

t(; {m}) = trat (; {m})  trayk

sak(  k),

(33)

the trace in this expression is taken over the auxiliary space va, while the transfer matrix
acts in the quantum space m
k=1vk. in the framework of the quantum inverse scattering method
(qism) [16, 12] instead of the original non-linear problem the auxiliary linear one is considered:

or

in discrete case.

d
dx

t (, x) = l(, x)t (, x)

(34)

t (n + 1, ) = ln+1()t (n, )

this is the lax operator of the qism [17]. the solution of (34):

t (, x) = p exp(z x

l(, y)dy),

t (n, ) = ln()ln1()...l1()

(35)

in discrete case, denes the monodromy matrix t ().

its entries are the new variables (the quantum scattering data), which commutation relations

are dened by

n

ri1i2,j1j2(  )tj1k1()tj2k2() =

(36)

ti2j2()ti1j1()rj1j2,k1k2(  ).

we see that integrable systems are specied by the r-matrix, which acts on cn cn and satises
the yang-baxter equation

n

ri1i2,j1j2()rj1i3,k1j3( + )rj2j3,k2k3() =

n

xj1,j2,j3=1
xj1,j2,j3=1

n

ri2i3,j2j3()ri1j3,j1k3( + )rj1j2,k1k2().

in general the r-matrix depends on the spectral parameter  and other parametres. although
there is no complete mathematical theory of the yang-baxter equation, a variety of solutions
are! known as well as dierent elds of their application. they are classied by the lie algebra,
its irreducible representations, and the spectral parameter dependence: rational, trigonometric
and elliptic ones [15]. given a solution r() one can dene the quadratic algebra tr of n  n
matrix elements tij, which is generated by eq. (36). the associative algebra tr realizes the
representation space of a quantum integrable system. the commutative integrals of motion are
t() = trt (), which follows from (36), taking the trace of t1t2 = r1
12 t2t1r12. the algebra
tr posesses the comultiplication property: if t1() and t2() are two representations of tr in
the quantum spaces v1 and v2, then the matrix

tik() = t1,ij()t2,jk()

(38)

is a representation of tr in the tensor product v1  v2. this property allows to represent t ()
as a product of elementary representations, the so called lax operators li(). it follows from
sl(2) symmetry of the r-matrix that an arbitrary constant dd matrix k provides the simplest
representation of the algebra tr. this algebra has a central element, the quantum determinant
of t ():

()  detqt () = d( + /2)a(  /2)  b(  /2)c( + /2 =
a(  /2)d( + /2)  c(  /2)c( + /2) =

a( + /2)d(  /2)  b( + /2)c(  /2) =

d( + /2)a(  /2)  c( + /2)b(  /2) =

which has the following remarkable properties

detqt1()t2() = detqt1()detqt2()

and

detqk = det k.

(39)

(40)

(41)

the next representation is given by lax operator, mentioned above, which takes the especially
simple form for the xxx spin chain:

l() =  + 

3

x=1

s = (cid:18)  + s0

s+

s
  s0(cid:19)

(42)

where operators s belonging to some irreducible representaion of sl(2) have commutation
relation (22). note that the r-matrix itself can be choosen as a lax operator, if the auxiliary
space is two-dimensional. we have

detql() = 2  2(c + 1/4), c = (s0)2 

(s+s + ss+).

(43)

1
2

since the l()-operator, being the elementary representation of tr, satises the yang-baxter
relation and the r-matrix depends only on the dierence of the spectral parameters, the shift
l()  l(  ) denes an automorphysm in tr:

r(  1 + s

1 ) (  2 + s

2 ) = (  2 + s

2 )(  1 + s

1 )r

(44)

separating the terms, linear in  in this equation one deduces that the r-matrix is sl(2)-
invariant

[r; s

1 + s

2 ] = 0

(45)

and depends only on dierence 12 = 1  2. the sl(2)-invariance implies that the r-matrix
has to have the form

where pj are the projectors corresponding to the decomposition of the tensor product of two
initial representations into the sum of irreducible representations labelled by spin j.

r = x j(12)pj,

(46)

furthermore the part of eq.(44), which contains no  gives for j(12) the recurrence relation:

j+1(12) =

12 + (j + 1)
12  (j + 1)

j(12),

(47)

which determines r up to a scalar factor.

particular solutions of the y-b equation have properties, which are important for dierent

applications, but which are not necessarily valid for a given solution:
regularity

p-symmetry

t-symmetry

unitarity

crossing symmetry

quasiclassical property

r(0) = (0)1/2p12

pr12()p  r21() = r12()

rt1t2

12 () = r12()

r12() = r21() = ()i

r12() = v(1)rt2

12(  )v 1
(1)

r(, ) = i + r() + o(2),

here the superscript t denotes matrix transposition, r() is the classical r-matrix, () is an
even scalar function,  is the crossing parameter and v determines the crossing matrix m 
v tv = m t. the quasiclassical property gives rise to the direct connection of the quantum model
to the corresponding classical one. many r-matrices have only the combined p t -symmetry:
rt

12() = r21(). the regularity is used to extract from t() the local integrals of motion.

thus the general solution of (44) is given by

t (, ~) = kln (  n )...l2(  2)l1(  1) = (cid:18) a() b()

c() d()(cid:19) .

(48)

because any permutation of the multipliers gives the equivalent result in the algebra tr. notice,
that the l-operator is noting else than a r-matrix, acting in auxiliary and quantum spaces
c2  vi: li()  rai().

the corresponding quantum determinant is

() = detqt () = det k

n

((  i)2  2(ci + 1/4))

yi=1

(49)

now, it follows from

r12(  )t (1)(, ~)t (2)(, ~) = t (2)(, ~)t (1)(, ~)r12(  )

that

[t(, ~); t(, ~)] = 0,

(50)

(51)

where t(, ~) = trt (, ~), the trace is taken over the auxiliary space.

among the integrals of motion (51) we look for local ones, i.e. quantities h (k) k = 1, 2, 3, ..,

which can be expressed as the sum of local operators,

h (k) =

n

xi=1

h (k)

i,i1,...,ik+1

(52)

the periodicity, n + 1  1, is supposed. the local densities h (k)
i,i1,...,ik+1 should involve only
k adjancent spins si, si+1, ..., sik+1. an important case when such local integrals exist is that
of the homogeneous spin chain, corresponding to equal spins i =  and zero shifts ~ = 0. it
has the important property of translational invariance. the corresponding r-matrix is regular.
the similarity transformation

u s

i u 1 = s

i+1,

u sn u 1 = k1s1k1
1 ,

(53)

where k permutes the boundary matrix k and with the lax operator l1: kl1() = k1l()kk.
this transformation generalizes the ordinary translation for the periodic chain (k = 1) to the
twisted periodic boundary condition, specied by the matrix k and u n 6= 1 in contrast to the
case k = 1, when operator u takes the especially simple form: u = p12p23...pn 1n . the
unitarity of u allows to represent it in exponential form

u = eip ,

(54)

where operator p has the physical meaning of the total momentum of the chain. the hamiltonian
of the model then acquires the form

h =

d
d

t()|=0 =

n

xi=1

d
d

pi,i+1ri,i+1()|=0.

(55)

faddeev and korchemsky have shown [9] that the n -reggeon hamiltonian (15), correspond-
ing to the homogeneous chain can be obtained in this manner. unfortunately, the r-matrix,
corresponding to the inhomogeneous chain (see below) posesses no regularity property and the
corresponding hamiltonian cannot be related to the derivative of the transfer-matrix in a simple
way.

the analysis of the integrable systems is modied upon imposing boundary conditions dif-
ferent from the periodic ones. this case is related to the factorizable scattering of particles with
internal degrees of freedom on a half-line [18]. the algebraic description involves additionally a
boundary operator b into the zf-algebra [19]:

za()b = kab()zb()b

(56)

then the two particles factorizability gives rise the reection equation (compare (29):

s12(  )k1()s21( + )k2() = k2()s12( + )k1()s21(  )

(57)

in addition to the yang-baxter equation (30). the reection matrix has the same properties as
the r-matrix, regularity: k(0) = i; unitarity: k()k() = i, t-symmetry: k t() = k();
the crossing symmetry is more elaborated and it involves the s-matrix as well [19].

then the boundary operator b can be constructed by

from the combination,

b = exp(z ()d)

() = za()kab()zb(),

(58)

(59)

which is a local eld ():
[(); ()] = 0. due to the sl(2)-symmetry of the s-matrix,
the corresponding k-matrix can be transformed k  k  = gkg1 with arbitrary g and the
general solution of the reection equation (57) for the rational case, which we are interested in,
is

k() = i + e,

e2 = i.

(60)

the reection equation has an important covariance property:
if t () and k() satisfy the
relations (37) and (57) then k () = t ()k()t ()1 is also a solution of (80), provided
the entries of k() and t () commute, [kab(), tcd()] = 0. the proof follows easily by the
substitution of k () into (80) and by using the fundamental y.b. relation in the dierent form

t 1
(2) ()r12( + )t(1)() = t 1

(1) ()r12( + )t(2)().

if the matrix t () is constructed as an ordered product of n independent lax operators,
then k () can be interpreted as the monodromy matrix of n site lattice model with a boundary
interaction described by the operator valued entries of the matrix k(). it is called sklyanins
monodromy matrix. the corresponding transfer matrix is dened as the trace

t() = tr k()t ()k()t 1(),

where the matrix k() is any solution of (57), corresponding to the other boundary, is commu-
tative [12]

[t(), t()] = 0.

in the context of the heisenberg chain equation (57) takes the form:

r12(  )k

12 ( + )k

(61)

(62)

in practice, if k () is a solution of (61) then
where m is crossing matrix, dened above.
k +() = (k (  ))tm is a solution of (62). the eq. (57) has an important covariance prop-
erty: if t (, ~) and k() satises the relations (37) and (61), (62) then sklyanins monodromy
matrix:

(63)
where t (, ~) = rn a(  n )...r2a(  2)r1a(  1), (cr. with (58)), satises the relation

u (, ~) = t (, ~)k () t (, ~),

r12(  )u(1)(, ~)rt1t2

12 ( + )u(2)(, ~) = u(2)(, ~)r12( + )u(1)(, ~)rt1t2

12 (  ). (64)

indeed, we note that unitarity and crossing symmetry together imply the relation

m(1)rt2

12(  )m 1

(1) rt2

12(  ) = ().

(65)

futhermore, we see that unitarity implies t (, ~) t (, ~) = q (  i). therefore, up to a
scalar factor, t (, ~) is the inverse of t (, ~)..

the commutativity of the transfer matrix t(, ~) implies integrability of the open quantum

spin chain with the hamiltonian [12]:

h =

4 closed xxx heisenberg chain

(66)

(67)

there are two ways of including fermions. the rst corresponds to considering closed heisenberg
chains with dierent spins, i.e. contain the operators gf g and hf together with hg. this
case arises in amplitudes with the exchange of two adjoint fermions and one gluon. the same
hamiltonian also describes the exchange of three fermions in the fundamental representation of
su (3) if not all three have the same helicity. in the rst case the regge singularity is near j = 0
and in the second near j = 1/2. the seconds way of including fermions will be considered in
the next section.

we consider the conformally covariant operator obtained from h 

f by substituting  = 0,

h 0 1

2 = 1

1

log x121 + log x12 + log 12  2(1) = x12 log 1x1

12 + log 2 + 2 log x12  2(1) (68)

with 1 = 0, 2 = 1/2 and the conjugated operator

h

1

2 0 = 1

2

log x122 + log x12 + log 12  2(1) = x12 log 2x1

12 + log 1 + 2 log x12  2(1) (69)

with 1 = 1/2, 2 = 0. we have also hf which should be denoted by

1

2

h

1

2 = 2 log x12 + log 12 = x1

12 h 00x12

with the weights 1 = 2 = 1

2 . we have used the identity

(x122)1 = 1

log x122  log x12

the operator h

2 is selfconjugated.

1 + log x12 + log 12  2(1) = 1h 0 1
12 h 0 1

therefore,

taking into account that

[h 0 1

(p12x121)2 = p12x121p12x121 = x212x121 = c0 1

the corresponding hamiltonian commutes with the casimir operator

(87)

the same happens for the longer closed chains. the hamiltonians for that chains commute
only with the rst current, the casimir operator. this means that in order to describe the
integrable model, the corresponding hamiltonian should be modied. indeed, the inhomogeneous
chains (g. 3,4) have to be considered as the chains with impurity. probably, the expression for
h 0 1

2 has to be changed slightly.

5 xxx heisenberg chain with open boundary

the second way of including fermions is to build an open chain with the fermions (now in the
fundamental gauge group representation) at the ends. this open chain corresponds to the regge
exchange with meson quantum numbers in the t-channel.

let us consider the hamiltonian

sponding to the following chain

then h commutes with

2 00
123 = p123x32x2123p123.

corre-

(88)

(89)

the permutation operator p123 maps the sites 1,2,3 of the chain into the sites 3,2,1 correspond-
ingly.

in a similar way the conserved operator of the highest order in the derivatives can be obtained

for the open chain with n  2 gluonic operators and fermions of opposite spin at the ends:

1

2 0...0
12...n = 1
2

h

xi=2

h 00

ii+1

commutes with the charge operator

a12...n = p12...n xn n 1...x21n n 1...2.

(90)

(91)

for simplicity we put the reection matrices k  equal to unity. from eq. (56) one can see
that this implies the transfer matrix to be an even function of the spectral parameter. in our
case we obtain up to insignicant c-number terms

t() = (42  1)(d(4)  2d(3)
2 00

1

 (2  2

2)d(2)
2 00

+ (2  2

(92)

where d(3)
2 00

and d(2)
2 00

are the same as in (38) for the closed chain and

d(4)
2 00

1

= (x2

12x2

2312 + x12x23(x12  x23)1 + x12x2

232 + x23(x12  x23)23.

3 = 2

2 = 2

this coincides with the square of the operator (75), obtained by transposition arguments.
we put here 2

1 + 3/4 in order to achieve that the second order operator d(2)
coincides with c01/2. now the operator d(2) commutes with hamiltonian. thus, for the open
chain (fig. 5), described by the hamiltonian h123 the eigenvalue problem like eq. (67) can
be replaced by the one with the same casimir operator and with the fourth order dierential
operator d(4) instead of d(3) = a as for the closed chain.

so we see that for open chains we are able to nd conserved currents and its number is
just enough to solve the! eigenvalue problem for qcd reggeon interactions. moreover, for

the open chain fig. 5 with one fermion inside again everything is all right. the hamiltonian

for the chain

another chain with two fermions and one gluon is:

2 3  1

12 )] = 0

(97)

(98)

for completeness

let us consider also

the open chain with three fermions

we can deduce following relations:

fig.9

[(1x122x233x232x12 + x122x233x232x121); (2 log x12x23 + log 12

2 3)] = 0

2 3)] = 0 (99)
(100)

thus, all possible open chains with three sites corresponding to gluonic or fermionic reggeons
are integrable. the conserved currents can be derived from the transfer matrix with boundaries
represented by unity reection matrices. the hamiltonians are constructed from the qcd
kernels given above and commute with these two conserved currents given by the second and
fourth order dierential operators respectively. we believe that integrability holds for the longer
open chains too.

6 conclusions

the examples considered above, except for the diculties with the inhomogeneous closed chains,
show the validity of lipatovs conjecture about the deep connection between the kernels of high-
energy qcd scattering amplitudes and the exactly solvable two-dimensional models in the cases
with fermions as well.
in the pure gluonic this connction context has already been used for
the solution of the odderon problem [20]. the case of open chain diers from the closed chain
case by the higher order of non-trivial conserved charge; the fourth order appears instead of the
third.

recently it has been shown that the considered integrable structures appear also in hard
(exclusive and deep-inelastic) scattering [21], corresponding to a dierent limiting region of high
energy scattering amplitudes in qcd.
