abstract

a pedagogical presentation of integrable models with special reference to the
toda lattice hierarchy has been attempted. the example of the k dv equation has
been studied in detail, beginning with the innite conserved quantities and going on
to the lax formalism for the same. we then go on to symplectic manifolds for which
we construct the lax operator. this formalism is applied to toda lattice systems.
the zakharov shabat formalism aimed at encompassing all integrable models is
also covered after which the zero curvature condition and its fallout are discussed.
we then take up toda field theories and their connection to w algebras via the
hamiltonian reduction of the wznw model. finally, we dwell on the connection
between four dimensional yang mills theories and the k dv equation along with a
generalization to supersymmetry.

1 introduction: non-linear equations

linear partial dierential equations, in particular the schroedinger, klein-gordon and
dirac equations, have been known in eld theory over a long time, and have been used in
many dierent problems with great success. non-linear equations, i.e., equations where
the potential term is non-linear in the eld (s), have been known for some time as well.
these equations and their solutions are the topic of the present article.

the earliest non-linear wave equations known in physics were the liouville and sine-
gordon equations. the liouville equation arose in the context of a search for a manifold
with constant curvature. pictorially, such parametrizations may be likened to covering a
surface with a shing net. since the knots on the shing net do not move, the arc length is
constant. the threads in the net correspond to a local coordinate system on the surface.
the liouville manifolds may be reparametrized locally so as to have a metric of the

form:

a = (cid:18) exp 

0

0

exp (cid:19)

(1.1)

so as to be conformally equivalent to a at space metric. the study of such manifolds
with constant curvature led j.liouville [1] to the equation known by his name:

2
xy

= exp 

(1.2)

x and y being local orthogonal coordinates. interest in this equation was renewed in the
70s and 80s due to its appearance in string theories [2,3,4].

the sine-gordon equation, named after a pun on the klein-gordon equation, is an
equation for the angle  between two coordinate lines when the total curvature is constant
and negative. this equation rst appeared in the work of enneper in 1870, and has the
form:

2
xy

= sin()

(1.3)

where x and y are coordinates in a system with constant arc length.

the sine-gordon equation has some interesting solutions known as solitons and
breathers. a soliton satises three conditions. first, a single soliton must have con-
stant shape and velocity. secondly, it must be localized, and its derivative must vanish
at innity. thirdly, if two solutions collide, they should survive the collision with their
shapes unchanged.

principally, there are two types of solitons, one which increases by a xed amount
(say 2), and is called a kink; the other which decreases by the same amount, and is
called an anti-kink.

a breather is a localized solution that varies periodically, and could be considered as

a permanently bound system of a kink and anti-kink.

an interesting property of the sine-gordon equation is that its solutions can be
mapped into others through the baecklund transformation [5], and can thus be used
to create new solutions from known solutions.
it is however impossible to generate a
complete set of solutions from one original solution, via the baecklund transformation [5].
a third non-linear equation which we shall study in some detail, was discovered in
1895 by d.j.korteweg and g. de vries [6], while trying to describe the motion of water-

2

waves in a canal. it has the form:

ut  6uux + uxxx = 0

(1.4)

and is also known as the kdv equation. it has been extensively studied, and many of
the properties of non-linear wave equations that are known today, were discovered in
connection with its solution. this equation was solved by gardner, greene, kruskal, and
miura in 1967 [7-13]. along with n.j. zabusky and c. h. su, they also found many
interesting properties of the same. one of these is that the kdv equation has an innite
number of conservation laws, and that the conserved quantities of each of these laws can
be used as a hamiltonian for an integrable system. this collection of hamiltonians is
called the kdv hierarchy.

there exists a theorem of classical mechanics, which states that if a hamiltonian
system with 2n degrees of freedom has n functionally independent conserved quantities
such that the poisson bracket of any two of them vanishes, i.e.,the integrals of motion are
in involution, the system is completely integrable. it is clear that solutions of systems
with an innite number of conserved quantities must be innitely restricted. a soliton
is precisely such a solution:
it is a localized wave which retains its shape even after
collisions. intuitively, it is clear that for this to happen,there must be an innite number
of conservation laws, and therefore an innite number of conserved quantities. the terms
integrable models and solitons are often used synonymously.

a system of coupled equations of motion describing a 1-dimensional crystal with non-
linear coupling between nearest neighbour atoms, was introduced by m.toda [14] in 1967.
the equations of motion are

m

d2rn
dt2 = a[2ern  ern1  ern+1]

(1.5)

where rn = un+1  un, and un(t) is the longitudinal displacement of the n-th atom with
mass m from its equilibrium position, a being a constant. these models admit soliton
solutions which have been studied experimentally on an electrical network by k. hitota
and k. suzuki [15]. in the continuunm limit, these equations reduce to the kdv equation
[5].

we see that models with exponential interactions are a source of non-linear equations,
the liouville and sine-gordon equations being examples. the liouville equation could
be generalized to include a mass term:

2
xy

+ m2 = e

(1.6)

while the sine-gordon equation could be generalized to the sinh-gordon equation with
the replacement   i. thus

2
xy

+ m2 = sinh 

we also have the toda field theory equations

2i
xy

= ekij j

3

(1.7)

(1.8)

here kij is the cartan matrix for some complex lie algebra. the simplest of these eld
theories is the ar toda eld theory, and it includes the liouville eld theory for the
special case r = 1. there exist generalizations of the toda equations called ane toda
equations, and have an extra term on the rhs, taking the form:

2i
xy

= ekij j + riek0j

(1.9)

here k is an ane cartan matrix, and ri the right null vector for this matrix when r0
is normalized to unity.

these models include the sinh-gordon equation as a special case. both the toda
and ane toda eld theories have an innite number of conserved quantities [16]. they
admit soliton solutions with an imaginary i [17]. both models have been formally solved
by leznov and saveliev [18].

the toda eld theories can be obtained from the toda lattice by setting

whence

i = (i  i1)  (i+1  i)

2i
t2 

2i
x2 = [2ei  ei1  ei+1]

(1.10)

(1.11)

for su(n + 1), showing that the space-independent solutions of (1.11) satisfy (1.5).

since the toda eld theories are the  = 0 limits of the ane toda eld theories,
they could be used to classify 2-dimensional models with a second order phase transition,
with the toda eld theory describing the model at the critical point where it has to be
conformally invariant [19]. hence the great interest in (ane) toda eld theories. how-
ever the precise connection is still unclear. central charges and critical exponents have
been calculated and compared. one hopes that the ane toda eld theories are per-
turbations that correspond to the physical model away from the critical point. however,
more explicit connections are yet to be found.

the method originally used for solving non-linear equations, and especially the kdv
equation, was the inverse scattering method originated by gelfand and levitan [20]. this
involved looking for a linear equation related to the original non-linear equation, and
studying the evolution of the latter. in 1968, p.lax provided this method within a solid
theoretical framework [21]. the lax equation is

where l and m are operators satisfying

lt + [l, m] = 0

and

l = ;

t = m

(1.12)

(1.13)

(1.14)

where  is a scalar, and  a solution of a linear equation which is just the schroedinger
equation for the kdv case ! the lax equation was generalized to the form of a zero
curvature condition which facilitates greatly the form of the transition matrix from the
initial to the nal state.

in what follows, we attempt to give a pedagogical presentation of integrable systems
with special emphasis on the kdv and toda systems. after an introduction to the kdv
equation and its properties, we show how an innite number of conserved quantities arise
via the muira [8] transformation, while detailed calculations are referred to ref.[22]. we
then dwell on solutions of the kdv equation via the inverse scattering method and the
lax formalism [21], after which we obtain the lax operator for symplectic manifolds,
using the toda lattice as an example. the group structure of the toda equations for
su(n) is also studied. the lax transformation was later generalized by zakharov and
shabat [23] to a rst order formalism which was used by ablowitz, kamp, newell and
segur (akns) [24], for a unied description of other integrable models. the essential
features of this approach are also discussed. a fall-out of the above is the zero curvature
condition that facilitates the transition to the quantum case. however, the treatment we
follow is strictly classical.

next we take up the toda eld theories, and after reporting briey the connection
with conformal invariance, dwell on the hamiltonian reduction of the wznw model to
the toda eld theory, which in eect transforms an ane lie algebra to a w-algebra.
(most calculational details are skipped, but may be found in the literature [25]). finally
we refer to the interesting connection between the 4d self-dual yang-mills theory and 2d
integrable models, and the generalization to supersymmetry.

the material is presented as follows. in sect.2, we introduce the kdv equation and
in sect.3, solutions of non-linear equations are taken up, in
its conserved quantities.
particular the inverse scattering method and the lax formalism. in sect.4, we digress
to symplectic manifolds and construct conserved quantities for these manifolds. sect.5
applies the above framework to the toda lattice where the group structure of the toda
equations is also discussed. in sect.6, we take up the unifying rst order formalism of
zakharov and shabat [23], continuing in sect.7 to the zero curvature formalism and its
ramications.
in sect.8, we take up conformal invariance, and introduce toda field
theories which are constructed independently of the toda lattice. in sect.9, we carry
out the hamiltonian reduction of the wznw model to toda field theories. finally
in sect.10, we take up the connection of toda field theories with self-dual yang-mills
models. sect.11 contains some concluding remarks.

2 the kdv equation

the kdv equation was formulated to explain the solitary water waves observed by j.scott
russell in the edinburgh glassgow canal. it is a non-linear equation in one space and
one time dimension and possesses soliton solutions. of this, however, nothing was known
at the time of its formation.

the kdv equation after an initial scaling takes the form

u
t

= u

u
x

+

3u
x3

(2.1)

this equation is galilean invariant, but not lorentz invariant. it can be derived from

the hamiltonian

h(u) = z +



[

u3
6 

1
2

(

u
x

)2]dx

(2.2)

5

where the u(x) satisfy the poisson bracket relations

however, the lagrangian from which it can be derived, is non local:

[u(x), u(y)] = x(x  y)

lkdv =

where

1

2 z +



dxdyu(x)(x  y)

u(y)

t  z dx[

u3

2

(

u
x

)2]

(x  y) = (x  y) 

1
2

,

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

 being the step function. ergo, one cannot write down a local lagrangian whose euler-
lagrange equations yield the kdv equation.

solutions of the kdv equation can be shown to be soliton solutions which travel
without any change of shape. it is the non-linear term which is responsible for the above
property.

what is most interesting about the kdv equation is that it admits of an innite
number of conserved quantities as was shown by miura [8]. this procedure is explained
below.

the kdv equation is related to another equation called the modied kdv (mkdv )

equation, viz.,

v
t

= v2 v
x

+

3v
x3

where v is related to u in the kdv equation through the riccati transformation

u = v2 + i6

v
x

(2.6)

(2.7)

the mkdv equation is however not galiliean invariant. under the transformation

t  t;

x  x +

3t
22 ;

u  u +

3
22 ;

v 

v
6

+

6
2

it reduces to

tv = (

2v2

6

+ v)xv + 3

xv = x[

2v3
18

+

v2
2

+ 2

xv]

this yields a solution of the kdv equation through the transformation

u = 2v2/6 + v + ixv

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

the second form of (2.9) is in the nature of a continuity equation, so that we can identify

as the conserved quantities. v can be inverted in terms of u as

k = z +



dxv(x(t))

v =



x0

nvn(u(x, t))

(2.11)

(2.12)

and this yields vn(u(x, t)) as the conserved densities, since each power of  must indepen-
dently satisfy a continuity equation. that these are also in involution can also be checked,
being explicitly shown by das [22]. some of the conserved quantities are

v1 = ixu1;

v2 = 

u2
6  2
xu;

v3 = ix[

u2
3

+ 2

xu]

3 the lax framework

linear hamiltonian systems with xed initial value problems can be solved using the
laplace or fourier transformations. such methods are inapplicable for the nonlinear
equations and new methods must be found. gardner, green, krushal and miura [9]
managed to solve the initial value problem for the kdv equation in a very ingenious way.
in subsequent years, this method has become the standard method for solving non-linear
systems and goes by the name of inverse scattering theory [20,21]. this method is outlined
in fig 1.

the initial value for the partial dierential equation is used as the potential in a 1-
dimensional scattering problem for a linear equation, e.g. the schroedinger equation. one
then nds the so called scattering data, i.e. discrete spectrum, normalization constants,
reection constants (as a function of the wave number) for this scattering problem. using
the partial dierential equation (pde) evaluated for |x| asymptotically large, (and hence
the pde becomes a linear equation because the potential is assumed to vanish at spatial
innity), the values of the scattering data can be found for all later times. finally, the
scattering data allow one to reconstruct the potential, and hence the solution of the pde
for any later time.

one would intuitively like a better understanding of the origin and relevance of the
linear schroedinger equation. one way to see this is through a generalized riccati relation
of the form:

(3.1)

(3.2)

u + 6 = v2 + i6

v
x

so that the kdv relation (2.1) reduces to

v
t  (v2  6)

v
x 

3v
x3 = 0

as mentioned earlier, a solution of the mkdv equation yields a solution of the kdv
equation through the riccati relation. the simplest way to attempt an inversion of the

7

riccati relation is to linearize it. to that end we dene

so that (3.1) takes the form

or equivalently,

v = i6x/

u + 6 = 6xx/,

xx + (

u
6

+ ) = 0

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

which is, in fact, the time-independent schroedinger equation. there exists however a
more formal theory due to lax [21], which we now elaborate.

given a linear equation described by a time-independent hamiltonian h, and an
operator a whose expectation values are time independent, a(t) is unitarily equivalent
to a(0):

where u(t) is the time-evolution operator with the form

u (t)a(t)u(t) = a(0)

dierentiating (3.6) gives

which implies

u(t) = exp[iht]

u (t)(

a
t  i[a, h])u(t) = 0

a
t

= i[a, h]

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

thus for the expectation value of a(t) to be time independent, the standard time evolution
relation (3.8) must be satised. further, from eq.(3.7) follows the relation

where

is an anti-hermitian operator.

u(t)

t

= ihu(t) = bu(t)

b = ih

this argument is mimicked in the case of a non-linear evolution equation. let

l(u(x, t)) = l(t)

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

denote the linear operator we seek. we assume it to be hermitian, and to have eigen-values
independent of t. for this to be true, one must have u(t)l(t)u(t)=l(0). dierentiating
both sides w.r.t. t, we obtain

u (t)

t

l(t) + u (t)

l(t)

t

u(t) + u (t)l(t)

u(t)

t

(3.13)

unlike the linear case, we do not know the form of u(t). however, u is unitary, so

u u = 1 

u (t)

t

u(t) + u  u(t)
t

= 0

(3.14)

8

thus we can write

u(t)

t

= b(t)u(t)

(3.15)

where anti-hermiticity must be imposed on b. substitution in (3.12), and a little simpli-
cation, yields

l(t)

t

= [b(t), l(t)]

(3.16)

which is similar to (3.8), except for the fact that we do not yet know the form of b.
however, let us assume that l(t) is linear in u(x, t). consequently, the lhs of (3.14)
is a multiplicative operator, proportional to the time evolution operator of u(x, t). this
would ensure that the eigen-values  of l(t) would be time-independent, i.e.,

further, (t) must be unitarily related to its value at t = 0, i.e.,

l(t)(t) = (t)

and its evolution w.r.t. time would take the form

(t) = u(t)(0),

(t)

t

=

u(t)

t

(0) = b(t)(t)

(3.17)

(3.18)

(3.19)

the operators l(t) and b(t), when they exist, are known as the lax pair, corresponding
to a given non-linear evolution equation, and play a fundamental role in determining the
solution. for the kdv equation, l(t) is obtained from the linear form of the schroedinger
equation

l(t) = d2 +

.

(3.20)

1
6

u(x, t); d 


x

by trial and error, b(t) can be chosen so that (3.15) is satised, and a possible solution
is

b(t) = 4d3 +

(du + ud)

1
2

the solution for  w.r.t. t follows from (3.18) and (3.20) to be

t = 4xxx +

1
2

ux + ux + const.

which yields, using the schroedinger equation (3.5):

(3.21)

(3.22)

t +

1
6

ux 

1
3

ux + 4x = const.

(3.23)

a.lenard [26], in an unpublished report, further displayed the relation between the
schroedinger equation and the kdv relation by elegantly deriving the latter from the for-
mer, using only the assumption that the spectral parameter  in (3.4) is time-independent.
i.e., that of the group

the kdv equation exhibits also a fascinating symmetry,

sl(2, r). consider a group element

g = exp[iata]

(3.24)

9

where ta is a generator of sl(2, r), and dene

a  g1g

then the kdv equation follows from the fact that the maurer-cartan equation

a  a  [a, a] = 0
is satised for a special for a special choice of gauge, e.g.,

(3.25)

(3.26)

; ( < 0); a3

a1
1 = 

1 = 6; a2

1 = 

1

u(x, t); a3

0 = a(u(x, t))

(3.27)

4 lax formalism on symplectic manifolds

in this section, we conclude the above study of the kdv equation with a with a short
discussion on symplectic geometry, which is directly relevant for application to the toda
lattice.

a symplectic manifold is one with a preferred 2-form f which is non-degenerate and
closed. the phase space of an integrable model corresponds to a very special symplectic
manifold, since it possesses a dual poisson bracket structure. we assume that there exist
two distinct 2-forms which are both non-degenerate and closed. one way of expressing
the existence of two distinct symplectic structures is to require that the same dynamical
equation be described by two distinct rst order lagrangians l0 and l, where

where

l0 = (0)
 (y) y  h0(y);
l = (y) y  h(y)
dy
dt

;

[ = 1, 2, ...2n]

y =

the euler-lagrangian equations following from (4.1-2) are

where

f(y)y = h0(y)

f(y)y = h(y)

f = (0)
 (y)  (0)
 (y)
f = (y)  (y)

it is easy to see that the two forms f and f are closed, where

f =

f =

1
2

1
2

fdy  dy

fdy  dy

since f and f satisfy the bianchi identities

(4.1)

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

(4.8)

(4.9)

f + f + f = 0;

(4.10)

10

and

f + f + f = 0.

(4.11)

besides, they must also be non-degenerate since (4.4) and (4.5) describe the same dynam-
ical system. let their universes be f  and f , i.e.,

so that (4.4-5) take the forms

ff  = ff  = 


y = f h0(y)
y = f h(y).

we can also construct a nontrivial (1, 1) tensor s

 as

 = f(y)f (y).
s

consistency of (4.4) and (4.5) further requires that

so that after a little algebra, one can show that

h0(y)  h0(y) = 0

df(y)

where

u

(4.23)

can be recognized as a lax equation (3.15), thus providing a lax representation of the
dynamical equations (4.13) and (4.14). one important consequence of (4.23) is that the
set of quantities

kn =

t rsn

can be shown to be invariants since

] = t r[p (s)[s, u]] = 0

(4.25)

(4.26)

p (s) is a polynomial in s. that these are in involution can easily be checked, as done
explicitly in ref.[22]. applied to the kdv equation, the two poisson structures of that
equation are given by the correspondence:

going to the coordinate bases we have

f   d3 +

f   d;

1
3

(du + ud)

f (x, y) =< y | d | x >= (x  y)
f (x, y) =
(xu + ux)(x  y)

(4.27)

(4.28)

(4.29)

(4.30)

so that

f 1(x, y) = (x  y) = (x  y) 

(4.31)
however f 1(x  y) cannot be expressed in a closed form. the lax operator s takes the
form
(4.32)

(du)d1,

s = d2 +

u +

and with a little algebra, (4.23) can be shown to be reduced to the kdv equation, with
consequently an innite # of conserved quantities. this is described in detail in ref.[22].

5 the toda lattice

the model of the kdv equation that has been studied so far is a continuum model. a
nite dimensional system with a nite # of degrees of freedom is simpler to study. the
toda lattice is such a system to which the symplectic approach of the above section
is especially applicable. we now study the toda lattice and its integrability from a
symplectic point of view, following it up with a group theoretical treatment.

the toda lattice describes the motion of n point masses on the line, under the inu-
ence of an exponential interaction. the hamiltonian equations in terms of the canonical
coordinates qi and momenta pi are given by

(i = 1, 2, ....n);

qi = pi;
pj = e(qj qj1)  e(qj+1qj);
p1 = e(q2q1);

pn = e(qn qn 1).

(j = 2, 3, .n  1);

(5.1)

the equations can be cast into a more symmetrical form by enlarging the system to
(n + 2) point masses, with end points at spatial innity. in that case, the hamiltonian
equations take the form :
qi = pi;

(i = 1, 2, ....n); pi = e(qiqi1)  e(qi1qi.

(5.2)

12

we can choose

yi = qi;

yn +i = pi;

(i = 1, 2, ..n).

(5.3)

applying the geometrical method of the previous section, two choices of the lagrangian
are as follows:

n

l0 =

[

xi=1

1
2

(pi qi  qi pi) 

1
2

p 2
i + e(qi+1qi)];

where

l =

n

[

xi=1

1
2

(p 2

i + e(qi+1qi)) qi + i(p ) pi]  h(q, p )

i(p ) =

1
2

n

xj=1

(i  j) pj;

h(q, p ) =

n

[

xi=1

p 3
i
3

+ (pi + pi+1)e(qi+1qi)]

f turns out to have the canonical poisson bracket structure

f = (cid:18) 0  i
0 (cid:19)

(5.10)

(5.11)

(5.12)

(5.13)

(5.14)

(5.15)

so that

f can be shown to have the form [22]

f  = (cid:18) 0
 i

i

0(cid:19)

f = (cid:18) a b
b e (cid:19)

where

aij = i+1,je(qi+1qi)  i,j+1e(qj+1qj)
bij = piij;

eij = (j  i)

the (1, 1) tensor s

 thus takes the form

 = (cid:18) b
s

a

 e b (cid:19)

and the conserved quantities are

t rs = 2t rb = 2

n

t rs2 = t r[2b2  (ae + ea)] =

+ (pi + pi+1)e(qi+1qi)]  h(q, p )

the lax representation (4.23) for the toda equation takes the form of the following matrix
equations

(5.16)

(5.17)
which reduce to the toda equations qi = pi and pi = e(qiqi1)e(qi+1qi) respectively.

5.1 group structure of toda equations

eq.(5.1) can be dierentiated and put in the form

q1 = e(q2q1)
qi = pi = e(qiqi1)  e(qi+1qi)
qn = pn = e(qn qn 1)

it is easily checked that

n

xi=1

qi =

n

xi=1

pi = 0

(5.18)

(5.19)

i.e., the total momentum is conserved, and therefore the centre of mass motion can be
separated and the dynamics of the system expressed in terms of (n  1) coordinates and
momenta. dening
(5.20)

qa = qa+1  qa;

a = 1, 2...n  1,

the second order equations satised by the qas can be written as

q1 = 2eq1  eq2
qa = eqa1 + 2eqa  eqa+1;
qn = eqn 1 + 2eqn

a = 1, ..n  1

which can be compactly written as

qa =

n 1

xb=1

kabeqb

(5.21)

(5.22)

kab being the cartan matrix for su(n). eq.(5.22) generalizes for the other lie algebras
as well.

the lagrangian giving rise to the above euler-lagrangian equations can be written

l =

n

n

xa=1

xb=1

1
2

qakab

1 qb 

n

xa=1

eqa

(5.23)

1 being the inverse of the cartan matrix. the momenta conjugate to qa are dened

as

kab
as

and it is easily checked that

pa =

l
 qa

=

n 1

xb=1

kab

1 qb

{qa, pb} = ab

14

(5.24)

(5.25)

so that {qa, pa} constitute a canonical coordinate system.
the following lax operators:

that the group structure entering above is not just accidental, can be seen by dening

s =

1
2

n

xa=1

[paha + (ea + ea)eqa/2];

u = 

1
2

n 1

xa=1

eqa/2[ea  ea]

(5.26)

(5.27)

where ha and ea are the generators of su(n) in the chevally basis.

the lax equation (4.23) can be seen to be satised, since ds

dt  [s, u] reduces to

1
2

n 1

xa,b=1

hakab

1[qb 

n 1

xc=1

kbceqc]

which is zero by virtue of the toda equations (5.22). hence the quantities

kn =

1
n

t rsn

(5.28)

must be conserved under the ow of the toda equations. since s belongs to the su(n)
algebra, the number of independent conserved quantities can equal (n  1), which is the
rank of su(n). the total number of conserved quantities is thus n, if we add the total
momentum. it can be shown that these are also in involution [22]. this treatment is due
to leznov and saveliev [18].

6 zakharov-shabat formalism

so far we have only studied two integrable models, viz., the continuum kdv and the nite
dimensional toda lattice. in trying to understand the non-linear schroedinger equation
which is also integrable, zakharov and shabat [23] obtained a description which was later
generalized by akns [24] to describe various other integrable models. this approach uses
a lax operator which is rst order in the derivative x, in contrast to the second order
formalism in eq.(3.19). besides describing various integrable models in a unied manner,
this approach has the additional advantage that the inverse scattering method generalizes
readily to the quantum case. in what follows, we describe the rst order formulation of
the lax operator, and elucidate the essential features of this approach. it is easily checked
that if

where

then

l(t)(t) = (t);
tl(t) = [b(t), l(t)],

(t)

t

= b(t)(t),

(t)

t

= 0.

15

(6.1)

(6.2)

(6.3)

(6.4)

we can invert the argument to identify the lax pair in the following way. namely, if

l(t)(t) = (t);

(t)

t

= b(t)(t), with

(t)

t

= 0

, i.e., if the compatibility condition of (6.1) and (6.3) yield the system under study, then
l(t) and b(t) can be identied as the lax pair of the system. we would like l(t) to be
linear in x. using the analogy between the klein-gordon and dirac equations, we dene
a two-component column matrix

and generalize the two equations (6.1) and (6.3) to rst order matrix equations as

 = (cid:18) 1
2 (cid:19)


x

t

= (q+ + ri3);

= (p +q+r3)

(6.5)

(6.6)

where  and 3 are the pauli spin matrices. the dynamical variables q(x, t) and r(x, t)
do not depend on the spectral parameter  which is assumed to be independent of x
and t. the coecient functions p , q and r on the other hand, do depend on , and
are functionals of q and r. demanding that the partial derivatives of  w.r.t. x and t
commute, we obtain the compatibility conditions to be

r
x

= qq  rp ;

r
t
q
t

=

=

q
x  2rr  2iq;
p
x

+ 2qr + 2ip

(6.7)

(6.8)

(6.9)

i.e., if (6.7-9) describe the non-linear evolution of a system, then (6.6) describes the lax
pair appropriate for such a system. explicitly

l =   q+  r
b = p + + q + r3

(6.10)

(6.11)

so that (6.2) is satised.
the choice of r = 6 yields the kdv equation, and the choice r  q = iv/6, the
mkdv equation. the choice q = k and r = k, k being an arbitrary constant
parameter, yields the non-linear schroedinger equation:
it = xx + 2k|  |2

(6.12)

and the choice r = q = 1

2x with

yields the sine-gordon equation.

p = q =

i
4

sin 

16

the operator (l + ) in (6.1) can be rewritten as v(x, t, ) + x, where

if one knows the solution of the associated schroedinger equation at some other point
(x, t) by multiplying the solution by a hermitian matrix t (x, y, t, ), i.e.,

v = q+  r3 + i3

(6.13)

(x, t, ) = t (x, y, t, )(y, t, )

where t (x, y, t, ) is a solution of

xt (x, y, t, ) = (q+  r + i3)t (x, y, t, )

with the initial condition t (x, x, t, ) = i.

7 the zero curvature condition

the lax condition (6.2) can be written as

using

we obtain the form

[t  b, l] = 0

l = x  a(x)

which is like a zero-curvature condition for

[(t  b), (x  a)] = 0

with the identication

f01 = [(0  a0), (1  a1)]

a0 = b(x, ); a1 = a(x, )

(6.14)

(6.15)

(7.1)

(7.2)

(7.3)

(7.4)

(7.5)

the importance of the zero curvature condition stems from the fact that (6.6) may be
solved, using

where the transformation

(x) = t (x, y, )(y)

t (x, y, ) = pr exp[z x

y

a1(z)dz]

(7.6)

(7.7)

where pr denotes path ordering.

it is easy to see that t (x, y, ) translates solutions of the problem along the x-axis

for a xed time, i.e.,

setting

t (x, y, )t (y, z, ) = t (x, z, );

t 1(x, y, ) = t (y, x, );

t (x, x, ) = 1

ur(x2, t2; x1, t1) = pr exp[z x2,t2

x1,t1

adx]

17

(7.8)

(7.9)

(7.10)

(7.11)

and taking the product of two such exponents, it is easy to see that

ur1(x2, t2; x1, t1)ur2(x1, t1; x2, t2) = exp[

1

2 ic

df],

(7.12)

using the baker-campbell-hausdor formula and the stokes theorem, the integration
being done over the area enclosed by the closed path r1 + r2. as the curvature f
vanishes,

and so

so that

ur1(x2, t2; x1, t1)ur2(x1, t1; x2, t2) = 1

u 1

r (x2, t2; x1, t1) = ur(x1, t1; x2, t2)

ur1(x2, t2; x1, t1) = ur2(x2, t2; x1, t1)

(7.13)

(7.14)

(7.15)

ergo, u is independent of the path taken. for a closed path, u(x, t; x, t) = 1. hence path
ordering drops out of the transition matrix t (x, y, ).

returning to the time evolution of the transition matrix, it can be shown that

tt (x, y, ) = [b(x, ), t (x, y, )]

which is the form of a lax equation, so that all quantities of the form

kn =

1
n

t r[t ()]n; k0 = ln[dett ()]

(7.16)

(7.17)

are conserved. we thus have an innite number of conserved quantities when the zero
curvature conditions are fullled. that this holds also for toda field theories was shown
by olive and turok [16].

8 from conformal invariance to toda field theory

that the kdv equation has a hidden conformal symmetry can be seen by making a
fourier expansion with fourier coecients

un = 

1

4 z 2

0

u(x)einx dx
2

n0

(8.1)

it can be shown that the poisson brackets of the un satisfy the virasoro algebra (up to
trivial factors), i.e.,

n(n2  1)n+m
higher order terms in the kdv hierarchy have a hidden  symmetry.

 2i{un, um} = (n  m)um+n +

1
2

(8.2)

we now digress to take a look at toda field theories. these are essentially the
only class of integrable, interacting, conformally invariant eld theories in two space-time
dimensions. to see this, we start with the generic action

s = z [

1
2

ii  v (i)]d2z

(8.3)

18

the trace of the naive conserved energy-momentum tensor becomes

t 
 = 2v.

(8.4)

as the trace of the energy-momentum tensor is required to vanish in a conformally
invariant theory, it seems that if v 6= 0, the theory is not conformal. however there is
an ambiguity in the denition of the energy-momentum tensor. if we attempt to improve
the naive energy-momentum tensor without violating the conservation property, we could
choose

 = t + [  2]f (i)
whence the trace of the modied energy-momentum tensor is

 = 2v + +f

(8.5)

(8.6)

 being the light cone directions. if the second term is to cancel the rst, we somehow
need to get rid of the derivatives. this can be done, using the equations of motion.
without knowing the explicit equations of motion, the most general expression for f (i) is
p cii. using the equations of motion resulting from varying the action , the tracelessness

condition becomes

= 0

(8.7)

2v + xi

ci

v
i

eq.(8,7) is easily solved, with the result that the trace of the energy-momentum tensor
vanishes if the potential is of the form

satisfying the requirement

v (i) = xj

djexp[x bijji],

xi

cibij = 2

(8.8)

(8.9)

we choose bij to be related to the cartan matrix of a simple lie algebra. the resulting
eld theories are called toda field theories, and are described by the action

st oda = z [

1
2

(, ) 

m2
2 x exp ( < (i),  >)]d2x

(8.10)

where <, > is the scalar product in the root space, and  takes its values in the root space
of the simple lie algebra on hand.

the equations of motion obtained from (8.10) are

specializing for the su(n) group, and setting m =  = 1, this becomes

i + m2exp (x kijj) = 0

with 0 = 0 and i+1 = 0, this reduces to

+i = exp (kijj)

+i = exp (2i  i1  i+1)

19

(8.11)

(8.12)

(8.13)

setting

after mikhailov [27], we get the equation

i = (i  i1)  (i+1  i),

t

2i  x

2i = [2ei  ei1  ei+1]

(8.14)

which is easily seen to be related to the toda equations (5.20). one expects that the
toda field theories are integrable, and it turns out that they are indeed so (see ref.[8]).
the calculation rests upon the existence of a zero curvature condition for certain group
theoretical combinations of , which can be chosen as gauge elds.

as mentioned earlier, the toda field theories have been completely solved for simple
g by leonov and saveliev [18]. they have also been solved for ane g by olive and turok
[16].

quantization of the toda field theories is more problematic since the potential has
no local minimum, the latter being attained at innity, using the gauge group a1. a lucid
discussion of the problems encountered in the theory is given in ref.[29].

the central charge of the toda theories can be constructed using free eld technology,

and is found to be [30]

c =

hr
2

+ 12[

h
4

+

v


]2,

(8.15)

r being the rank of the algebra,  being half the sum of the positive roots, and v its
dual. eq.(8.15) gives an indication that a quantum toda theory with a strong coupling
constant is equivalent to another toda theory with a weak coupling constant, obtained
by replacing  by 4/h, and interchanging roots and coroots.

incidentally, strong/weak coupling duality has recently become a subject of immense

study in relation to string theories.

it is possible to obtain the minimal models from the toda field theories. for a
particular value of , the central charges can be made to agree. however this is not
enough. a complication arises from the fact that not all primary elds in the minimal
models are actually present in the toda theory. however, because of the duality in the
theory, we can add another part of the potential with the coupling constant replaced by
its dual; see manseld [31]. this modication is sucient to give complete agreement.

9 w-algebras: hamiltonian reduction of wznw

another fact which makes the conformally invariant toda theories interesting is that to
each such toda theory, there corresponds a w -algebra. the w -algebras are an extension
of the virasoro algebra by adding primary elds primary elds of spin higher than z,
and were introduced by zamolodchikov [32] as a pointer to conformal eld theories with
a larger overall symmetry. zamolodchikov [32] investigated the case in which a primary
eld w(r) of weight 3 is added to the virasoro algebra. in order for the algebra to be
close, it had to be made non-linear, and hence lost its linear lie algebra character.

balog et al [33-35] showed that the liouville and toda field theories can be obtained
as conformally reduced w znw theories. this reduction can be viewed as a gauge
procedure, and the toda eld theory can be obtained as the gauge invariant content of
a gauged w znw theory. the liouville theory is obtained for the special case of the
sl(2, r) gauge group.

20

the most powerful method of constructing w -algebras is through the so-called quan-
tum drineld-sokolov reduction.
in this, one starts with an ane lie algebra, and
reduces it by imposing some constraint on its generators. at the classical level, this
procedure which leads to the so-called gelfand-dickey algebras [36], was pioneered by
drineld and sokolov [37].

it is thus clear that under the reduction that takes a w znw eld theory to a
toda eld theory, the ane lie algebra that characterizes the w znw theory reduces
to a w -algebra that is associated to a toda eld theory. this approach is also readily
generalizable to the supersymmetric case where various new w -superlagebras have been
found as symmetry algebras of supersymmetric toda eld theories. we refer the interested
reader to ref.[38] for further progress in this area.

in what follows, we review the essential steps of the lagrangian reduction of the
w znw model. the w znw action for a non-compact group g in 2d minkowski space-
time is

s(g) = 

k

d2t r(g1g)(g1g) +

t r(g1dg)3

(9.1)

where b is the volume occupied by s2. the left and right ane kac-moody [akm]
symmetries of this theory are generated by the noether currents

j() = t r[(+g)g1];

j () = t r[g1(g)]

where  = k
motion are known to be equivalent to the current conservation

4 , and  is an element of the lie algebra g. the w znw equations of

j = + j = 0.

(9.3)

we now choose the following gauss decomposition of an arbitrary element g=abc, e.g.,

b = exp[

a = exp[ x+
(x
c = exp[ x

1
2

xe];

h)];

ye];

(9.4)

where cartan-weyl root vectors e, cartan subalgebra generators h = [e, e], and
a set of positive (negative) roots  have been introduced with the following properties

k = (h) =

2.

|  |2 ; ,   ;

| long |2 = 2;

t r(h h) =

2

|  |2 k  c;

t r(e e) =

2

|  |2 ,; t r[e, h] = 0.

we also introduce the polyakov-wiegmann identity

s(abc) = s(a) + s(b) + s(c) + z d2t r[(a1a)+b)b1
+(b1b)(+c)c 1 + (a1a)(b(+c)c 1b1)]

(9.5)

(9.6)

(9.7)

(9.8)

we now see, using eqs.(9.4-9.8), that the generalized constraints

j(e) = c
1 ;

j(e = c

2 ;   +

(9.9)

with some real numbers c
1,2 whose values do not vanish only for primitive roots   ,
are enough to reduce the g- based wznw theory to the toda field theory dened by
the lagrangian

where

. due to c
of the gauss decomposition (9.5-7) as follows:

1,2 6= 0 for the primitive roots, the constraint (9.7) can be re-written in terms

a1a = b[x

(9.11)

(9.12)

in the wznw equations of motion, a and c occur only in the combinations given in
(9.11-12), so that they can be eliminated in favour of b or . the remaining equation
is just the toda equation [25,34,35]:

(9.13)

(see also ref.[25] for details).

as mentioned earlier, the toda field theory possesses an extended symmetry rep-
resented by a classical w -algebra. these w -algebras can be obtained as the quantum
versions of the so-called gelfand-dickey algebras [36] known in the theory of kdv equa-
tions. for instance, the poisson bracket associated with the kdv equation in (8.2), results
in the classical version of the virasoro algebra which is the simplest w -algebra. moreover,
the lax representation of the kdv equation (3.15), denes the third order dierential op-
erator b = w(3). the fourier components of b, along with those of the kdv eld, form
the gelfand-dickey [36] algebra that generalizes to w(3) in the quantum case.

now regarding the toda theory as a constrained w znw theory, the hamiltonian
structure can be obtained by a classical drineld-sokolov reduction from the constrained
phase space of the akm algebra. in the hamiltonian formalism, the akm symmetry
of the w znw theory is represented by rst class constraints. the w -algebra of the
toda theory arises as the poisson bracket algebra of gauge-invariant polynomials of the

22

constrained akm currents and their derivatives.
arguments supporting these statements.

in what follows, we summarize the

let g(z, z) be the g-valued w znw elds and j(z) the corresponding akm currents

having the form

g(z, z) = g(z)g(z);

g(z) = j(z)g(z)

(9.14)

let dimg be the dimension of g; l its rank; k the level of the associated akm algebra
g; g the dual coxeter number of g;  the half sum of the positive roots; and  the dual
of .

the constrained w znw theory is specied by (9.9). after a suitable choice of

constants ci, the currents j(z) can be decomposed as

j(z) = i + j(z);

i =

l

xi=1

ei;

l

j(z) =

xi=1

ji(z)hi + x+

e

(9.15)

where {ei} are l simple roots of g. the maximal subgroup of g leaving this form of
currents invariant, is the maximal nil-potent subgroup generated by e, (  +), and
implemented by the (dimg  l)/2 constrained akm currents j (z). this allows us to
interpret the constrained w znw theory as the gauge theory in which all but l of the
(dimg + l)/2 components of j are gauge components [33-35].

the current j(z) and the gauge transformations corresponding to e act on each
column of the w znw eld g(z) separately, while each column contains only one gauge-
invariant component e (of the highest weight), satisfying ee = 0. the gauge degrees
of freedom corresponding to the other elements of each column can be eliminated by a
gauge xing in favour of e. because of (9.15), this leads to a linear pseudo-dierential
equation de = 0, where d is a polynomial pseudo-dierential operator whose coecients
are gauge invariant polynomials in the currents j. this operator d can now be used to
dene a classical w -algebra by choosing a drineld-sobolov gauge in which one has

jds = x wp (z)fp

(9.16)

where p s are the orders of l independent casimir operators of g, and fp generators with
h weights (p  1), so that the gauge-xed current (9.16) has only one non-vanishing
component in each of the l irreducible representations in a decomposition of the adjoint
of g w.r.t. one of its sub-groups sl(2, r). the poisson brackets between the dierent
polynomials wp dene a classical w -algebra.

we close this section by noting that toda eld theories also play an important role
in the discussion of w -gravity, where they arise as eective quantum theories [39,40] for
the w -gravity degrees of freedom in the conformal gauge. for a quantum version of the
w znw  t oda conformal reduction, see [34, 41].

10 self-dual y-m theories: 2d integrable models

the self-dual yang-mills (sdym) theory appears to be a master theory for a whole variety
of 2d integrable systems, as we are now going to explain. though there is no general

23

proof, the statement can be checked on a case by case basis. the main point is that the 4d
self-duality condition admits of a zero curvature representation underlying a hamiltonian
description of sdym descendents in lower dimensions. this makes it possible to apply
the inverse scattering method for integration of the sdym equations. simultaneously, it
explains the origin of gauge symmetries in integrable systems of the kdv type, since the
sdym theory in both gauge and conformally invariant in 4d. and last but not least, this
connection provides us with a systematic way to associate the kdv type hierarchy with
any simple lie algebra.

sdym solutions invariant by the action of a subgroup with two conformal generators
satisfy a 2d dierential equation, since eacd 1d subgroup reduced the number of indepen-
dent variables by one. this allows us to describe the invariant sdym solutions in terms
of a 2d integrable system. all known 2d integrable systems seem to be derivable this
way, by appropriate truncations of a 4d self-dual gauge theory. this is true, in particular,
for the kdv and non-linear schroedinger equations, the liouville and toda equations, as
well as other integrable in 2 and 3 dimensions. our presentation in this section is only
illustrative; we give one explicit example of embedding of the kdv equation into the 4d
sdym theory [42], and a supersummetric generalization.

the invariant metric reads

let xa = (x, y, z, t) be the coordinates of a at 4d space-time of signature (+, +,,).
(10.1)

ds2 = 2dxdz  2dydt

the sdym equations in 2+2 dimensions (xyzt = 1) read as

fab =

1
2

abcdf cd

and are equivalently represented by 3 equations of the form

after a dimensional reduction which is equivalent to setting

ftx = fyz = fty + fxz = 0

(10.3) takes the form

y = z  x = 0,

[t  h, x  q] = [p, b] = 0;

[h, b] = [x  q, x  p ]

(10.2)

(10.3)

(10.4)

(10.5)

where

at = h; ax = q; ay = b; az = p

it is clear that the rst equation in (10.5) is a zero curvature equation. we now choose
the non-compact group and an embedding pattern in the form

0

i

b = (cid:18) 0
q = (cid:18) 

0(cid:19) ;
 u  (cid:19)

1

(10.6)

(10.7)

where  is a constant and u = u(t, x + z). we can expand the lie algebra-valued elds
h and p as

h = h+ + h+ + h33; p = p+ + p+ + p33

(10.8)

24

where  = (1  i2)/2, and 1,2,3 are the pauli spin matrices. it is clear that the second
equation of (10.5) gives
(10.9)

p = p3 = 0,

while the third equation of (10.5) gives

h = p+; h3 = 

1
2

x(u + p



+)  p+

(10.10)

where primes denote derivatives w.r.t. x.

finally, the rst equation of (10.5) yields 3 equations

h+ = up+  xp+ 
u =

1
2

xxx(u + p+) + (u  p+)xu + 22p+

1
2

xx(u + p+);

x(u + 2p+) = 0;

(10.11)

it follows that

p+ = 
1
u =
4

1
2

u; h+ = 
uxxx +

3
2

uux  2ux

1
2

u2 +


2

ux 

1
4

uxx;

(10.12)

changing the notation as

u  u +

2
3

2;

t  4t;

x + y  x,

one obtains the kdv equation

ut = uxxx + 6uux.

this example may be relevant towards an ultimate unication of 2d integrable models
and 2d conformal eld theories, as well as within the 4d sdym theories which are also
closely related to n + 2 strings.

10.1 self-duality and supersymmetry

extended supersymmetry is compatible with self-duality in 2+2 dimensions. therefore
the supersymmetric self-dual yang-mills theory (ssdym) is capable of generating super-
symmetric 2d integrable models. however a supersymmetric generalization of the sdym
theory is not unique. one could either replace a gauge group by its graded version, or a
2+2 dimensional space-time by superspace.

supersymmetric generalizations of the kdv equation in 1+1 dimensions were ob-
tained independently by manin and radul [43], mathieu [44], bilal and gervais [45].
these equations have two dynamical variables, one bosonic u(x, t), and one fermionic
(x, t), and read

tu =

t =

1
2
1
2

uxxx + 3uu +

xxx +

3
2

x(u)

(10.13)

they are invariant under the n = 1 supersymmetry transformations

u = x;

 = u

(10.14)

 being a constant grassmann parameter. eqs.(10.13) are integrable, and can be obtained
from the zero curvature condition associated with the graded lie algebra osp(2, 1)

tax  xat + [at, ax] = 0

when the following ansatz is used for 2d yang-mills potentials [45]:
uxx + 2u2 + x ixx  2iu

2at(x, t) = 


ux
2u
ix

 ux

ixx + 2iu

ix
0

the 2d super kdv can be embedded into the self-duality equations by choosing the
osp(2/1)-valued matrices h, q as h = at(x, t), q = ax(x, t), and b, p as 3  3 matrices
as




(10.15)

(10.16)

(10.17)

(10.18)

(10.19)

it can also be shown that the n = 1 and n = 2 super kdv equations, as well as the
n = 1 super-liouville and super-toda equations, can all be obtained from the n = 2
ssdym theory by dimensional reductions and truncations [46]. a detailed analysis is
however outside the scope of this article.

11 conclusions

it has been our aim to present a birds eye view of the important developments in inte-
grable systems over the past few decades. what has been achieved is possibly a more
subjective viewpoint, related to building connections between sundry topics of immediate
interest. it has certainly not been possible to delve more deeply into the fascinating devel-
opments in ane toda field theory which seems to be a thrust area of research today. we
refer to the excellent lecture series by corrigan [48] on this subject. neither is it possible
to present an account of the interesting link between the kdv theory and matrix models,
encompassing thus 2d gravity; (see ref.[25] for a readable account).supersymmetric toda
field theories have also been given the go by. they were rst studied by evans and
hollowood [49], as well as by leites et al [50]. it seems to be possible to construct toda
field theories based on lie superalgebras with one proviso, namely, that it is necessary
that the lie superalgebra admits a purely fermionic root system. this is only possible
for the following algebras:

a(n, n  1); b(n, n); b(n  1, n); d(n.n  1); d(n, n); andd(2, 1, ).

26

in the generic case, n = 1 supersymmetric theories are obtained, which can be formulated
in n = 1 superspace. there is one special case, namely, the sl(n, n  1) theories have in
fact n = 2 supersymmetry; see [49]. recently, brink and vasiliev [51] have proposed a
model generalizing an toda field theories based on a continuous parameter, such that
when this parameter takes on certain discrete values, the model reduces to the ordinary
an toda theories. more recently, wyllard [52] has worked out a w znw reduction of
these generalized theories, and has also attempted a supersymmetric generalization [53]
of the same.

one could also picture the ane toda theories as integrable deformations of the
conformal toda theories. as an example, by adding an extra simple root to the a1
toda theory, one obtains the ane toda theory, which is also the sinh-gordon theory.
general integrable deformations have been investigated by zamolodchikov, among others,
as an interesting eld. toda theories also appear in many other diverse areas of theoretical
physics, e.g., 1d discrete versions appear in the physics of monopoles [54]. further, certain
3d continuous toda systems are relevant to the classication of hyper-kahler metrics in
4d [55]. finally, it also appears that toda field theories are relevant to m-theory, the
conjectured all-in-all theory encompassing all string theories [56].

i am deeply grateful to prof. s.k. malik, for providing me an opportunity to write
this topical article on the subject of toda field theories. the literature on this subject
is quite vast, but apart from my own interest in lie algebras and super-algebras (which
often draws me into this area because of their obvious relevance to this subject), i have
benetted greatly from some concentrated literature [22,25,56,57]. i am especially grateful
to prof. ashok das for his encouragement, and for sparing time to go through the
manuscript. i would also like to thank jens fjelstad for help with latex.
