a new family of supergravity theories in odd dimensions is
presented. the lagrangian densities are chern-simons forms
for the connection of a supersymmetric extension of the anti-
de sitter algebra. the superalgebras are the supersymmetric
extensions of the ads algebra for each dimension, thus com-
pleting the analysis of van holten and van proeyen, which
was valid for n = 1 and for d = 2, 3, 4, mod 8. the chern-
simons form of the lagrangian ensures invariance under the
gauge supergroup by construction and, in particular, under lo-
cal supersymmetry. thus, unlike standard supergravity, the
local supersymmetry algebra closes o-shell and without re-
quiring auxiliary elds. the lagrangian is explicitly given for
in all cases the dynamical eld content
d = 5, 7 and 11.
includes the vielbein (ea
 ), n grav-
itini (i
), and some extra bosonic matter elds which vary
from one dimension to another. the superalgebras fall into
three families: osp(m|n ) for d = 2, 3, 4, mod 8, osp(n |m) for
d = 6, 7, 8, mod 8, and su(m  2, 2|n ) for d = 5 mod 4, with
m = 2[d/2]. the possible connection between the d = 11
case and m-theory is also discussed.

i. introduction

a good part of the results presented in this lecture were
also discussed in [2] and also presented at the january 98
meeting in bariloche [3] where the detailed construction
of the superalgebra can be found, but it was at the meet-
ing covered by these proceedings where these results were
rst presented.

three of the four fundamental forces of nature are con-
sistently described by yang-mills (ym) quantum theo-
ries. gravity, the fourth fundamental interaction, resists
quantization in spite of several decades of intensive re-
search in this direction. this is intriguing in view of the
fact that general relativity (gr) and ym theories have
a deep geometrical foundation: the gauge principle. how
come two theories constructed on almost the same math-
ematical basis produce such radically dierent physical
behaviours? what is the obstruction for the application
of the methods of ym quantum eld theory to gravity?

ics of fundamental systems: black holes and the structure
of the universe, santiago, august 1997.

the nal answer to these questions is beyond the scope
of this paper, however one can note a dierence between
ym and gr which might turn out to be an important
clue: ym theory is dened on a ber bundle, with the
connection as the dynamical object, whereas the dynam-
ical elds of gr cannot be interpreted as components of
a connection. therefore, gravitation does not lend itself
naturally for a ber bundle interpretation.

the closest one could get to a connection formulation
for gr is the palatini formalism, with the hilbert action

i[, e] = z abcdrab  ea  eb,

(1)

c c

where rab = dab+a
b is the curvature two-form, and
ea is a local orthonormal frame. this action is sometimes
claimed to describe a gauge theory for local translations.
however, in our view this is a mistake. if  and e were
the components of the poincare connection, under local
translations they should transform as

ab = 0, ea = da = da + a

b  b.

(2)

invariance of (1) under (2)would require the torsion-free
condition,

t a = dea + a

b  eb = 0.

(3)

this condition is an equation of motion for the action (1).
this means that the invariance of the action (1) under (2)
could not result from the transformation properties of the
elds alone, but it would be a property of their dynamics
as well. the torsion-free condition, being one of the eld
equations, implies that local translational invariance is
at best an on-shell symmetry, which would probably not
survive quantization.

the contradiction stems from the identication be-
tween local translations in the base manifold (dieomor-
phisms)

x  x = x + (x),

(4)

which is a genuine invariance of the action (1), and
local translations in the tangent space (2).

since the invariance of the hilbert action under gen-
eral coordinate transformations (4) is reected in the clo-
sure of the rst-class hamiltonian constraints in the dirac
formalism, one could try to push the analogy between
the hamiltonian constraints h and the generators of a
gauge algebra. however, the fact that the constraint al-
gebra requires structure functions, which depend on the

1

dynamical elds, is another indication that the genera-
tors of dieomorphism invariance of the theory do not
form a lie algebra but an open algebra (see, e. g., [4]).

more precisely, the subalgebra of spatial dieomor-
phisms is a genuine lie algebra in the sense that its struc-
ture constants are independent of the dynamical elds of
gravitation,

[hi, hj]  hj|i  hi|j.

(5)

in contrast, the generators of timelike dieomorphisms
form an open algebra,

[h, h

]  gijhj|i.

(6)

this comment is particularly relevant in a chern-
simons theory, where spatial dieomorphisms are always
part of the true gauge symmetries of the theory. the
generators of timelike displacements (h), on the other
hand, are combinations of the internal gauge generators
and the generators of spatial dieomorphism, and there-
fore do not generate independent symmetries [5].

higher d the minimal requirements for a consistent
theory which includes gravity in any dimension are: gen-
eral covariance and second order eld equations for the
metric. for d > 4 the most general action for gravity
satisfying this criterion is a polynomial of degree [d/2]
in the curvature, rst discussed by lanczos for d = 5 [6]
and, in general, by lovelock [7,8].

first order theory
if the theory contains spinors that couple to gravity,
it is necessary to decouple the ane and metric proper-
ties of spacetime. a metric formulation is sucient for
spinless point particles and elds because they only cou-
ple to the symmetric part of the ane connection, while
a spinning particle can feel the torsion of spacetime.
thus, it is reasonable to look for a formulation of gravity
in which the spin connection (ab
 ) and the vielbein (ea
)
are dynamically independent elds, with curvature and
torsion standing on a similar footing. thus, the most
general gravitational lagrangian would be of the general
form l = l(, e) [9].

allowing an independent spin connection in four di-
mensions does not modify the standard picture in prac-
tice because any occurrence of torsion in the action leaves
the classical dynamics essentially intact.
in higher di-
mensions, however, theories that include torsion can be
dynamically quite dierent from their torsion-free coun-
terparts.

as we shall see below, the dynamical independence of
ab and ea also allows dening these gravitation theories
in 2n + 1 dimensions on a ber bundle structure as a
yang-mills theory, a feature that is not shared by general
relativity except in three dimensions.

ii. supergravity

for some time it was hoped that the nonrenormaliz-
ability of gr could be cured by supersymmetry. how-
ever, the initial glamour of supergravity (sugra) as
a mechanism for taming the wild ultraviolet divergences
of pure gravity, was eventually spoiled by the realization
that it too would lead to a nonrenormalizable answer [10].
again, one can see that sugra is not a gauge theory
either in the sense of a ber bundle, and that the lo-
cal symmetry algebra closes naturally only on shell. the
algebra can be made to close o shell at the cost of in-
troducing auxiliary elds, but they are not guaranteed to
exist for all d and n [11].

whether the lack of ber bundle structure is the ul-
timate reason for the nonrenormalizability of gravity re-
mains to be proven. however, it is certainly true that if
gr could be formulated as a gauge theory, the chances
for proving its renormalizability would clearly grow.

in three spacetime dimensions both gr and sugra
dene renormalizable quantum theories.
it is strongly
suggestive that precisely in 2+1 dimensions both theories
can also be formulated as gauge theories on a ber bundle
[12]. it might seem that the exact solvability miracle was
due to the absence of propagating degrees of freedom in
three-dimensional gravity, but the power counting renor-
malizability argument rests on the ber bundle structure
of the chern-simons form of those systems.

there are other known examples of gravitation theo-
ries in odd dimensions which are genuine (o-shell) gauge
theories for the anti-de sitter (ads) or poincare groups
[1316]. these theories, as well as their supersymmetric
extensions have propagating degrees of freedom [5] and
are cs systems for the corresponding groups as shown in
[17].

a. from rigid supersymmetry to supergravity

rigid susy can be understood as an extension of the
poincare algebra by including supercharges which are the
square roots of the generators of rigid translations,
{ q, q}    p. the basic strategy to generalize this idea
to local susy was to substitute the momentum p = i
by the generators of dieomorphisms, h, and relate them
to the supercharges by { q, q}  h. the resulting the-
ory has on-shell local supersymmetry algebra [18].

an alternative point of view which is the one we ad-
vocate here would be to construct the supersymmetry
on the tangent space and not on the base manifold. this
approach is more natural if one recalls that spinors pro-
vide a basis of irreducible representations for so(n ), and
not for gl(n ). thus, spinors are naturally dened rela-
tive to a local frame on the tangent space rather than in
the coordinate basis. the basic point is to reproduce the
2+1 miracle in higher dimensions. this idea has been
successfully applied by chamseddine in ve dimensions

2

[14], and by us for pure gravity [15,16] and in supergrav-
ity [2,17]. the sugra construction has been carried out
for spacetimes whose tangent space has ads symmetry
[2], and for its poincare contraction in [17].

in [17], a family of theories in odd dimensions, invari-
ant under the supertranslation algebra whose bosonic
sector contains the poincare generators was presented.
the anticommutator of the supersymmetry generators
gives a translation plus a tensor central extension,

{q, q} = i(a)

 pa  i(abcde)

 zabcde,

(7)

the commutators of q, q and z with the lorentz gen-
erators can be read o from their tensorial character.
all the remaining commutators vanish. this algebra is
the continuation to all odd-dimensional spacetimes of the
d = 10 superalgebra of van holten and van proeyen
[19], and yields supersymmetric theories with o-shell
poincare superalgebra. the existence of these theories
suggests that there should be similar supergravities based
on the ads algebra.

b. assumptions of standard supergravity

three implicit assumptions are usually made in the

construction of standard sugra:

(i) the fermionic and bosonic elds in the lagrangian
should come in combinations such that their propagating
degrees of freedom are equal in number. this is usually
achieved by adding to the graviton and the gravitini a
number of lower spin elds (s < 3/2) [18]. this match-
ing, however, is not necessarily true in ads space, nor
in minkowski space if a dierent representation of the
poincare group (e.g., the adjoint representation) is used
[20].

the other two assumptions concern the purely gravita-
tional sector. they are as old as general relativity itself
and are dictated by economy: (ii) gravitons are described
by the hilbert action (plus a possible cosmological con-
stant), and, (iii) the spin connection and the vielbein are
not independent elds but are related through the tor-
sion equation. the fact that the supergravity generators
do not form a closed o-shell algebra can be traced back
to these asumptions.

the procedure behind (i) is tightly linked to the idea
that the elds should be in a vector representation of the
poincare group [20] and that the kinetic terms and cou-
plings are such that the counting of degrees of freedom
works like in a minimally coupled gauge theory. this
assumption comes from the interpretation of supersym-
metric states as represented by the in- and out- plane
waves in an asymptotically free, weakly interacting the-
ory in a minkowskian background. these conditions are
not necessarily met by a cs theory in an asymptotically
ads background. apart from the dierence in back-
ground, which requires a careful treatment of the unitary
irreducible representations of the asymptotic symmetries

[21], the counting of degrees of freedom in cs theories is
completely dierent from the one for the same connection
one-forms in a ym theory.

iii. lanczoslovelock gravity

a. lagrangian

for d > 4, assumption (ii) is an unnecessary restric-
tion on the available theories of gravitation. in fact, as
mentioned above, the most general action for gravity 
generally covariant and with second order eld equations
for the metric is the lanczos-lovelock lagrangian (ll).
the ll lagrangian in a d-dimensional riemannian man-
ifold can be dened in at least four ways:

(a) as the most general invariant constructed from the
metric and curvature leading to second order eld equa-
tions for the metric [68].

(b) as the most general d-form invariant under local
lorentz transformations, constructed with the vielbein,
the spin connection, and their exterior derivatives, with-
out using the hogde dual () [22].

(c) as a linear combination of the dimensional con-
tinuation of all the euler classes of dimension 2p < d.
[8,23]

(d) as the most general low energy eective gravita-
tional theory that can be obtained from string theory
[24].

denition (a) was historically the rst. it is appropri-
ate for the metric formulation and assumes vanishing tor-
sion. denition (b) is slightly more general than the rst
and allows for a coordinate-independent rst-order for-
mulation, and even allows torsion-dependent terms in the
action [9]. as a consequence of (b), the eld congura-
tions that extremize the action obey rst order equations
for  and e. assertion (c) gives directly the lanczos
lovelock solution as a polynomial of degree [d/2] in the
curvature of the form

ig = z

statement (d) reects the empirical observation that
the vanishing of the superstring -function in d = 10
gives rise to an eective lagrangian of the form (9) [24].

1for even and odd dimensions the same expression (9) can be
used, but for odd d, chern-simons forms for the lorentz con-
nection could also be included (this point is discussed below).

3

in even dimensions, the last term in the sum is the eu-
ler character, which does not contribute to the equations
of motion. however, in the quantum theory, this term in
the partition function would assign dierent weights to
nonhomeomorphic geometries.

the large number of dimensionful constants p in the
ll theory contrasts with the two constants of the eh ac-
tion (g and ) [25,26,15]. this feature could be seem as
an indication that renormalizability would be even more
remote for the ll theory than in ordinary gravity. how-
ever, this is not necessarily so. there are some very spe-
cial choices of p such that the theory becomes invariant
under a larger gauge group in odd spacetime dimensions,
which could actually improve renormalizability [12,16].

b. equations

consider the lovelock action (8), viewed as a func-

tional of the spin connection and the vielbein,

ill = ill(cid:2)ab, ea(cid:3) .

(10)

varying with respect to the vielbein, the generalized

c. the vanishing of classical torsion

obviously t a = 0 solves (12). however, for d > 4
this equation does not imply vanishing torsion in gen-
eral. in fact, there are choices of the coecients p and
congurations of ab, ea such that t a is completely ar-
bitrary. on the other hand, as already mentioned, the
torsion-free postulate is at best a good description of the
classical dynamics only. thus, an o-shell treatment of
gravity should allow for dynamical torsion even in four di-
mensions. in the rst order formulation, the theory has
second class constraints due to the presence of a large
number of coordinates which are actually momenta
[30], thus complicating the dynamical analysis of the the-
ory.

on the other hand, if torsion is assumed to vanish, 
could be solved as a function of e1 and its rst deriva-
tives, but this would restrict the validity of the approach
to nonsingular congurations for which det(ea
) 6= 0.
in this framework, the theory has no second class con-
straints and the number of degrees of freedom is the same
as in the einstein-hilbert theory, namely d(d3)

[23].

d. dynamics and degrees of freedom

imposing t a = 0 from the start, the action is
i=ill[ea, (e)] and varying respect to e, the 1.5 order
formalism [18] is obtained,

varying with respect to the spin connection, the torsion
equations are found,

the presence of the arbitrary coecients p

in
the action implies that static, spherically symmetric
schwarzschild-like solutions possess a large number of
horizons [27], and time-dependent solutions have an un-
predictable evolution [23,28]. however, as shown below,
for a particular choice of the constants p the dynamics
is signicantly better behaved.

additional terms containing torsion explicitly can be
included in the action. it can be shown, however, that
the presence of torsional terms in the lagrangian does
not change the degrees of freedom of gravity in four di-
mensions.
indeed, the matter-free theory with torsion
terms is indistinguishable (at least classically) from gr,
[29]. however, in higher dimensions, the situation is com-
pletely dierent [9].

assuming ill

bc = 0 the equations of motion consist
of the einstein equations (11), dened on a restricted
conguration space.

for d  4, t a = 0 is the unique solution of eqn.(12).
in those dimensions, the dierent variational principles
(rst-, second- and 1.5-th order) are classically equivalent
in the absence of sources. on the contrary, for d > 4,
t a = 0 is not logically necessary and is therefore unjus-
tied.

the lllagrangians (9) include the einstein-hilbert
(eh) theory as a particular case, but they are dynami-
cally very dierent in general. the classical solutions of
the ll theory are not perturbatively related to those of
the einstein theory. for instance, it was observed that
the time evolution of the classical solutions in the ll
theory starting from a generic initial state can be un-
predictable, whereas the eh theory denes a well-posed
cauchy problem.

it can also be seen that even for some simple minisu-
perspace models, the dynamics could become quite messy
because the equations of motion are not deterministic in
the classical sense, due to the vanishing of some eigen-
values of the hessian matrix on critical surfaces in phase
space [23,28].

4

e. choice of coecients

the resulting lagrangian is the euler-cs form.

its

exterior derivative is the euler form in 2n dimensions,

at least for some simple minisuperspace geometries the
indeterminate classical evolution can be avoided if the
coecients are chosen so that the lagrangian is based
on the connection for the ads group,

pld2p =




p (cid:19) , d = 2n  1

(d  2p)1(cid:18) n  1
p (cid:19) ,
(cid:18) n

d = 2n.

(14)

this corresponds to the born-infeld theory in even di-
mensions [26], and to the ads chern-simons theory in
odd dimensions [15,13,14],

1. d = 2n: born-infeld gravity

(19)

the constant  is quantized [16] (in the following we will
set  = l = 1).

in general, a chern-simons lagrangian in 2n  1 di-
mensions is dened by the condition that its exterior
derivative be an invariant homogeneous polynomial of
degree n in the curvature, that is, a characteristic class.
in the case above, (??) denes the cs form for the euler
class 2n-form.

a generic cs lagrangian in 2n  1 dimensions for a

in even dimensions the choice (14) gives rise to a la-

lie algebra g can be dened by

grangian of the form

l = a1ad (ra1a2 +

)    (rad1ad +

ead1 ead

).

(15)

this is the pfaan of the twoform rab + 1
l2 eaeb, and, in
this sense it can be written in the born-infeld-like form,

dlg

2n1 = hfni ,

(20)

where h i stands for a multilinear function in the lie alge-
bra g, invariant under cyclic permutations such as tr, for
an ordinary lie algebra, or str, in the case of a superal-
gebra. in the case above, the only nonvanishing brackets
in the algebra are

l = rdet(rab +

1
l2 eaeb).

(16)

(cid:10)ja1a2 ,    , jad1ad(cid:11) = a1ad .

(21)

the combinations rab + 1

l2 eaeb are the components of
the ads curvature (c.f.(19) below). this seems to suggest
that the system might be naturally described in terms of
an ads connection [31]. however, this is not the case: in
even dimensions, the lagrangian (15) is invariant under
local lorentz transformations and not under the entire
ads group. as will be shown below, it is possible, in
odd dimensions, to construct gauge invariant theories of
gravity under the full ads group.

2. d = 2n  1: ads gauge gravity

the odd-dimensional case was discussed in [13,14], and
later also in [15]. consider the action (8) with the choice
given by (14) for d = 2n  1. the constant parameter l
has dimensions of length and its purpose is to render the
action dimensionless. this also allows the interpretation
of  and e as components of the ads connection [26],
a = 1

3. d = 2n  1: poincare gauge gravity

starting from the ads theory (??) in odd dimensions,
a wigner- inonu contraction deforms the ads algebra
into the poincare one. the same result is also obtained
choosing p = n

p . then, the lagrangian (8) becomes:

g = a1ad ra1a2    rad2ad1 ead .
lp

(22)

in this way the local symmetry group of (8) is extended
from lorentz (so(d 1, 1)) to poincare (iso(d 1, 1)).
analogously to the anti-de sitter case, one can see that
the action depends on the poincare connection: a =
eapa + 1
it is straightforward to verify the in-
variance of the action under local translations,

2 abjab.

ea = da, ab = 0,

(23)

here d stands for covariant derivative in the lorentz
connection. if  is the lie algebra-valued zero-form,  =
apa, the transformations (23) are read from the gen-
eral gauge transformation for the connection, a = ,
where  is the covariant derivative in the poincare con-
nection.

moreover, the lagrangian (22) is a chern-simons form.
indeed, with the curvature for the poincare algebra, f=
da +aa = 1

g satises

2 rabjab + t apa, lp
g = (cid:10)fn+1(cid:11) ,

dlp

(24)

(25)

where the only nonvanishing components in the bracket
are

(cid:10)ja1a2,    , jad2ad1 , pad(cid:11) = a1ad .

thus, the chern character for the poincare group is
written in terms of the riemman curvature and the tor-
sion as

(cid:10)f3(cid:11) = a1ad ra1a2    rad2ad1 t ad .

(26)

the simplest example of this is ordinary gravity in 2+1
dimensions, where the einstein-hilbert action with cos-
mological constant is a genuine gauge theory of the ads
group, while for zero cosmological constant it is invari-
ant under local poincare transformations. although this
gauge invariance of 2+1 gravity is not always empha-
sized, it lies at the heart of the proof of integrability of
the theory [12].

iv. ads gauge gravity

as shown above, the ll action assumes spacetime
to be a riemannian, torsion-free, manifold. that as-
sumption is justied a posteriori by the observation that
t a = 0 is always a solution of the classical equations,
and means that e and  are not dynamically indepen-
dent. this is the essence of the second order or metric
approach to gr, in which distance and parallel transport
are not independent notions, but are related through the
christoel symbol. there is no fundamental justication
for this assumption and this was the issue of the historic
discussion between einstein and cartan [32].

in four dimensions, the equation t a = 0 is algebraic
and could in principle be solved for  in terms of the re-
maining elds. however, for d > 5, cs gravity has more
degrees of freedom than those encountered in the corre-
sponding second order formulation [5]. this means that
the cs gravity action has propagating degrees of freedom
for the spin connection. this is a compelling argument
to seriously consider the possibility of introducing torsion
terms in the lagrangian from the start.

another consequence of imposing a dynamical depen-
dence between  and e through the torsion-free condition
is that it spoils the possibility of interpreting the local
translational invariance as a gauge symmetry of the ac-
tion. consider the action of the poincare group on the
elds as given by (23); taking t a  0 implies

ab =

ab
ec ec 6= 0,

(27)

6

which would be inconsistent with the transformation of
the elds under local translations (2). thus, the spin
connection and the vielbein the soldering between the
base manifold and the tangent space cannot be identi-
ed as the compensating elds for local lorentz rotations
and translations, respectively.

in our construction  and e are assumed to be dynam-
ically independent and thus torsion necessarily contains
propagating degrees of freedom, represented by the con-
torsion tensor kab
 (e, ...), where  is the spin
connection which solves the (algebraic) torsion equation
in terms of the remaining elds.

the generalization of the lovelock theory to include
torsion explicitly can be obtained assuming denition
(b). this is a cumbersome problem due to the lack of
a simple algorithm to classify all possible invariants con-
structed from ea, rab and t a. in ref. [9] a useful recipe
to generate all those invariants is given.

a. the two families of ads theories

similarly to the theory discussed in section iii, the
torsional additions to the lagrangian bring in a number
of arbitrary dimensionful coecients k, analogous to the
ps. also in this case, one can try choosing the s in
such a way as to enlarge the local lorentz invariance into
an ads gauge symmetry. if no additional structure (e.g.,
inverse metric, hodge-, etc.) is assumed, ads invariants
can only be produced in dimensions 4k and 4k  1.

the proof of this claim is as follows: invariance under
ads requires that the d-form be at least lorentz invari-
ant. then, in order for these scalars to be invariant under
ads as well, it is necessary and sucient that they be
expressible in terms of the ads connection (17). as is
well-known (see, e.g., [33]), in even dimensions, the only
d-form invariant under so(n ) constructed according to
the recipe mentioned above are2 the euler character (for
n = d), and the chern characters (for any n ). thus,
the only ads invariant d-forms are the euler class, and

denes the r-th chern character of so(n ). now, since
the curvature two-form f in the vectorial representation

2for simplicity we will not always distinguish between dif-
ferent signatures. thus, if no confussion can occur, the ads
group in d dimensions will also be denoted as so(d + 1).
the de sitter case can be obtained replacing p by (1)pp
in (14).

is antisymmetric in its indices, the exponents {rj} are
necessarily even, and therefore (28) vanishes unless d is
a multiple of four. thus, one arrives at the following
lemmas:

lemma: 1 for d = 4k, the only d-forms built from
ea, rab and t a, invariant under the ads group, are the
chern characters for so(d + 1).

lemma: 2 for d = 4k+2, there are no ads-invariant

d-forms constructed from ea, rab and t a.

in view of this, it is clear why attempts to construct
gravitation theories with local ads invariance in even
dimensions have been unsuccessful [31,34].

since the forms pr1rs are closed, they are at best
boundary terms in 4k dimensions which do not con-
tribute to the classical equations, but could assign dier-
ent weights to congurations with nontrivial torsion in
the quantum theory. in other words, they can be locally
expressed as

pr1rs = dlads

{r}4k1(w ).

(30)

thus, for each collection {r}, the (4k  1)- form lads
{r}4k1
denes a lagrangian for the ads group in 4k  1 di-
mensions. it takes direct computation to see that these
lagrangians involve torsion explicitly. these results are
summarized in the following

theorem: there are two families of gravitational rst
order lagrangians for e and , invariant under local ads
transformations:

a: euler-chern-simons form in d = 2n  1, whose ex-
terior derivative is the euler character in dimension 2n,
which do not involve torsion explicitly, and

b: pontryagin-chern-simons forms in d = 4k  1,
whose exterior derivatives are the chern characters in 4k
dimensions, which involves torsion explicitly.

it must be stressed that locally ads-invariant gravity
theories only exist in odd dimensions. they are genuine
gauge systems, whose action comes from topological in-
variants in one dimension above. these topological in-
variants can be written as the trace of a homogeneous
polynomial of degree n in the ads curvature. obviously,
for dimensions 4k  1 both a- and b-families exist. the
most general lagrangian of this sort is a linear combina-
tion of the two families.

an important dierence between these two families is
that under a parity transformation the rst is even while
the second is odd 3. the parity invariant family has
been extensively studied in [1315,26]. in what follows we

concentrate on the construction of the pure gravity sector
as a gauge theory which is parity-odd. this construction
was discussed in [35], and also briey in [2,3].

b. even dimensions

in d = 4, the the only local lorentz-invariant 4-forms

constructed with the recipe just described are [9]:

e4 = abcdrabrcd
leh = abcdrabeced
lc = abcdeaebeced
c2 = rabrcd
lt1 = rabeaeb
lt2 = t ata.

the rst three terms are even under parity and the
rest are odd. of these, e4 and c2 are topological invari-
ant densities (closed forms): the euler character and the
second chern character for so(4),respectively. the re-
maining four terms dene the most general gravity action
in four dimensions,

i = zm4

[leh + lc + lt 1 + lt 2] .

(31)

it can also be seen, that by choosing  = , the last two
terms are combined into a topological invariant density
(the nieh-yan form). thus, with this choice the odd part
of the action becomes a boundary term. furthermore,
c2, lt1 and lt2 can be combined into the second chern
character of the ads group,

ra

brb

a + 2(t ata  2rabeaeb) = ra

brb
a.

(32)

this is the only ads invariant constructed with ea, ab
and their exterior derivatives alone, conrming that there
are no locally ads invariant gravities in four dimensions.
in general, the only ads-invariant functionals in higher
dimensions can be written in terms of the ads curvature
as [9]

ir1rs = zm

cr1    crs,

(33)

or linear combinations thereof, where cr = t r[(ra
b)r] is
the r-th chern character for the ads group. for example,
en d = 8 the chern characters for the ads group are

t r[(ra

b)4] = c4,

(34)

t r[(ra

b)2]t r[(ra

b)2] = (c2)2.

3parity is understood here as an inversion of one coordinate,
both in the tangent space and in the base manifold. thus, for
instance the euler character is invariant under parity, while
the lorentz chern characters and the torsional terms are par-
ity violating.

similar chern classes are also found for d = 4k. (as
already mentioned, ir1rs vanishes if one of the rs is
odd, which is the case in 4k + 2 dimensions.)
thus, there are no ads-invariant gauge theories in

even dimensions.

(38)

summarizing: the requirement of local ads symme-
try is rather strong and has the following consequences:

 locally ads invariant theories of gravity exist in

odd dimensions only.

 for d = 4k1 there are two families: one involving
only the curvature and the vielbein (euler chern-
simons form), and the other involving torsion ex-
plicitly in the lagrangian. these families are even
and odd under space reections, respectively.

 for d = 4k + 1 only the euler-chern-simons forms
exist. these ar parity even and dont involve tor-
sion explicitly.

as

the

local

stressed here,

symmetry of odd-
dimensional gravity can be extended from lorentz to ads
by an appropriate choice of the free coecients in the ac-
tion. the resulting lagrangians (with or without torsion
terms), are chern-simons d-forms dened in terms of
the ads connection a, whose components include the
vielbein and the spin connection [see eqn. (17)]. this
implies that the eld equations (11,12) obtained by vary-
ing the vielbein and the spin connection respectively, can
be written in an ads-covariant form

< fn1jab >= 0,

(39)

where f= 1
given by (19) and jab are the ads generators.

2 rabjab is the ads curvature with rab

it is easily checked that any locally ads spacetime is
a solution of (39). apart from anti-de sitter space it-
self, some interesting spacetimes with this feature are
the topological black holes of ref. [37], and some black
branes with constant curvature worldsheet [38]. for any
d, there is also a unique static, spherically symmetric,
asymptotically ads black hole solution [15], as well as
their topological extensions which have nontrivial event
horizons [39].

exact solutions of the form ads4  sd4 have also
been found [40] 4 as well as alternative four-dimensional
cosmological models.

all of the above geometries can be extended into solu-
tions of the gravitational born-infeld theory (16) in even
dimensions. friedmann-robertson-walker like cosmolo-
gies have been shown to exist in even dimensions [26],
and it could be expected that similar solutions exists in
odd dimensions as well.

vi. chern-simons supergravities

we now consider the supersymmetric extensions of the
locally ads theories dened above. the idea is to enlarge
the ads algebra incorporating susy generators. the
closure of the algebra (jacobi identity) forces the addi-
tion of further bososnic generators as well [19]. in order
to accomodate spinors in a natural way, it is useful to
cast the ads generators in the spinor representation of
so(d + 1). in particular, one can write,

dlads

t 4k1 =

1
24k t r[(rabab)2k].

(40)

4the de-sitter case ( > 0) was discussed in [41] for the
torsion-free theory. changing the sign in the cosmological
constant has deep consequences.
in fact, the solutions are
radically dierent, and locally supersymmetric extensions for
positive cosmological constant dont exist in general.

which is a particular form of (20) where hi has been re-
placed by the ordinary trace over spinor indices in this
representation.

2n lads

other possibilities of the form (cid:10)fnp(cid:11) hfpi, are not

necessary to reproduce the minimal supersymmetric ex-
tensions of ads containing the hilbert action.
in the
supergravity theories discussed below, the gravitational
sector is given by  1
t 2n1. the  sign
corresponds to the two choices of inequivalent represen-
tations of s, which in turn reect the two chiral repre-
sentations in d +1. as in the three-dimensional case, the
supersymmetric extensions of lg or any of the exotic la-
grangians such as lt , require using both chiralities, thus
doubling the algebras. here we choose the + sign, which
gives the minimal superextension [35].

g 2n1  1

2 lads

the bosonic theory (40) is our starting point. the
idea now is to construct its supersymmetric extension.
for this, we need to express the adjoint representation
in terms of the dirac matrices of the appropriate dimen-
sion. this is always possible because the generators of
the dirac algebra, {i, a, ab,...}, provide a basis for the
space of square matrices. the advantage of this approach
is that it gives an explicit representation of the algebra
and writing the lagrangians is straightforward.

the supersymmetric extensions of the ads algebras in
d = 2, 3, 4, mod 8, were studied by van holten and van
proeyen in [19]. they added one majorana supersymme-
try generator to the ads algebra and found all the n = 1
extensions demanding closure of the full superalgebra. in
spite of the fact that the algebra for n = 1 ads super-
gravity in eleven dimensions was conjectured in 1978 to
be osp(32|1) by cremer, julia and scherk [42], and this
was conrmed in [19], nobody constructed a supergravity
action for this algebra in the intervening twenty years.

one reason for the lack of interest in the problem might
have been the fact that the osp(32|1) algebra contains
generators which are lorentz tensors of rank higher than
two.in the past, supergravity algebras were traditionally
limited to generators which are lorentz tensors up to
second rank. this constraint was based on the observa-
tion that elementary particle states of spin higher than
two would be inconsistent [43]. however, this does not
rule out the relevance of those tensor generators in theo-
ries of extended objects [44]. in fact, it is quite common
nowadays to nd algebras like the m brane superalge-
bra [45,46],

{q, q}  apa + abzab + abcdezabcde.

a. superalgebra and connection

the smallest superalgebra containing the ads alge-
bra in the bosonic sector is found following the same ap-
proach as in [19], but lifting the restriction of n = 1 [35].

set of r antisymmetrized lorentz indices.

the mijs in the n  n block, while the fermionic gener-
ators q have entries in the complementary o-diagonal
blocks.

under a gauge transformation, a transforms by a=

in this case, as in every dimension d = 4k + 1, there is

fact implies that the local supersymmetric extension will

standard eleven-dimensional supergravity [42] is an
n=1 supersymmetric extension of einstein-hilbert grav-
ity that cannot accomodate a cosmological constant
[49,50]. an n > 1 extension of this theory is not
known.
in our case, the cosmological constant is nec-
essarily nonzero by construction and the extension sim-
ply requires including an internal so(n ) gauge eld cou-
pled to the fermions, and the resulting lagrangian is an
osp(32|n ) cs form [35].

vii. discussion

the supergravities presented here have two distinctive
features: the fundamental eld is always the connec-
tion a and, in their simplest form, they are pure cs
systems (matter couplings are discussed below). as a re-
sult, these theories possess a larger gravitational sector,
including propagating spin connection. contrary to what
one could expect, the geometrical interpretation is quite
clear, the eld structure is simple and, in contrast with
the standard cases, the supersymmetry transformations
close o shell without auxiliary elds.

a. torsion. it can be observed that the torsion la-
grangians (lt )are odd while the torsion-free terms (lg)

11

are even under spacetime reections. the minimal super-
symmetric extension of the ads group in 4k  1 dimen-
sions requires using chiral spinors of so(4k) [21]. this in
turn implies that the gravitational action has no denite
parity, but requires the combination of lt and lg as de-
scribed above. in d = 4k + 1 this issue doesnt arise due
to the vanishing of the torsion invariants, allowing con-
structing a supergravity theory based on lg only, as in
[14]. if one tries to exclude torsion terms in 4k 1 dimen-
sions, one is forced to allow both chiralities for so(4k)
duplicating the eld content, and the resulting theory has
two copies of the same system [53].

b. field content and extensions with n>1. the
eld content compares with that of the standard super-
gravities in d = 5, 7, 11 as follows:

standard supergravity in ve dimensions..... the the-
ory obtained with our scheme is the same one discussed
by chamseddine in [14].

standard seven-dimensional supergravity is an n = 2
theory (its maximal extension is n=4), whose gravita-
tional sector is given by einstein-hilbert gravity with
cosmological constant and with a background invariant
under osp(2|8) [47,48]. standard eleven-dimensional su-
pergravity [42] is an n=1 supersymmetric extension of
einstein-hilbert gravity that cannot accomodate a cos-
mological constant [49,50]. an n > 1 extension of this
theory is not known.

in the case presented here, the extensions to larger n
are straighforward in any dimension. in d = 7, the index
i is allowed to run from 2 to 2s, and the lagrangian is a
cs form for osp(2s|8). in d = 11, one must include an
internal so(n ) eld and the lagrangian is an osp(32|n )
cs form [2]. the cosmological constant is necessarily
nonzero in all cases.

c. spectrum. the stability and positivity of the en-
ergy for the solutions of these theories is a highly nontriv-
ial problem. as shown in ref. [5], the number of degrees
of freedom of bosonic cs systems for d  5 is not con-
stant throughout phase space and dierent regions can
have radically dierent dynamical content. however, in
a region where the rank of the symplectic form is maximal
the theory behaves as a normal gauge system, and this
condition is stable under perturbations. as it is shown
in [51], there exists a nontrivial extension of the ads
superalgebra with one abelian generator for which anti-
de sitter space without matter elds is a background of
maximal rank, and the gauge superalgebra is realized in
the dirac brackets. for example, for d = 11 and n = 32,
the only nonvanishing anticommutator reads

{qi

, qj

} =

1
8

ij (cid:2)caja + cabjab + cabcdezabcde(cid:3)

m ijc,

where m ij are the generators of so(32) internal group.
on this background the d = 11 theory has 212 fermionic
and 212  1 bosonic degrees of
freedom. the (su-
per)charges obey the same algebra with a central exten-
sion. this fact ensures a lower bound for the mass as a
function of the other bosonic charges [52].

d. classical solutions. the eld equations for these
theories in terms of the lorentz components (, e, b,
a, ) are spread-out expressions for <fn1g(a) >= 0,
where g(a) are the generators of the superalgebra. it is
rather easy to verify that in all these theories the anti-de
sitter space is a classical solution , and that for  = b =
a = 0 there exist spherically symmetric, asymptotically
ads standard [26], as well as topological [37] black holes.
in the extreme case these black holes can be shown to be
bps states.

e. matter couplings. it is possible to introduce a
minimal couplings to matter of the form aj. for d =
11, the matter content is that of a theory with (super-) 0,
2, and 5branes, whose respective worldhistories couple
to the spin connection and the b elds.

f. standard sugra. some sector of these the-
ories might be related to the standard supergravities
if one identies the totally antisymmetric part of the
contorsion tensor in a coordinate basis, k, with the
abelian 3-form, a[3].
in 11 dimensions one could also
identify the antisymmetric part of b with an abelian 6-
form a[6], whose exterior derivative, da[6], is the dual of
f[4] = da[3]. hence, in d = 11 the cs theory possibly
contains the standard supergravity as well as some kind
of dual version of it.
