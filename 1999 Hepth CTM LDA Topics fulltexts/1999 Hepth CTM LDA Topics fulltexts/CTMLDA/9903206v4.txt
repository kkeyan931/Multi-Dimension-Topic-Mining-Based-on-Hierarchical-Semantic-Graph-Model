abstract

we complete our study of non-abelian gauge theories in the framework of epstein-glaser approach
to renormalization theory including in the model an arbitrary number of dirac fermions. we
consider the consistency of the model up to the third order of the perturbation theory.
in the
second order we obtain pure group theoretical relations expressing a representation property of
the numerical coecients appearing in the left and right handed components of the interaction
lagrangian. in the third order of the perturbation theory we obtain the the condition of cancellation
of the axial anomaly.

introduction

in some preceding papers [16], [17] we have extended results of aste, dutsch and scharf [3], [13], [4]
concerning the uniqueness of the non-abelian gauge theory describing the consistent interaction of
bosons of spin 1.
it appeared that the gauge invariance principle is a natural consequence of the
description of spin-one particles in a factor hilbert space: gauge invariance expresses the possibility
of factorising the s-matrix to the physical space, which is usually constructed using the existence
of a supercharge q according to the cohomological-type formula: hphys = ker(q)/im(q). the
obstructions to such a factorization process are the well-known anomalies. the case when the spin-
one bosons of non-null mass are admitted in the game was studied in [13], [4] for the concrete case of
the electro-weak interaction i.e. when the gauge group is exactly su (2)  u (1).

in [17] we have analysed the same problem considering that the spin-one bosons can have non-null
masses and we did not impose any restriction on their number and masses and we did not took into
account the matter elds. similar results have been obtained in [24]. we have obtained only from the
condition of absence of the anomaly up to the second order the existence of a lie algebra g and the
existence of a representation of this lie algebra pertaining to the higgs elds.

in this paper, we consider the eect of including dirac fermions.

in this way we are able to
investigate a truly realistic model of gauge interactions of elementary particle and, in particular, to
see what are the restrictions on such a model determined by the cancellation of all anomalies. the
main results are the following ones.

(a) the cancellation of the anomaly in the second order of the perturbation theory brings new
relations on the numerical coecients of the left and right handed components of the interaction
lagrangian. more precisely, new group theoretical property appear:

sentations of the gauge algebra: t+
are tr

(i) the coecients of the vectorial and pseudo-vectorial couplings can be organised as two repre-
a with a, b, . . . = 1, . . . , r group indices; the usual notations

a and t

a and tl
a .
(ii) the coecients of the scalar and pseudo-scalar couplings can be organised as some tensor

operators.

some of these relations have been obtained from dierent considerations in [26], [6].
(b) the cancellation of the anomaly in the third order of the perturbation theory gives, essentially,

the usual condition of cancellation of the axial anomaly:

aabc  t r(cid:0)t+

a {t+

b , t+

c }(cid:1)  t r(cid:0)t

a {t

b , t

c }(cid:1) .

(1.0.1)

this is the expression of the adler-bardeen-bell-jackiw anomaly [1], [7], [2], [5], [25], [20], [21],

[27].

some conditions on the couplings of the higgs elds appear if one imposes the additional require-
ment that no nite renormalizations of degree greater than 4 are allowed. this conditions gives the
usual expression for the higgs potential [13], [4] for the case of the standard model (sm). in [24] and
[14] the analysis of the pure boson sector is performed somewhat dierently. we will comment on
that in the next section.

the structure of the paper is the following one.

in the next section we dene the model and
construct the interaction lagrangian including dirac fermions also. then in section 3 we outline the
general setting for the study of the renormalization theory, the general structure of ward identities
and some facts about distribution splitting. in section 4 we construct the s-matrix up to the second
order of the perturbation theory. for the case without matter elds we reobtain the results of [17].
then we consider the coupling of yang-mills elds with dirac fermions and, as anticipated above,

1

we obtain some interesting group-theoretical relations; their complete analysis could x very severely
the possible generalisations of the standard model. we also analyse the conservation of the brst
current in the second order of the perturbation theory. in section 5 we go to the third order of the
perturbation theory. we investigate the dirac fermionic sector and we get the new conditions on the
fermionic representations (a) or (b) from above. in the end we particularise the formalism for the
case of the standard model with one generation of dirac particles. in the last section we comment on
the possibility of removing the anomalies in all orders of perturbation theory.

for the sake of clarity of the rather long and intricate analysis we adopt the mathematical denition

- theorem style of presenting various assertions and computations.

2 general description of the vector bosons

2.1 massive yang-mills fields

in [16] and [17] we have started from the following two facts:

(1) a system of free zero-mass vector bosons can be described in a hilbert space generated from
the vacuum  by applying the free elds a, u, u of zero mass and a factorization procedure induced
by a supercharge operator;

(2) a system of free vector bosons of mass m > 0 can be described in a hilbert space generated
from the vacuum  by applying the free elds a, u, u,  of mass m and a factorization procedure
induced by a supercharge operator.

here a is a boson vector eld, u and u are scalar fermi elds and  is a scalar boson elds; the

elds u, u,  are usually called ghost elds.

for the yang-mills model we combine somehow these two cases. we consider the auxiliary hilbert
space hgh,r
y m generated from the vacuum  by applying the free elds aa, ua, ua, a a = 1, . . . , r
where the rst one has vector transformation properties with respect to the poincare group and the
others are scalars.
in other words, every vector eld has three scalar partners. also ua, ua a =
1, . . . , r are fermion and a, a a = 1, . . . , r are boson elds.

we have two distinct possibilities for distinct indices a:
(i) fields of type i correspond to an index a such that the vector eld a

a has non-zero mass ma.

in this case we suppose that all the other scalar partners elds ua, ua, a have the same mass ma.

(ii) fields of type ii correspond to an index a such that the vector eld a

a has zero mass. in this
case we suppose that the scalar partners elds ua, ua also have the zero mass but the scalar eld a
can have a non-zero mass: mh

a  0. it is convenient to use the compact notation

a  (cid:26) ma
m

mh
a

for ma 6= 0
for ma = 0

(2.1.1)

then the following following equations of motion describe the preceding construction:

((cid:3) + m2

a)ua(x) = 0,

((cid:3) + m2

a)ua(x) = 0,

((cid:3) + (m

a)2)a(x) = 0,

a = 1, . . . , r.

(2.1.2)

we also postulate the following canonical (anti)commutation relations:

{ua(x), ub(y)} = abdma(x  y)  1,

[aa(x), ab (y)] = abg dma(x  y)  1,
a(x  y)  1;

[a(x), b(y)] = abdm

(2.1.3)

all other (anti)commutators are null.

in this hilbert space we suppose given a sesquilinear form < ,  > such that:

aa(x) = aa(x),

ua(x) = ua(x),

ua(x) = ua(x), a(x) = a(x).

(2.1.4)

the ghost degree is 1 for the elds ua, ua,
one can dene the brst supercharge q by:

a = 1, . . . , r and 0 for the other elds.

{q, ua} = 0 {q, ua} = i(a

a + maa)
a = 1, . . . , r

{q, a

a } = iua

{q, a} = imaua,

and

q = 0.

3

(2.1.5)

(2.1.6)

then one can justify that the physical hilbert space of the yang-mills system is a factor space

hr

y m  h  ker(q)/ran(q).

(2.1.7)

the sesquilinear form < ,  > induces a bona de scalar product on the hilbert factor space.
the factorization process leads to the following physical particle content of this model:

 for ma > 0 the elds a

a , ua, ua, a describe a particle of mass ma > 0 and spin 1; this are

the so-called heavy bosons [17].

 for ma = 0 the elds a

a , ua, ua describe a particle of mass 0 and helicity 1; the typical example

is the photon [16].

 for ma = 0 the elds a describe a scalar elds of mass mh

a ; this are the so-called higgs elds.

this framework is sucient for the study of the standard model (sm) of the electro-weak interac-
tions: indeed one takes r = 4 and considers that there are three elds of type i and one eld of type
ii. the scalar eld appearing in the last case can be considered as the higgs eld.

to include also quantum chromodynamics one must consider that there is a third case:
(iii) fields of type iii correspond to an index a such that the vector eld a

a has zero mass, the

scalar partners ua, ua also have zero mass but the scalar eld a is absent.

in [24] and [14] the model is constructed somewhat dierently: one eliminates the elds of type ii
and includes a number of supplementary scalar bosonic elds i of masses mi  0. in this framework
one can consider for instance the very interesting higgs-kibble model in which there are no zero-mass
particle, so the adiabatic limit probably exists.

one can preserve the general framework with only two types of indices if we consider that in case

ii there are in fact three subcases (i.e three types of indices a for which ma = 0):

(iia) in this case aa, ua, ua, a 6 0;
(iib) in this case a  0;
(iic) in this case aa, ua, ua  0.
one must modify appropriately the canonical (anti)commutation relations (2.1.3) to avoid con-
tradiction for some values of the indices. one has some freedom of notation: for instance, one can
eliminate case (iia) if one includes the rst three elds elds in case (iib) and the last one in case
(iic). the relations (2.1.5) are not aected in this way.

let us consider the set of wick monomials w constructed from the free elds a

a , ua, ua and a
for all indices a = 1, . . . , r; we dene the brst operator dq : w  w as the (graded) commutator
with the supercharge operator q. then one can prove easily that:

d2
q = 0.

(2.1.8)

the class of observables on the factor space is dened as follows: an operator o : hgh,r

y m  hgh,r
y m
induces a well dened operator [o] on the factor space ker(q)/im(q)  fm if and only if it veries:
dqo|ker(q) = 0. because of the relation (2.1.8) not all operators verifying the condition (2.1) are
interesting. in fact, the operators of the type dqo are inducing a null operator on the factor space;
explicitly, we have:

[dqo] = 0.

(2.1.9)

the canonical dimension (w ) of certain wick monomial is dened according to the usual pre-

scription. by denition, a wick polynomial is a sum of wick monomials.

4

we will construct a perturbation theory a la epstein-glaser using this set of free elds and impos-
ing the usual axioms of causality, unitarity and relativistic invariance on the chronological products
t (x1, . . . , xn). moreover, we want that the result factorizes to the physical hilbert space in the
adiabatic limit. this amounts to

= 0,

n  1.

(2.1.10)

lim0 dqz(r4)n

dx1    dxng(x1)    g(xn)t (x1, . . . , xn)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ker(q)

if this condition if fullled, then the chronological and the antichronological products do factorise
to the physical hilbert space and they give a perturbation theory verifying causality, unitarity and
relativistic invariance.

one may raise at this point the rather serious objection that the adiabatic limit probably does
not exists. one way to cure this problem is to replace the condition of factorisation (2.1.10) by the
innitesimal version postulated in [3] - [13], namely:

dqt (x1, . . . , xn) = i

n

xl=1


x
l

t 
l (x1, . . . , xn)

(2.1.11)

for some auxiliary chronological products t 
l = 1, . . . , n which must be determined
recurringly, together with the standard chronological products, and to construct the s-matrix s(g)
for a test function g, that is without performing the adiabatic limit g  1.

l (x1, . . . , xn),

however, this point of view is not without problems. indeed, if one imposes (2.1.11) instead of
(2.1.10), then the s-matrix so constructed will not factorize to the physical space ker(q)/im(q)
which raises the question about its physical relevance. to this one must add the rather unpleasant
fact that one abandons the consistency condition (2.1.10) which has a direct physical relevance (the
possibility of constructing an s-matrix in the physical space ker(q)/im(q)) for an independent
postulate (2.1.11). on the other hand, the rather close connection between (2.1.10) and (2.1.11)
suggests that there must exists a common cure for both types of problems. that is, if one can nd
a reasonable solution of the adiabatic limit problem, then it is reasonable to conjecture that one will
be able to strengthen the mathematical status of (2.1.10) and, eventually, prove its equivalence with
(2.1.11). in this case the consistency condition can be also written in the following form:

dqz(r4)n

dx1    dxng(x1)    g(xn)t (x1, . . . , xn)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ker(q)

= o(),

n  1

(2.1.12)

in the sense of innitesimal calculus of dieudonne. in what follows, the interpretation of the right
hand side of the preceding relations will be a integrated divergence. in other words, to avoid various
problems we will use in fact the formal adiabatic limit condition given by (2.1.11). a more detailed
discussion on this point can be found in [17].

by a trivial lagrangian we mean a wick expression of the type

l(x) = dqn (x) + i


x l(x)

(2.1.13)

with l(x) and l(x) some wick polynomials. the rst term in the previous formula gives zero by
factorisation to the physical hilbert space (according to a previous discussion) and the second one
gives also zero in the adiabatic limit; this justify the elimination of such expression from the rst order
chronological product t (x).

5

if one completely exploits the condition of gauge invariance in the rst order of perturbation theory
obtaining the generic form of the yang-mills interaction of spin-one bosons up to a trivial lagrangian.
we assume the summation convention of the dummy indices a, b, . . . = 1, . . . , r. the result from [17]
is:

theorem 2.1 let us consider the operator t (x) dened on hgh,r
y m as a lorentz-invariant wick poly-
nomial in a
a (x), ua(x), ua(x), a(x) such that every term has canonical dimension 3 of 4. if it
veries the formal adiabatic limit condition then it has, up to a trivial lagrangian, the following form:

+f 

abc [: a(x)b(x)a

t y m (x) = fabc [: aa(x)ab (x) a
c (x) : mb : a(x)ab(x)a
+f 

c (x) :  : a
a (x)ub(x) uc(x) :] ,
c (x) : mb : a(x)ub(x)uc(x) :]
abc : a(x)b(x)c(x) : +gabcd : a(x)b(x)c(x)d(x) :

(2.1.14)

the various constants from the preceding expression are constrained by the following conditions:
- the expressions fabc are completely antisymmetric

fabc = fbac = facb

and verify:

(ma  mb)fabc = 0,

i mc = 0,

a, b = 1, . . . , r;

- the expressions f 

abc are antisymmetric in the indices a and b:

f 
abc = f 

bac,

verify the relation:

(2.1.15)

(2.1.16)

(2.1.17)

(mh

a  mh

b )f 

abc = 0,

i ma = mb = mc = 0,

a, b = 1, . . . , r

(2.1.18)

and are connected to fabc by:

fabcmc = f 

cabma  f 

cbamb,

a, b, c = 1, . . . , r;

(2.1.19)

- the expressions f 

abc remain undetermined for ma = mb = mc = 0 and for the opposite case are

given by:

for mc 6= 0.

f 
abc =

1

6mc

f 

abc(cid:2)(m

a)2  (m

b )2  m2

a + m2
b(cid:3) ,

(2.1.20)

- the expressions gabcd are non-zero only for ma = mb = mc = md = 0 and in this case they are

completely symmetric.

remark 2.2 the presence of indices of type iib and iic is taken into account by requiring that the
constants from t (x) are null if one of the indices a, b, c takes such values. one can see that this does
not aect the equations from the statement of the theorem.

we also have:

6

corollary 2.3 in the condition of the preceding theorem, one has:

dqt (x) = it (x)

where:

t  = fabc(cid:18): uaabf 

c

: 

1
2

: uaub uc :(cid:19) + f 

abc (ma : a

a buc : + : abuc :) .

(2.1.21)

(2.1.22)

the expression t (x) from the preceding theorem veries the unitarity condition

t (x) = t (x)

if and only if the constants fabc, f 

abc and f abc, have real values; it also veries the causality condition:

[t (x), t (y)] = 0,

x, y  r4

s.t.

(x  y)2 < 0.

we close this subsection with some remarks.

remark 2.4 one can see that the necessity of using ghost elds stems from the fact that there seems
to be impossible to construct the interaction lagrangian without them. however, from a fundamental
point of view, one can consider them only as some catalysers [14] and hope that one will be able to
reformulate the whole theory without them.

remark 2.5 in the rst order analysis one can also use instead of the formal adiabatic limit condition
(2.1.11) the more physical condition (2.1.10) because no problems connected with the adiabatic limit
exists in this case. however, as notices in [13], the condition does essentially eliminate the tri-linear
terms and one looses a lot of the information of the preceding theorem. this is another indication that
one should work with the formal adiabatic limit condition.

remark 2.6 in [8] one can nd a discussion showing that trivial lagrangians do not produce eects
in the higher orders of perturbation theory.

2.2 yang-mills fields coupled to matter

we study here the possibility of coupling yang-mills elds to matter. we suppose that we are given
the hilbert space of matter hmatter which is ussually also a fock space. then the coupled system
is described in the tensor product hilbert space fy m  hmatter. one can describe this fock space
considering hgh,r
y m  hmatter with the corresponding supercharge operator and forming the
quotient ker(q)/im(q). we will consider here that the matter is formed from dirac fermions
only.

y m  hgh,r

first, we generalize theorem 2.1:

theorem 2.7 let us consider the operator t (x) dened on hgh,r
y m which is a lorentz-invariant wick
polynomial in a
a (x), ua(x) , ua(x) , a(x) and the matter elds such that every term has canonical
dimension 3 or 4. then t (x) veries the formal adiabatic limit condition, if and only if, up to a trivial
lagrangian it has the following form:

t (x) = t y m (x) + a

a (x)ja(x) + xma6=0

1
ma

a(x)j

a (x) + xma=0

a(x)ja(x) + tmatter(x)

(2.2.1)

7

here t y m (x) has been dened in theorem 2.1, ja and ja are lorentz covariant currents build only
from the matter elds with (ja) = 1, 2, 3 and tmatter(x) contains only the matter elds. moreover
the following conservation law should be valid:

j

a (x) = 0,

ma = 0.

the expression for t (x) veries the unitarity requirement if and only if we have:

a (x) = j
j

a (x),

a = 1, . . . , r,

ja(x) = ja(x),

ma = 0

and veries the causality condition if and only if:

[j

a (x), j

b (y)] = 0,

(x  y)2 < 0,

a, b = 1, . . . , r,

[ja(x), jb(y)] = 0,

(x  y)2 < 0,

ma = mb = 0,

[j

a (x), jb(x)] = 0,

(x  y)2 < 0,

mb = 0.

(2.2.2)

(2.2.3)

(2.2.4)

(2.2.5)

(2.2.6)

proof:
beside the terms considered in theorem 2.1 we have to include terms containing explicitly the dirac

fermions. lorentz covariance and power counting limit these terms to tmatter(x) and:

tmatter(x)  a

a (x)ja(x) + a(x)ja(x)

(2.2.7)

with ja (ja) a lorentz covariant (resp.
proof of theorem 2.1, we obtain a supplementary restriction, namely:

invariant) operator. proceeding in the same way as for the

in other words, for ma = 0 we get (2.2.2) and for ma 6= 0 we get:

maja = j
a ,

a = 1, . . . , r.

ja =

1
ma

j
a .

(2.2.8)

(2.2.9)

the expression from the statement emerges. the other assertions are straightforward, although

rather tedious to verify. (cid:4)

it is clear if the hilbert space of the matter elds is also a fock space and the currents are build

from wick monomials, then the commutation relations (2.2.6) are always veried.

corollary 2.8 the following formula is true

dqt (x) = i


x t (x)

(2.2.10)

where t (x) is obtained by adding to the corresponding expression from the pure yang-mills case - see
(2.1.22) - the following contribution due to the presence of matter:

t 
matter(x)  ua(x)j

a (x).

(2.2.11)

now we get in detail the structure of the interaction lagrangian in the following two propositions.

we have:

8

proposition 2.9 suppose that the dirac fermions generating hmatter are a of masses ma 
0, a = 1, . . . , n . then the generic form of the currents from the preceding theorem are:

a (x) =: a(x)(ta)abb(x) : + : a(x)(t
j

a)ab5b(x) :

and

ja(x) =: a(x)(sa)abb(x) : + : a(x)(s

a)ab5b(x) :

(2.2.12)

(2.2.13)

the causality conditions from theorem 2.7 are fullled and the hermiticity conditions are equivalent
a =

a = 1, . . . r are hermitian and s
a,

t
a,

sa,

with the fact that the complex n  n matrices ta,
1, . . . , r anti-hermitian.

the contributions with (without) the matrix 5 is called axial (resp. vectorial) current. let us

dene the mass matrix by:

then we have:

mab  a,bma,

a, b = 1, . . . , n.

(2.2.14)

proposition 2.10 the following mass relations are true:

sa =

i
ma

[m, ta],

s
a =

i
ma

{m, t

a},

ma 6= 0,

[m, ta] = 0,

{m, t

a} = 0,

ma = 0.

(2.2.15)

(2.2.16)

in particular, the matrices ta,

ma = 0 can be exhibited into a block diagonal structure (eventually
after a relabelling of the dirac elds) and the masses corresponding to the same block must be equal.

proof: it is easy to show that the conservation law (2.2.8) is equivalent to the two relations from

the statement. (cid:4)

corollary 2.11 let us dene

a  ta + t
t
a,

a  sa + s
s

a = 1, . . . , r,

s
a =

(m t

a m ),

ma 6= 0,

m t

a = t

a m,

ma = 0

and the hermiticity conditions are equivalent to:

a = 1, . . . , r,

3 perturbation theory

3.1 the general framework

we give here the basic ideas of a multi-lagrangian perturbation theory following [15] and [18]. one
can argue that the s-matrix is formal series of operator valued distributions:

s(g) = 1 +



xn=1

in

n! zr4n

dx1    dxn tj1,...,jn(x1,    , xn)gj1(x1)    gjn(xn),

(3.1.1)

where g = (gj(x))j=1,...p is a multi-valued tempered test function in the minkowski space r4 that
switches the interaction and tj1,...,jn(x1,    , xn) are operator-valued distributions acting in the fock
space of some collection of free elds with a common dense domain of denition d0. these operator-
valued distributions are called chronological products and verify some properties called bogoliubov
axioms. we note that there is a canonical association of the point xi and the index ji. one starts
from a set of interaction lagrangians tj(x),
j = 1, . . . , p and tries to construct the whole series
tj1,...,jn, n  2.

we outline briey the set of axioms imposed on the chronological products tj1,...,jn; we do not give
the explicit formul because they are well known in the literature and can be found in the references
quoted above.

 symmetry: this axiom describes the behaviour of the chronological products with respect to the

permutation of the couples (xi, ji).

 poincare invariance:

this axiom describes the behaviour of the chronological products with
respect to the action of the poincare group in the fock space of the system. essentially is a
tensorial covariance condition.

 causality:

it describes factorization properties of the chronological products for causally sep-
arated arguments. this seems to be the central axiom of this axiomatic approach; it plays a
major role in other axiomatic schemes as well.

 unitarity: this axiom is considered in the sense of formal series.

a renormalization theory is the possibility to construct such a s-matrix starting from the rst
j = 1, . . . , p which are linearly independent wick polynomials called interaction
order terms: tj(x),
lagrangians which should verify the corresponding axioms expressing the behaviour with respect to
poincare transformations, hermitian conjugation and commutation properties for space-like separated
arguments.

the case of a single lagrangian corresponds to a single coupling constant, that is p = 1 and in
that case the chronological products will be operators t (x) without any indices. however, it is more
convenient to consider that the interaction lagrangian is given by the sum

with cj some real constants. in this case, the chronological products of the theory are

t (x) = x cjtj(x)

t (x) = x cj1 . . . cjntj1,...,jn(x).

10

(3.1.2)

(3.1.3)

it can be showed that that one must consider the given interaction lagrangians tj(x) to be all
wick monomials canonical dimension j  4 (j = 1, . . . , p ) acting in the fock space of the system.
because the fock space is generated by some free relativistic elds acting on the vacuum  it is easy
to see that there always have covariance properties with respect to poincare transformations.

if there are non-hermitian free elds acting in the fock space, we have in general:

tj(x) = tj (x)

(3.1.4)

where j  j is a bijective map of the numbers 1, 2, . . . , p .

if there are fermi or ghost elds acting in the fock space, the causality property is in general:

tj1(x1)tj2(x2) = (1)j1 j2 tj2(x2)tj1(x1),

x1  x2.

(3.1.5)

here i is the number of fermi and ghost elds factors in the wick monomial tj; if j is even
(odd) we call the index j even (resp. odd). one has to keep track of these signs in the symmetry
axiom for the chronological products.

it is convenient to let the index j have the value 0 also and we put by denition

t0  1.

(3.1.6)

moreover, we dene a new sum operation of two indices j1, j2 = 1, . . . , p ; this summation is

denoted by + but should not be confused with the ordinary sum. by denition we have:

tj1+j2(x) = c : tj1(x)tj2(x) :

(3.1.7)

for some positive constant c. we dene componentwise the summation for n-tuples j = {j1, . . . , jn}.
the new summation is non-commutative if fermi or ghost elds are present.

we will use the notation

j  xjj

j

(3.1.8)

and we call it the canonical dimension of tj (x).

let us denote by (d) the order of singularity of the numerical distribution d. we use the denition

from [23] although one can also use the scaling degree introduced by steinmann (see [10]).

then we add a new axiom, namely the following wick expansion property of the chronological

products is valid:

tj (x) = xk+l=j



tk(x) wl(x)

(3.1.9)

where: (a) tk(x) are numerical distributions (the renormalized feynman amplitudes); (b) the degree
of singularity is restricted by the following relation:

(tk )  k  4(n  1);

(3.1.10)

(c)  is the sign coming from permutation of fermi elds; (d) we have introduced the notation

let us notice that from (3.1.9) we have:

wj (x) : tj1(x1)    tjn(xn) :

tj (x) =< , tj (x) > .

11

(3.1.11)

(3.1.12)

in particular, these numerical distributions have causal support and are poincare covariant; trans-

lation invariance implies that they are in fact distributions in m = 4(|x|  1) variables.

the recursive construction assumes that we have the expressions tj (x) for |x|  n  1 verifying
all the properties and tries to construct them for x = n. the basic object is the commutator function:

dj1,...,jn(x1, . . . , xn1; xn)  a

j1,...,jn(x1, . . . , xn1; xn)  r

j1,...,jn(x1, . . . , xn1; xn)

(3.1.13)

where

and

a

j1,...,jn(x1, . . . , xn1; xn)  x
j1,...,jn(x1, . . . , xn1; xn)  x

r

x1,x2p art(x)

(1)|x2|tj1(x1) tj2(x2)

(3.1.14)

x1,x2p art(x)

(1)|x2| tj2(x2)tj1(x1);

(3.1.15)

the sums p run over the partitions verifying x2 6= ,

xn  x1.

the commutator function can be proved to be poincare covariant and to have causal support i.e.

supp(dj1,...,jn(x1, . . . , xn1; xn))  +(xn)  (xn) where we use standard notations:

(xn)  {(x1, . . . , xn)  (r4)n|xi  xn  v ,

i = 1, . . . , n  1}.

(3.1.16)

moreover, a formula similar to (3.1.9) is true:

dj (x) = xk+l=j

 dk (x) wl(x)

(3.1.17)

where dk(x) are numerical distributions; in analogy to (3.1.12) we have:

it follows that the numerical distributions dj (x) have causal support i.e supp(dj (x))  +(xn) 

(xn) and are sl(2, c)-invariant. moreover, their degree of singularity is restricted by

dj (x) =< , dj (x) > .

(3.1.18)

(dk )  k  4(n  1);

(3.1.19)

this is the content of the power counting theorem. one knows that there exists a causal splitting

dj = aj  rj ,

supp(aj )  +(xn),

supp(rj )  (xn)

(3.1.20)

which is also sl(2, c)-invariant and such that the order of the singularity is preserved. so, there
exists a sl(2, c)-covariant causal splitting:

dj (x) = aj (x)  rj (x),

|x| = n

(3.1.21)

with supp(aj1,...,jn(x1, . . . , xn1; xn))  +(xn) and supp(rj1,...,jn(x1, . . . , xn1; xn))  (xn).

let us dene

tj (x)  aj (x)  a

j (x) = rj (x)  r

j (x).

(3.1.22)

then these expressions satisfy the sl(2, c)-covariance, and causality axioms. one can also x uni-
tarity and symmetry.

we end this subsection with an important remark. let us consider some general wick polynomials

ai(x) = xj

cij tj(x),

i = 1, 2, . . .

(3.1.23)

12

then we can dene the chronological products:

t (a1(x1),    , an(xn))  xj

ci1j1    cinjn tj1,...,jn(x1,    , xn).

(3.1.24)

one can nd in [10] a system of axioms for the expressions t (a1(x1),    , an(xn)) which is equiv-

alent to the bogoliubov set of axioms.

3.2 ward identities

as we have said in the subsection 2.1 the problem is to construct the whole series t (x) such that
one has the gauge invariance condition in all orders of the perturbation theory at the same time with
the other bogoliubov axioms.

in general we have something more general than relation (3.1.2):

with cj,

t (x) = x cjtj(x) t (x) = x c

j tj(x)

c
j some real constants; then we will have something more general than (3.1.3):
t (x) = x cj1    cjntj1,...,jn(x),

l (x) = x cj1 . . . c
t 

. . . cjntj1,...,jn(x)

jl

in particular, the following conventions hold:

t ()  1, t 

l ()  0,

t 
l (x)  0,

for xl 6 x.

then the gauge invariance condition (2.1.11) can be written more compactly as follows:

dqt (x) = ix 

x
l

t 
l (x).

(3.2.1)

(3.2.2)

(3.2.3)

(3.2.4)

we suppose that these relations are true up to order |x|  n  1 and investigate the possible
obstructions in order n. the procedure used in [11], [12] and [16], [17] amounts to the following. let
us dene the operator distributions d(x) and d
l (x) in analogy to the relations (3.2.2). then it can
be proved that we have:

n

dqd(x) = i

xl=1


x
l

d

l (x),

|x| = n.

(3.2.5)

we can express this condition in terms of numerical distributions. according to the relation (3.1.9)
and wick theorem we must have wick expansions for the two expressions appearing in the preceding
equation:

d(x) = xj

dj (x)wj (x), d

l (x) = xj

d
l;j (x)wj (x)

(3.2.6)

the numerical distributions appearing in these relations have the following properties: they are
poincare covariant, they have causal support and the order of singularity can be restricted according
to the power counting formula:

(dj ) + j  4, (d

l;j ) + j  4

(3.2.7)

according to the power counting theorem.

13

one can rewrite (3.2.6) as follows:

d(x) = xi

di(x)wi(x), d

l (x) = xi

di(x)w 

l;i(x) +xi

d
i (x)wl;i(x)

(3.2.8)

where di and d
i can be taken linear independent over the vector space of smooth functions with
polynomial bounded increase at innity om . the index i takes a nite number of values and the
expressions wi(x), wl;i(x), w 

l;i(x) are wick polynomials.

using the linear independence one obtains from (3.2.5) a set of identities among wick polynomials

of the type

where the left hand side can be computed as follows. first one makes the derivation operations in the
right hand side of (3.2.5). it is quite possible that relations of the type

dqwi =   

(3.2.9)


x
l

d
l;i(x) = xj

cjdj(x)

(3.2.10)

are valid for some numbers cj. then one has to rearrange the expression in the right hand side of
(3.2.5) and the right hand side of (3.2.9) emerges as the coecient of di(x).

identities of the type (3.2.10) are called ward-takahashi (or slavnov-taylor identities). in [12]
these relations are called the c-g identities. they have been extensively studied in [9]. in lower orders
of perturbation theory one can check them by explicit computation.

one now can interpret the renormalization theory as a distribution-splitting preserving of the ward
identities. suppose that one can nd a causal splitting di = dadv
of the set of causal distributions
di(x) such that we preserve poincare covariance, the order of singularity and the identities (3.2.10)
i.e. we also have:

i dret

i


x
l

(d
l;i)adv(ret)(x) = xj

cjdadv(ret)

j

(x)

(3.2.11)

then we dene the expressions a(x) and a

l (x) by making into the formul (3.2.8) the substi-

tutions d  dadv. if we use now the relations (3.2.9) we easily obtain

dqa(x) = i

n

xl=1


x
l

a

l (x),

|x| = n.

(3.2.12)

the similar property for the chronological products of order n easily follows. so, the obstructions
to the gauge invariance in order n can appear in the process of causally splitting the relations (3.2.10)
i.e. we might have instead of (3.2.11):


x
l

(d
l;i)adv(ret)(x) xj

cjdadv(ret)

j

(x) = p(x)

where the expression in the right hand side p(x) - called anomaly - must have the form

here p() is a lorentz covariant polynomial in the partial derivative operators and

p(x) = p()(x);

(x)  (x1  xn)    (xn1  xn).

14

(3.2.13)

(3.2.14)

(3.2.15)

also, if the distribution appearing in (3.2.10) have some global symmetry property (symmetry with
respect to some global group of symmetries, (anti)symmetry with respect to some indices, etc.) one
can usually perform the distribution splitting such that these properties are preserved also. moreover,
we have a limitation on the degree of the polynomial p():

deg(p)  

(3.2.16)

where  is the order of singularity of the left hand side of (3.2.13). it easily follows a case when there
are no anomalies, namely when: (d
. let us note in closing this section that the form
of a anomaly can be simplied by redenitions of the distributions ai and a
l;i; we have the freedom of
adding expressions of the type p()(x).

4.1 yang-mills coupled to matter

we follow [17] where the pure yang-mills case was studied emphasizing the possible appearance of
anomalies in a more explicit way.

theorem 4.1 suppose that the distribution t (x, y) veries (3.1.10). the it veries the formal adia-

(4.1.4)

(4.1.5)

(4.1.6)

here s... is the symmetrization operator in the indices which are explicitly exhibited.

proof: (i) according to the ideas from subsection 3.2, we compute the commutator

d(x1, x2)  [t (x1), t (x2)]

(4.1.7)

using wick theorem and identify a set of linearly independent distributions di as in (3.2.8); these
are distributions in one variable   x1  x2 due to translation invariance. direct inspection of the
expressions (2.1.14) and (2.2.1) produces the a list of such distributions  with causal support. using
feynman graph terminology we have distributions associated to tree and one, two and three loops
graphs. all these distributions can be written as sum of the positive (negative) frequency parts:

(a) from tree graphs:

 = (+) + ().

dm,

dm,
sm (x)  (i   + m )dm (x),

dm,

(4.1.8)

(4.1.9)

where dm is the pauli-villars commutator distribution of causal support corresponding to mass m
(see [17] for the denition) and sm is the similar distribution for a dirac eld of mass m .

(b) from one-loop graphs we get new distributions with causal support.

(4.1.10)

we note that in the denition of d()

m1,m2; we have taken the antisymmetric part in the masses
because the symmetric part has been considered separately :it is the third distribution from the list.

(4.1.11)

(4.1.12)

the distributions p ...

the distributions following from contractions of axial and a vectorial current are null because the

traces so obtained are null. next, we note that in the other commutators

m 5 = s()
m .

(4.1.13)

d

1 (x1, x2)  [t (x1), t (x2)], d

2 (x1, x2)  [t (x1), t (x2)] = d

1 (x2, x1)

(4.1.14)

the distributions gd

l;i from (3.2.8) can be of the following type:

dm,

sm , dm1,m2;, dm1,m2;, pm1,m2;, pm1,m2;

(4.1.15)

and the distributions of the type di can be of the type:

dm,

dm, dm1,m2, dm1m2;.

(4.1.16)

here the various parameters m, m, . . . are the masses appearing in the theory.

if we consider

distinct combinations of masses and indices we obtain a linear independent set of distributions.

let us also give for further use the orders of singularity of the distributions listed above. we have:

(dm) = 2, (dm1,m2) = 0, (dm1,m2;) = 1, (dm1,m2;) = 2, (pm1,m2) = 2,

(pm1,m2;) = 1, (pm1,m2;) = 2, (pm;m1,m2) = 4, (pm;m1,m2;) = 4,

(m,m ) = 1, (dm1,m2,m3) = 2, (dm1,m2;m3) = 4, (dm1,m2,m3,m4) = 4.

(4.1.17)

17

some of these orders of singularity are in fact lower than naive power counting suggests.
all these distributions have causal support so we have causal decompositions:

 = adv  ret

(4.1.18)

we have assumed that the causal splitting is preserving lorentz covariance and the order of
singularity. if the order of singularity is less 0 then this causal decomposition is a unique (see the end
of the preceding section). this is the case for the distributions dm, sm and dm1m2;.

(ii) now we consider the ward identities (3.2.10). by direct inspection one nds out that they are:

(2 + m2)dm = 0,


 m ) = 0,

(i    m )sm = sm (i
2  m2
2  m2

dm1,m2; = (m2
dm1,m2; = (m2
1)dm1,m2;
pm1,m2; = i(m1  m2)pm1,m2

1)dm1,m2,

pm1,m2; = i(m1  m2)pm1,m2;.

(4.1.19)

(4.1.20)

(4.1.21)

(4.1.22)

(4.1.23)

(4.1.24)

now we analyze possible anomalies resulting after the causal splitting procedure. it is well known
for the (unique)

that the rst two relations (4.1.19) and (4.1.20) are indeed producing anomalies:
causal splitting considered above one gets:

(2 + m2)dadv(ret)

m

= ,

(i    m )sadv(ret)

m

= sadv(ret)

m

(i


 m ) = i.

(4.1.25)

(4.1.26)

one can prove more than that: even if we modify these splitting with arbitrary local polynomial

terms the anomalies do not disappear.

next we consider (4.1.22); inspecting the orders of we can have the following generic form of the

anomaly:

we can eliminate this anomaly if we make the redenition:

p() = c1 + c3 2.

dadv

m1,m2;  dadv

m1,m2; + (c1g + c3).

(4.1.27)

(4.1.28)

the case (4.1.24) can be treated in a similar way and the anomaly is also eliminated. the ward
identity (4.1.21) is non-trivial only for m1 6= m2. we have already noticed that there exists a unique
causal decomposition preserving lorentz covariance and the order of singularity of dm1,m2;; then we
can dene:

dadv

m1,m2 =

dm1,m2;

(4.1.29)

1

m2

2  m2
1

and the relation (4.1.21) is preserved; moreover the order of singularity is preserved: (dadv
(dadv

m1,m2;) + 1 = 0.
the ward identity (4.1.23) is non-trivial only for m1 6= m2 and it has the generic form

m1,m2) =

p() = c0 + c22.

18

(4.1.30)

if we make the redenitions:

p adv
m1,m2;  p adv

m1,m2; + c2, p adv

m1,m2  p adv

m1,m2 + i

c0

m1  m2



(4.1.31)

the anomaly is eliminated.

it is interesting to summarize the preceding argument by saying that the anomalies are produced

only by the distributions associated to tree graphs.

(iii) it follows that we can describe the structure of the terms from d

l (x1, x2) which can produce
anomalies. it is sucient to consider l = 1 and notice that the other piece doubles the value of the
anomaly (because of obvious symmetry properties). we have:

d

(iv) we proceed now as in [17]. first we equate the expression a(x) to a coboundary dql(x).
we get all the relations from [17] (and this explains the rst four relations from the statement).

moreover we obtain for all a, b = 1, . . . , r:

[ta, tb] + [t

[ta, sb]  {t

(4.1.39)

which are equivalent to the last two relations from the statement.

(v) from the preceding computations we can obtain the explicit expression for the coboundary

l(x): it coincides with the expression obtained for the pure yang-mills case:

l(x) = ly m (x) 

d (x)a

(4.1.42)

again it coincides with the expression from the pure yang-mills case:

e (x) : f

we consider now a canonical causal splitting ac(x1, x2) and ac,

(4.1.43)
(x1, x2) given by the expressions
which are obtained from the corresponding commutators if we make the substitutions:   adv.
this indeed gives a causal splitting of d(x1, x2) and d
l (x1, x2) respectively. however the identity
(3.2.12) is not fullled. if we dene now the new causal splitting

l

a(x1, x2)  ac(x1, x2) + (x1  x2)l(x1), a

l (x1, x2)  ac,

l

(x1, x2) + (x1  x2)l(x1)

(4.1.44)

20

then one can see that (3.2.12) becomes true. moreover, in this way one can obtain in the usual way
the expression of the chronological products t (x1, x2) and t 
l (x1, x2) such that we have (3.2.4) and
all other properties, in particular symmetry. (cid:4)

remark 4.2 if we do not require that (3.1.10) is fullled, the relations (4.1.4) and (4.1.6) acquire a
weaker form.

the group-theoretical informations contained in this theorem are:
(a) the expressions fabc are the structure constants of a lie algebra g.
(b) the structure constants fabc corresponding to ma = mb = mc = 0 generate a lie subalgebra

g0  g.

(c) the r  r (antisymmetric) matrices ta,

a = 1, . . . , r dened according to

(ta)bc  f 

bca,

a, b, c = 1, . . . , r.

(4.1.45)

are an r-dimensional representation of the lie algebra g.

the representation ta exhibited in the statement of the theorem is nothing else but the represen-

tation of the gauge algebra g into which the higgs elds live.

(d) the relation (4.1.5) tells that the matrices t

relation (4.1.6) shows that the matrices s
representations t

b of the lie algebra g.

a are representations of the lie algebra g and
a are some tensor operators with respect to the couple of

so, we propose the following strategy of analyzing the generalization of the standard model de-
scribed in this paper: rst one should nd out restrictions on the lie algebra g from the relation
(4.1.2), then one takes a couple of representations t
a of this lie algebra and afterwards one determines
the matrices s+
a from the relation (4.1.6) using ideas from the proof of wigner-eckart theorem. we
mention that if one tries to substitute the formula (2.2.18) into the formula (4.1.6), as it is done in [3],
then we end up with some very complicated trilinear relations which are extremely dicult to analyze
in the general case.

next, we have a generalization of proposition 3.9 from [17]. by denition the feynman propagator

and the feynman antipropagator are:

f  adv  () = ret + (+), af  (+)  adv = ret  ().

(4.1.46)

then we have:

4.2 the conservation of the brst current

the expression

we want to investigate the conservation of this current in higher orders of perturbation theory.

(4.2.7)

is valid for the canonical chronological product.

we have the following result which can be interpreted as a conservation of the brst current in

the second order of perturbation theory:

theorem 4.6 there exists a nite renormalization such that one has the following conservation law:


x
1

t (j

brst (x1), t (x2)) = i(x1  x2)


x
1

t (x1)

proof: we start from the obvious relation


x
1

[(j

brst (x1), t (x2)] = 0

(4.2.8)

(4.2.9)

and perform the canonical causal splitting using the expression of the commutator derived above. if
we proceed in analogy to the derivation of the consistency conditions for the second order chronological
products we obtain:


x
1

t c(j

brst (x1), t (x2)) = i


x

[(x1  x2)n (x1)]  i(x1  x2)a(x1)

now it is a matter of computation to prove that we have: a = t . if we perform the nite
renormalization t (j
brst (x1), t (x2))  i(x1  x2)n (x1) then we obtain the
conclusion from the statement. (cid:4)

brst (x1), t (x2)) = t c(j

we remark that one can obtain from the preceding result the gauge invariance condition (2.1.11)

for n = 1 using the method of appendix b of [10].

5 third-order gauge invariance

5.1 the derivation of the anomaly

in this section we will analyze the possible obstructions to factorization of the s-matrix in the third
order of the perturbation theory. in principle, there is no dierence with respect to the preceding
section. nevertheless, the details of distribution splitting are considerably more complicated and the
same is true for the whole combinatorial argument.

first we rst give a standard regularization procedure of the distributions appearing in the lists
(4.1.9)-(4.1.12). we we choose m0 > 0 dierent from all masses of the model and write the pauli-villars
distribution for any mass as follows:

one can check that the order of singularity of dreg is

dm = dm0 + dreg;

(dreg) = 4.

(5.1.1)

(5.1.2)

the decomposition (5.1.1) induces a similar decomposition for all distributions in the lists (4.1.9)-

(4.1.12): we have a sum of two pieces:

 = 0 + reg

where

(0) = (), (reg) = ()  2

and the support properties of 0 in the momentum space are more convenient. we have:

0,()(p)  (p0)f (p2)

(5.1.3)

(5.1.4)

(5.1.5)

with supp(f )  {p2  2} for some parameter with mass signicance  > 0; (for the distributions
()(p) we can have in principle  = 0.)

the main result is contained in the following theorem:

theorem 5.1 suppose that the distribution t (x1, x2, x3) veries the condition (3.1.10). then it
verify the formal adiabatic limit condition if and only if, beside the conditions from the statement of
theorem 2.1, we also have the following set of supplementary conditions:

the distributions appearing in the analysis of the second order perturbation theory i.e the lists (4.1.9)-
(4.1.12). they appear with these three combinations of arguments from various wick contractions
in the preceding formul for the commutators. here the elds (x1), (x2), (x3)) are factors
in the wick monomials of t (x1),
t (x3) respectively. if fermi elds are present one has to
take into account the signs induced by the permutation of the non-commuting factors in dening the
associated distributions ().

t (x2),

we have to investigate the types of numerical distributions with causal support which can appear
from the computation of the four commutators. these distributions will depend only of two variables
1  x1  x3,
2  x2  x3 due to translation invariance. it convenient to use again a graph theory
terminology. we dene a super-line to be the assemble of lines of a feynman graph connecting two
vertices. then the notions of super-tree and super-loop are obvious and we have only such types of
graphs. we give the generic form of the distributions associated to them.

(a) first we obtain some distributions containing a factor  from commutators containing a factor

(x  y)l(x) or (x  y)l(x). in this case we obtain distributions of the type

d()(x1, x2; x3) = (x1  x2)(x2  x3)

(5.1.11)

and other permutations of the variables. here the distribution  is one from the lists (4.1.9)-(4.1.12).

(b) next, from super-tree graphs we obtain three types of distribution.
(b1) there exists a super-line between x1 and x3 and a super-line between x2 and x3. in this case

one obtains distributions of the form:

d(3)(x1, x2; x3) = (+)

1

(x2  x3)()
+f

(x3  x1)  ()
2 (x3  x1)1(x2  x3)  f

(x2  x3)(+)
(x3  x1)
1 (x2  x3)2(x3  x1)

2

1

2

(5.1.12)

the causal support of this type of distribution can be checked if one derives a alternative for-

mul. if:

dadv(ret)
(3)

(x1, x2; x3) = ret(adv)

2

(x3  x1)adv(ret)

1

(x2  x3)

then we have from (4.1.46):

d(3)(x1, x2; x3) = dadv

(3) (x1, x2; x3)  dret

(3)(x1, x2; x3).

(5.1.13)

(5.1.14)

moreover, if one uses the expression of the third-order chronological product (3.1.22) one can prove

that the distribution of this type is producing the feynman propagator

(3)(x1, x2; x3) = f
df

2 (x3  x1)f

1 (x2  x3)

(5.1.15)

26

(b2) there exists a super-line between x1 and x2 and a super-line between x1 and x3. in this case

one obtains distributions of the form:

d(1)(x1, x2; x3) = (+)

2

(x1  x2)  ()

2

(x3  x1)()
+af

3

3

(x1  x2)2(x3  x1)  f

(x3  x1)(+)
(x1  x2)
2 (x3  x1)3(x1  x2)

3

(5.1.16)

the causal support of this type of distribution can be also checked if one derives the alternative

formul. we dene:

dadv(ret)
(1)

(x1, x2; x3) = ret(adv)

3

(x1  x2)ret(adv)

1

(x3  x1)

and we have as before:

d(1)(x1, x2; x3) = dadv

(1) (x1, x2; x3)  dret

(1)(x1, x2; x3).

(5.1.17)

(5.1.18)

if one uses the expression of the third-order chronological product (3.1.22) one can prove that the

distribution of this type is producing the feynman propagator

df
(1)(x1, x2; x3) = f

3 (x1  x2)f

2 (x3  x1)

(5.1.19)

(b3) there exists a super-line between x1 and x2 and a super-line between x2 and x3. in this case

one obtains distributions d(2)(x1, x2; x3) of the same form as in case (b2) if one makes x1  x2.

we will denote the distributions associated to super-tree graphs by d(i)(, )(x1, x2; x3) indi-
cating explicitly the distributions in one variable ,  from the lists (4.1.9)-(4.1.12) involved in
the construction. one can verify that if the orders of singularity of these distributions are  and 
respectively, then:

(d(i)(, )) = 4 +  + .

(5.1.20)

(c) we consider now graphs with a purely bosonic super-loop. one obtains the following type of

distribution;

d(123)(x1, x2; x3) = af

we denote suggestively this type of distributions by d(123)(1, 2, 3)(x1, x2; x3) where i,

i =
1, 2, 3 are distributions from the lists (4.1.9)-(4.1.12) and we have concerning the order of singularity:

(d(123)(1, 2, 3)) = 4 +xi

(i).

(5.1.23)

we say now something about the generic momentum space structure of such a distribution. first
one has to obtain from the explicit formul for the distributions  in one variable that in all cases:

()

i

(p)  (p0)fi(p2)

(5.1.24)

with supp(fi)  {p2  2
i = 1, 2, 3. we
consider now the taylor transform of (123)(1, 2) and we use the notation k  k1 + k2; the generic
structure is:

i } for some parameters with mass signicance i  0,

(123)(k1, k2) = (k2

1  (2 + 3)2)g1 + (k2

2  (3 + 1)2)g2 + (k 2  (1 + 2)2)g3.

(5.1.25)

it follows that if at least two of the masses i  0,

i = 1, 2, 3 are strictly positive, then (0, 0) 6
supp( (123)(k1, k2). this observation is useful because for causal distributions with such support
property in momentum space one can use the so-called central formula for causal decomposition of
distributions [23]. if the conditions of validity of the central formula are not meet we will have to use
a regularization procedure.

(ii) we investigate the possible ward identities and obstructions to causal splitting. first we

consider the case (b). we illustrate this case on the the distribution

d  d(3)(dm, )

(5.1.26)

where  is arbitrary. the other cases can be treated similarly. first we derive the ward identity:

d = (x1  x3)(x2  x3) + m2df

m(x1  x3)(x2  x3).

(5.1.27)

using the formula for the causal splitting (5.1.13) one can see that the preceding identity is

preserved by the operation of distribution splitting.

next, we consider case (c). we have to study separately the case when the super-loop contains at
most one dirac line and the case when we have three dirac lines. we illustrate the rst case one the
distribution

the other cases can be treated similarly. the ward identity is in this case:

d = d(123)(dm1 , dm2, dm3 ), m1 > 0;

d = (x2  x3)dm2,m3(x3  x1) +   

(5.1.28)

(5.1.29)

where by . . . we mean contributions with the order of singularity strictly smaller than 0. one computes
immediately that both hand sides have the order of singularity equal to 1. if we have m2 + m3 > 0
then we can apply the central decomposition formula and obtain no anomaly. in the opposite case,
we use standard regularization procedure (5.1.1) of the distributions appearing in the lists (4.1.9)-
(4.1.12) presented at the beginning of this subsection. the decomposition (5.1.1) induces a similar
decomposition for the distributions of the type d(i):

d(i) = d0

(i) + dreg

28

(5.1.30)

where

(d0) = (d), (dreg) = (d)  2

(5.1.31)

and the support properties of d0 in the momentum space are more convenient: (0, 0) 6 supp( d0

if we apply this decomposition to the distributions d and d we get two ward identities, one for
each piece. the rst one can be split causally without anomalies using the central decomposition
formula. for the second identity we note that both hand sides have order of singularity strictly lower
than 1 so this relation can be also split causally without anomalies as explained at the end of section
3. in this way we can obtain a anomaly-free decomposition of the ward identity we have started with.
one has to check case by case this argument for all the other types of distributions of type (c) without
dirac loops.

(i)).

a very important observation is that the preceding argument is not valid for distributions associ-
ated to super-loops containing three dirac lines. the reason is that one is lead to the computation of
some traces. to be more specic the relevant terms from the rst commutator (5.1.9) are:

d

1 (x1, x2; x3) = d

+d

abc (x1, x2; x3) : ua(x1)ab (x2)ac(x3) :
abc(x1, x2; x3) : ua(x1)b(x2)ac(x3) : +(x2  x3)
abc(x1, x2; x3) : ua(x1)b(x2)c(x3) :
a (x1, x2; x3)ua(x1) +   

+d

+d

(5.1.32)

where by    we mean the terms which cannot produce anomalies. let us note that all these terms
are obtain from wick contractions of the pieces of the interaction lagrangian of the type (2.2.7).

the distributions appearing in this formula are sums of distributions of the type d(123) because of
the traces. but in this case, the trace operation can annihilate the most singular term and instead of
(5.1.23) we might have:

(d) < 4 +xi

(i).

(5.1.33)

it follows that these distributions must be studied separately and some explicit computation are

required.

(iii) all the distributions appearing in the formula (5.1.32) have 8 contributions corresponding to
the decomposition of the three currents involved in (2.2.7) into the vectorial and axial components. if
we compute the contribution corresponding to three vectorial factors, then the others can be obtained
by simple substitutions. let us consider this pure vector contribution to d
abc (x1, x2; x3); the explicit
expression is:

abc;v v v = (ta)ab(tb)bc (tc)cad(v )
d

mc ,ma,mb

+ (ta)ab(tc)bc (tb)cad(v )

(5.1.34)

where we have dened for arbitrary masses m1, m2, m3 the following fundamental distribution:

m2(x3  x1)hs()

m1 (x3  x1)i 
m3 (x1  x2)i 
m1 (x2  x3)i } (5.1.35)

which is similar to (5.1.21); compare also to formula (5.3.11) from [23]. it also has causal support:
one can obtain quite easily alternative expressions having the structure (5.1.22).

29

the entire vectorial contribution is now obtained if we add the contributions following from

d
abc;v v v if we perform the following simple transforms:

ta  t
a,

tb  t

  5,

   5,

(5.1.36)

and the other two similar possibilities. using the formula (4.1.13) we obtain the following form for
the pure vectorial part:

abc;v = (ta)ab(tb)bc (tc)cad(v )

(5.1.37)

one notices that the vectorial part of d

abc is express only in terms of the distribution of the type

d(v )
m1,m2,m3.

by similar transforms one can obtain the pure axial part. one has in denes in analogy to (5.1.34)

the distribution d(a)

m1,m2,m3 by inserting a factor 5:

d(a)
m1,m2,m3(x1, x2; x3) = t r5 {  }

(5.1.38)

where by {  } we mean the same paranthesis as in (5.1.35). the pure axial contribution to d
abc is
similar to (5.1.37). the only relevant thing is that it is expressed only in terms of the new distribution
d(a)
m1,m2,m3. so, it follows that the distribution d
abc can be expressed in terms of two independent
distributions: d(v )
m1,m2,m3. one can prove quite easily that the order of singularities are

m1,m2,m3 and d(a)

let us note in passing that the asymptotic behaviour of the distribution

(d(v )(a)

m1,m2,m3) = 1.

d
abc = d

abc;v + d

abc;a

is given by:

abc  vabcd

(5.1.39)

(5.1.40)

(5.1.41)

where the axial tensor aabc is given by the expression (1.0.1) from the introduction, the vector tensor
is given by a similar expression:

and

(5.1.42)

(5.1.43)

a similar investigation can be performed for the other distributions appearing in the formula

(5.1.32). the distribution d
and d(a)

m1,m2,m3 which can be obtained from d(v )

m1,m2,m3 and d(a)

abc can be expressed in terms of two independent distributions: d(v )

m1,m2,m3
m1,m2,m3 making   1. the order of

30

singularity of these distributions is lower than naive power counting indicates. they can be written
as follows:

d(v )(a)
m1,m2,m3 =

mid(v )(a)

i

3

xi=1

with

(d(v )(a)

i

) = 0.

(5.1.44)

(5.1.45)

analogously, the distribution d

m1,m2,m3 which can be obtained from d(v )

abc can be expressed in terms of two independent distributions:
m1,m2,m3 making   1. we

m1,m2,m3 and d(a)

m1,m2,m3 and d(a)
d(v )
also have:

(d(v )(a)

m1,m2,m3) = 1.

(5.1.46)

finally, the distribution d

a can be expressed in terms of two independent distributions: d(v )

m;m1,m2,m3 which can be obtained from d(v )

m1,m2,m3 and d(a)

and d(a)
have in this case:

m;m1,m2,m3
m1,m2,m3 by making sm1  m,m1. we

(d(v )(a)

m;m1,m2,m3) = 3.

(5.1.47)

we also need the distributions d(v )

m1,m2,m3 and d(v )

m;m1,m2,m3 which can be obtained from d(v )

m1,m2,m3

m;m1,m2,m3 respectively by making   1. in this case we have a structure similar to (5.1.44)

and d(v )
and a similar result for the order of singularity.
we can easily see that all distributions d...(a)

are completely antisymmetric in the lorentz indices
due to traces involving a 5. matrix. it is not dicult to prove that one can impose a supplementary
condition on the causal splitting procedure, namely the preservation of this symmetry property.

...

the distributions appearing into the third commutator from (5.1.9) can be obtained from the
preceding ones by making the substitution x1  x2 and this doubles the value of the possible anomalies
coming from the rst commutator.

the distributions appearing in to second commutator from (5.1.9) can be obtained from the pre-
ceding ones by more subtle transforms. for the case (b) and the case (c) without dirac loops we have
the same list of distributions and there are no anomalies. for the case (c) with dirac loops we have
to consider:

m1,m2,m3(x1, x2; x3)  f 
d
d
m1,m2,m3(x1, x2; x3)  f 

m2,m3,m1(x1, x2; x3)  d

(5.1.59)

(5.1.60)

the causal splitting of these two type of ward identities is sensibly dierent. let us rst consider
only the rst six equations (the vectorial ward identities). because of the delta terms in the right
hand sides, we have the same order of singularity for both sides in all vectorial ward identities , if the
conditions of application of the central splitting formula are meet we get no anomalies. if some of the
masses are null, one has to use a regularization procedure like for the case (b). more precisely one
can prove that the decomposition (5.1.1) induces a similar decomposition for the distributions of the
type d(123):

d(123) = d0

(123) + dreg

(123)

where

(d0

(123)) = (d(123)), (dreg

(123)) = (d(123))  4

32

(5.1.61)

(5.1.62)

and the support properties of d0

(123) in the momentum space are more convenient: (0, 0) 6 supp( d0

(123)).
we turn now to the last six equations (the axial ward identities). the previous argument is still
valid for the last two of them. we consider some generic anomalies p 
3 obtained after the causal
splitting of the identities (5.1.57) and (5.1.58). if we dierentiate the corresponding equations with
respect to x

1 respectively, we obtain the consistency equations

3 and x

1 , p 


x

p 

1 = 0,


x

p 

3 = 0

and this leads to p 

i = 0,

i = 1, 3.

the ward identities (5.1.55) and (5.1.56) can produce anomalies of the type

p (x) = const

(5.1.63)

(5.1.64)

for some positive constant const. the explicit expression of this constant can be computed as in [23]

resulting anomaly is then:

a(x) = const. aabc

this axial anomaly in the following form:

aabbj (x) = const. aabc(x) : ua(x1)f 

b (x1)f 

c (x3) :

(5.1.67)

and we can also show that the tensor depending only on the group indices aabc is in fact given by the
formula (1.0.1) from the introduction. the anomaly aabbj is a cocycle

dqaabbj = 0

(5.1.68)

but it is not a coboundary; so disappears i we have the condition aabc = 0 i.e.
condition (5.1.6) from the statement.

the well-known

(v) we still have to investigate the possible anomalies coming from the delta terms i.e from distri-
butions associated to graphs of type (a). we present here briey the analysis of these terms. one can
compute the commutators and select the terms which will lead, in principle, to an anomaly. we get:

[17] we get from this commutator a possible anomaly:

a(x1, x2, x3) = (x) [a1(x1) + a2(x1) + a3(x1) + a4(x1)]

the results are:

 in [11] it is proved that the a1 = 0 due to the jacobi identity.

 one can also show, using the identity (2.1.19) that a2 + a3 = 0.

 if we try to write the anomaly a4 as a coboundary dql(x) we should take

l(x) = g

acf gh : a(x)c(x)f (x)g(x)h(x) :

(5.1.75)

which is forbidden by the assumption that (3.1.10) is fullled.

so we get the second restriction from the statement. (cid:4)

remark 5.2 recently [19] a new method was proposed to solve problems of consistency as the ones
appearing in our paper.
instead of imposing a factorisation condition of the type (2.1.10) (or its
innitesimal version (2.1.11)) one imposes a quantum analogue of the noether conservation law of
a certain current. presumably, this starting points are equivalent and they should lead to the same sets
of consistency conditions. this point deserves further investigations. however, one should compare
carefully the relation (4.2.8) expressing the conservation law of the brst current (and equivalent
to the formal adiabatic limit condition) to the relation (4.5) of [19] expression the quantum noether
postulate.

5.2 the standard model

we remind the notations from [17]. the lie algebra is in this case su(2)  u(1) and the standard basis
xa,

a = 0, 1, 2, 3 has the usual commutation relations

remark 5.4 in [24] a dual point of view is followed: one gives the masses of the heavy bosons
m1 = m2 6= m3 and determines that the gauge algebra must be su(2)  u(1).

we consider the minimal standard model containing only one generation of dirac particles. in this

case one takes in the generic formalism from the preceding section: n = 2 and

m  (cid:18) 0

0 me(cid:19) .

0

(5.2.8)

the components 2 (resp. 1) correspond to the electron (resp. the electronic neutrino) and me

is the electron mass. remark that the neutrino mass is considered null.

the choice for the representations t

a is the following one:

t+
1 =

1
2

t+
2 =

and

g2,

g1,

t+

2 (cid:0)gcos 3 + gsin 1(cid:1) ,
2 (cid:0)gsin 3 + gcos 1(cid:1)

t+
0 = 

t+
1 = t+

2 = 0,

t+
3 = y sin ,

t+
0 = y cos ;

(5.2.9)

(5.2.10)

here i are the pauli matrices. the representation property (4.1.5) is fullled for any matrix y.
however, we have the following elementary result:

proposition 5.5 the interaction between the dirac eld of the electron 2 and the electromagnetic
eld a

0 has the usual form

e : 22 : a
0

(here e is the electron charge) i

and

next, we have

g =

e

sin 

,

g = 

e

cos 

y =

g(1  3) =

proposition 5.6 the expressions for the matrices s+

a are:

s+
0 =

me

2m1 (cid:18) 0

0

0

1(cid:19) ,

s+
1 =

s+

2m1 (cid:18) 0

(5.2.11)

(5.2.12)

(5.2.13)

0

0(cid:19) ,

s+
3 =

ime

2m1 (cid:18) 0

proof:
one uses the relations (2.2.18) for a = 1, 2, 3 and obtains the expressions for s+
a ,

a = 1, 2, 3.

next, we use the relation (4.1.6), more precisely:

a s+
t

0  s+

0 t+

a = if 

0cas+
c ,

a = 1, 2, 3.

(5.2.14)

this equation gives immediately the expression for s+
the expression of the higgs potential is obtained as in [13], [4]. one can check that in this way

0 . (cid:4)

the usual standard model is obtained.

5.3 regularization and anomalies

we have succeeded to give a complete analysis of the possible anomalies appearing in the standard
model up to the order three of the perturbation theory. one would want to generalise this analysis to
all orders of the perturbation theory. it is possible that one can use the same type of combinatorial
argument, namely one considers possible distributions appearing in the commutators d(x) of order n
and observes that only the super-loop graphs with dirac lines can produce anomalies. then it is quite
possible that in higher orders the orders of singularity are suciently lower to make possible a causal
splitting of the ward identities without anomalies. this seems to be indicated by the traditional
argument from the literature [1], [2], [25].
