abstract

we consider the non-interacting massive wess-zumino model in four-dimensional
anti-de sitter space and show that the conformal dimensions of the corresponding
boundary elds satisfy the relations expected from superconformal invariance. in some
cases the irregular mode must be used for one of the scalar elds.

1 introduction

the ads/cft correspondence, originally conjectured by maldacena [1] formulates a duality
between a eld theory on anti-de sitter space (ads) and a conformal eld theory (cft) on
its boundary. the most noted example is the duality between ads type iib string theory
and n = 4 super yang-mills theory [2]. the precise form of the ads/cft correspondence
[3, 4] in classical approximation reads

exp (iads[]) = (cid:28)exp(cid:18)z ddx0(x)o(x)(cid:19)(cid:29) .

on the ads side, the function 0 represents the boundary value of the eld , whereas
on the cft side it couples as a current to the conformal eld operator o. there is a
characteristic relation between the mass of the ads eld  and the conformal dimension
of the cft eld o [5]. this has been investigated for scalar [4, 6, 7], spinor [8, 9], vector
[7, 9, 10], graviton [11, 12, 13] and rarita-schwinger elds [14, 15, 16]. supersymmetry and
supergravity in the ads/cft context have been considered in [17, 18, 19, 5, 20, 21, 22, 23,
24, 25].

for ads supersymmetric eld theories, supersymmetry relates the masses of elds in
the same multiplet with each other. hence, the ads/cft correspondence predicts that the
conformal dimensions of the corresponding boundary cft operators satisfy specic rela-
tions. on the other hand, superconformal symmetry imposes a condition on the conformal

dimensions of the primary elds of a superconformal multiplet. one would expect that the
ads prediction coincides with the cft condition, which would mean that the ads/cft
correspondence couples an ads super multiplet to a superconformal multiplet on the ads
boundary. however, to the best of our knowledge, no direct comparison has yet been made.
in this paper, we shall tackle this problem by looking at the non-interacting massive
wess-zumino model in ads4, nding the relations between the conformal dimensions of the
corresponding scalar and spinor boundary operators and comparing them with the relations
expected from superconformal invariance. we shall nd in agreement with the classic ads
papers [26, 27] that in some cases one must use the irregular mode for one of the ads scalar
elds in order for the ads/cft correspondence to hold true. this modies the standard
prescription [4], which uses only the regular modes.

let us start with some preliminaries and use them to explain our notation. for simplicity,
we shall consider ads4 with euclidean signature. as is well known [28], it can be constructed
as a hyperboloid embedded into a ve-dimensional minkowski space with a metric tensor
ab (a, b = 1, 0, 1, 2, 3), where

(,  = 0, 1, 2, 3). then, ads4 can be dened by the embedding

11 = 1,

 = ,

and 1 = 0

yaybab = 1,

y1 > 0,

(1)

(2)

where the radius of the hyperboloid has been chosen equal to 1 for simplicity. the metric

ds2 = dyadybab

(3)

represents the ads metric, if one takes the y as ads4 coordinates and denes y1 via
equation (2).

while the representation (2) proves useful for nding the ads symmetries, a change of
variables will reveal the conformal symmetry of the ads boundary. introducing the variables
x by

x0 =

1

y0 + y1 ,

xi = x0yi

(i = 1, 2, 3),

(4)

yields a representation of ads4 as the upper half space 0 < x0 < , xi  r with the metric
(5)

ds2 =


(x0)2 dxdx.

the use of the minkowski ve-space suggests the introduction of 4  4 gamma matrices
a satisfying {a, b} = 2ab. the spin matrices of the corresponding lorentz algebra in
ve dimensions are sab = 1
4[a, b]. the gamma matrices of the four-dimensional euclidean
lorentz frame of ads4 are given by

a = a1

(6)

satisfying {a, b} = 2ab, (a, b = 0, 1, 2, 3). the corresponding spin matrices are sab =
4[a, b]. covariant gamma matrices are dened by  = ea
a and covariant spin matrices
by  = ea

eb

sab.

finally, let us give a short outline of the rest of the paper. the ads4 symmetry algebra
and its n = 1 grading will be derived in section 2. in section 3 we recast these algebras
in the form of conformal and superconformal algebras and recall the relations between the
conformal weights of the primary elds in a superconformal multiplet. the ads4 superspace
is constructed in section 4. in section 5 we consider the wess-zumino model in ads4 and
calculate the conformal dimensions of the corresponding boundary elds. we refer our read-
ers to the appendices a and b for information on grassmann variables and the calculation
of killing spinors, respectively.

2 symmetry algebra and its n = 1 grading

the ads symmetries are easiest found considering the embedding (2). in fact, equation (2)
is invariant under lorentz transformations of the minkowski ve-space, which are of the form
(y)a = ra
1 > 0. for the purposes of
this paper we consider only the connected subgroup of such matrices, namely the lie group
so(4, 1). an innitesimal transformation, r = 1 + m, has the form

byb, where the matrix r satises rt r =  and r1

where the generators (mcd)a

algebra and satisfy the commutation relations

ya = m a

b = a

byb =

cd(mcd)a

byb,

dbc form the standard basis of the so(4, 1)

(7)

[mab, mcd] = admbc + bcmad  acmbd  bdmac.

(8)

one can show from the equations (4) and (7) that the innitesimal change of the coor-

dinates x is given by

x0 = x0( + 2aixi),
xi = xi( + 2ajxj) + aix2  bi + ijxj,

(9)

where x2 = xx and where the parameters ai, bi and  are dened by

ai =

1

2 (cid:0)0i + 1i(cid:1) ,

bi =

1

2 (cid:0)0i  1i(cid:1)

and  = 10,

(10)

respectively. obviously, the transformations (9) reduce to innitesimal conformal transfor-
mations on the boundary, x0 = 0.

it is straightforward to nd the (complex) n = 1 grading of the so(4, 1) algebra (8).
first, introduce the fermionic generators q ( = 1, 2, 3, 4), which transform as so(4, 1)
spinors, i.e.

then, the superalgebra closes with the anti-commutator (see appendix a for notation)

[mab, q] = ( sab)

q.

(cid:8)q, q(cid:9) = 2( sab c 1)mab.

(11)

(12)

we would like to add two remarks at this point. first, the validity of equation (12) is
conditional upon the fact that we grade the ve-dimensional minkowski algebra. for higher
dimensions (e.g. ads5) one would have to introduce additional bosonic operators to obtain
closure of all jacobi identities [29]. second, the equations (8), (11) and (12) dene the
complex superalgebra b(0/2), whose real form is osp(1, 4) [30]. unfortunately, osp(1, 4)
does not contain so(4, 1) in its even part, which means in other words that no majorana
spinors exist for our minkowski ve-space. however, osp(1, 4) contains so(3, 2), which is the
symmetry group of ads4 with minkowski signature. resorting to a wick rotation at the
end to make our results valid, we shall ignore this fact and formally carry out the analysis.

3 conformal and superconformal algebra

as mentioned in section 2, the ads symmetry group acts as the conformal group on the ads
boundary. in this section, we shall for completeness explicitely show the isomorphisms be-
tween the d = 3 conformal algebra and so(4, 1) as well as between their n = 1 superalgebras.
let us introduce the conformal basis of so(4, 1) by dening

d = m10,
lij = mij,

ki = m0i + m1i,
pi = m0i  m1i.

then, an element m  so(4, 1) takes the form

m =

1
2

abmab = d + aiki + bipi +

1
2

ijlij,

(13)

(14)

with the parameters ai, bi and  given by equation (10). one easily nds from equation (13)
the commutation relations of d, pi, ki and lij, which are given by

[d, pi] = pi,
[d, ki] = ki,
[lij, pk] = jkpi  ikpj,
[lij, kk] = jkki  ikkj,
[pi, kj] = 2 (ijd  lij) ,
[lij, lkl] = illjk + jklil  ikljl  jllik,
[pi, pj] = [ki, kj] = [d, lij] = 0.

(15)

equations (15) are the standard representation of the conformal algebra [31].

the n = 1 grading of the conformal algebra (15) is well known in the literature [29],
but again, a direct comparison with the superalgebra given in section 2 seems useful. this
is done by choosing a particular representation of the ve-dimensional cliord algebra of
matrices a. choosing

i = (cid:18)i

0

0 i(cid:19) ,

1 = (cid:18) 0

1

1 0(cid:19) ,

(16)

1 0(cid:19) ,
0 = (cid:18)0 1

4

where i are the pauli spin matrices and 1 is the 2 2 unit matrix, one easily nds from the
denition (13) the spinor representations of the conformal basis elements, which are

0

splitting the spinor operator q into two 2-component spinors,

we nd from equation (11) the commutators

[pi, s] = (iq),
[ki, s] = 0.

(17)

(18)

furthermore, the charge conjugation matrix c has the form

c = (cid:18)0 c

c 0(cid:19) ,

where c is the charge conjugation matrix in three dimensions. hence, using the identity

sabmab = 2 s(d)d + s(ki)pi + s(pi)ki + s(lij)lij,

equations (12) and (17) yield the anticommutators

(19)

(20)

{q, q} = 2(cid:0)ic1(cid:1) pi,
{s, s} = 2(cid:0)ic1(cid:1) ki,
{q, s} = (cid:0)2c1d  ijlij(cid:1) .

equations (15), (18) and (20) form the n = 1 superconformal algebra in three dimensions
[29].
obviously, the operators lij, pi and q form the three-dimensional n = 1 poincare
superalgebra. let us therefore consider a scalar super-poincare multiplet consisting of the
scalar elds o and f and the spinor eld , which satisfy the supersymmetry relation

qo = ,
q = (ic1)io + (c1)f ,
qf = (ii).

5

(21)

imposing conformal symmetry on the multiplet means that the scaling dimensions of the
elds must satisfy

o =  +

1
2

= f + 1.

(22)

this relation is obtained by acting with the commutator [d, q] on the elds o and . notice
that the spinor operator s is expressed in terms of ki and q and thus does not introduce
new elds into the multiplet.

4 construction of ads superspace

in order to obtain the (n = 1) supersymmetric extension of ads4, one rst introduces
grassmann coordinates  in addition to the ads coordinates x. then one postulates that
the symmetry algebra of the superspace is given by the graded lie algebra constructed in
section 2. because the symmetry algebra determines innitesimal coordinate transforma-
tions, one can determine the latter from the knowledge of the algebra. the method to be
used has been described by zumino [32] and applies to any group g with a subgroup h.

in the case at hand, an element g  g is uniquely represented by

g = e

qh(x),

(23)

where  is some grassmann coordinate spinor, whose relation with  will be dened later
and h(x)  h = so(4, 1) is a lie-algebra valued function of the coordinates x. then, by
virtue of the group axioms, one can write

g0g = g = e

 qh(x)

(24)

and consider the transformations     and x  x as induced by the group element g0.
we shall in the following use the abbreviations  = q and m = 1
2abmab. in the case of
g0  h, i.e. an even transformation, equation (24) takes the form em eh(x) = eem h(x),
where m  and  are determined by the baker-campbell-hausdor formula. for innitesimal
m one nds m  = m and  =  + [m, ]. by denition, the even part em h(x) = h(x)
yields equation (9) and thus does not contain new information, whereas the odd part yields
a linear transformation of the grassmann coordinates, namely

  =

1
2

ab( sab)



.

on the other hand, for g0 = er with the abbreviation r = q, one writes

then, for innitesimal r one nds [32]

ereh(x) = e

em h(x).

(35)

thus, the supersymmetry transformation x is given by equation (9) using the parame-
ters of equation (35). although this solves the problem of nding the superspace transforma-
tions, a space-time covariant formulation would be much more desirable. such a formulation
involves the killing spinors, which are calculated in appendix b. in fact, it is easy to show
from equation (b.6) that the quantity 1  is a killing vector. on the other hand,
because also x is a killing vector and is linear in , it must have exactly this form with 
being a function of  only. a direct comparison using equations (9), (35), (b.3), (b.4) and
(b.6) shows that

x = (cid:18)1 +

1
2

 (cid:19) 1 .

(36)

equations (33) and (36) represent the supersymmetry transformation of the ads superspace
in a space-time covariant form. it is with this form that one can hope to eectively carry
out the calculations involving superelds. moreover, it will allow our formal results to be
carried over to the lorentzian signature case, where majorana spinors exist. notice that
x in equation (36) is generically complex for euclidean signature, because no majorana
spinors exist in this case.

let us conclude this section by nding the invariant integral measure for integration

over the ads4 superspace. first, we observe that the bosonic part d4xpg(x) = d4x(x0)4
is in itself invariant under any variable transformation, i.e. also under the supersymmetry
transformation (36). for the fermionic part of the integral measure, let us make the ansatz
d4 () and demand that it be invariant under the transformation    =  +  , where
  is given by equation (33). from equation (33) follows that
d4  = d4 h1  2(cid:16)1 +  (cid:17) i .

(37)

multiplying equation (37) with () and expanding to terms linear in  we nd the equation

(cid:20)1    

1
2

( )2(cid:21) 
 

 = 2(1 +  ),

whose solution up to a multiplicative constant is

() = 1 +   +

( )2.

3
2

(38)

it is straightforward to show that d4 () is also invariant under the bosonic transformation
(32). hence, the expression

d4xpg(x) d4 (cid:20)1 +   +

3
2

( )2(cid:21)

(39)

is the invariant superspace integration measure.

5 the wess-zumino model

let us start this section with the expansion of a chiral supereld in powers of the grassmann
variables  in order to identify its scalar and spinor eld contents. because of the existence
of previous work [33, 34, 26, 27] only the results will be given. however, it should be
noted that our derivation diers in some points from [33, 34]. keck [33] coupled a spinor
eld directly to the so(4, 1) spinor variable  of section 4, thereby demanding that the
spinor eld too be an so(4, 1) instead of a lorentz spinor. on the other hand, ivanov and
sorin [34] considered the killing spinor  (see appendix b) as the independent grassmann
variable, which can directly be coupled to a lorentz spinor eld. however, the complicated
transformation rule for  under supersymmetry transformations is a minor drawback of their
very complete formulation, which led us to consider the so(4, 1) spinor  as the independent
superspace variable and realize the coupling to lorentz spinor elds via a matrix (x), which
is calculated in appendix b. we feel that this treatment combines the nice features of both
references, [33] and [34]. in addition, it yields the killing spinor  as a side product.

the wess-zumino multiplet is given by the scalar elds a, b, f and g and the dirac
spinor eld . their supersymmtry transformations are easiest found by considering chiral
superelds. therefore, let us dene

a = al + ar,
f = fl + fr,

b = al  ar,
g = fl  fr,

and let us introduce the chiral projection operators

l =

1
2

(1  i1) and r =

1
2

(1 + i1).

then, the left and right handed chiral superelds are given by

(40)

(41)

( )2ddal,

(42)

(43)

respectively. it is straightforward to show using the transformation rules (33) and (36) that
the supersymmetry transformations of the left handed supereld components are given by

al = l,
(l) = 2l(/dal + fl),

(44)

fl = l  /dl,
where we introduced the killing spinor  = ().
it takes somewhat more eort to
show that all terms in the expansion (42) transform correctly. to nd the supersymmetry
transformations of ar, fr and r, simply replace l with r in equation (44).

9

for the wess-zumino model we also introduce conjugate superelds by dening

r = al + r  + (r) fl +    ,
l = ar + l  + (l) fr +    ,

(45)

where we used the killing spinor  = () and where the dots indicate terms similar to
those in equations (42) and (43).

a manifestly supersymmetric action is then given by the expression

s = z d4xpg(x) d4 ()(cid:2) lr + rl  m(cid:0) ll + rr(cid:1)(cid:3) ,

(46)

which describes the non-interacting wess-zumino model with a mass term. after inserting
the integration measure (38) we can perform the berezin integration and re-express the result
in terms of the elds a, b, f and g. hence, we obtain (up to a multiplicative constant and
surface terms, which have been dropped)

sbulk = z d4xg(cid:20)1

(cid:18)/d 

/d(cid:19)  + d ada + d bdb
 3 aa  3 bb  a f  af  b g  bg  f f  gg
 m(cid:0)   3 aa + 3 bb  a f  af + b g + bg(cid:1)(cid:21) .

solving the equations of motion for the auxilliary elds f and g gives

f = (m  1)a and g = (m + 1)b.

(47)

(48)

similar relations hold for f and g. substituting equation (48) back into the action (47)
yields the on-shell supersymmetric action [26, 27]

sbulk = z d4xg(cid:20)1

(cid:18)/d 

/d(cid:19)   m 
+ d ada + (m2 + m  2) aa
+ d bdb + (m2  m  2) bb(cid:21) .

(49)

the mass parameter m describes the mass of the fermion . moreover, for m = 0 the scalar
elds a and b are conformally coupled. the bulk action sbulk has to be accompanied for the
ads/cft correspondence by a surface term derivable from the variational principle [35].

it seems straightforward to read o from equation (49) the conformal dimensions of the
boundary operators coupling to the boundary values of a, b and . however, care must
be taken when specifying boundary conditions. according to [26, 27], because the elds a,
b and  are to form an irreducible representation of osp(1, 4) (for minkowski signature),
one must use the irregular mode for one of the scalar elds, if |m| < 1
2. therefore, let us
not exclude the irregular modes for the scalar elds. then the conformal dimensions of the

10

boundary operators are given by [4, 6, 9]

a =

(50)

where the plus and minus signs correspond to using the regular and irregular modes, respec-
tively. let us consider the case m  0. for m < 0 only the roles of a and b interchange.
comparing the values (50) with equation (22) we can identify the boundary elds corre-
sponding to the ads elds a, b, and  with the primary conformal elds o, f and ,
respectively. moreover, if m < 1
2, the irregular mode must be used for b in order to make
this identication.

in conclusion, we found for a simple example that the ads/cft correspondence relates
elds of ads supersymmetry multiplets to the primary elds of superconformal multiplets.
this fact was derived by explicitly constructing the ads supersymmetric model and com-
paring its predictions with the relations expected from super cft. in some cases, irreg-
ular modes must be considered for ads elds, changing the standard prescription of the
ads/cft correspondence. this conclusion stems from both, a pure ads point of view and
the ads/cft correspondence. we feel that a more general treatment should be attempted
in future work.

a spinor grassmann variables

this appendix summarizes our notations and useful formulae for grassmannian spinor vari-
ables in ve dimensions. we shall concentrate on facts which do not depend on the signature
of the ve-dimensional metric, thus avoiding explicit matrix representations and the intro-
duction of complex conjugate spinors. most of the following is derived from information on
cliord algebras and their representations, which can be found in [30].

a spinor  has components  ( = 1, 2, 3, 4), which are grassmannian variables, i.e. the

components of any two spinors  and  satisfy

spinor matrices usually carry an upper and a lower index, such as 
 etc. how-
ever, indices can be lowered and raised with the charge conjugation matrix and its inverse,

n, o = 0.

(a.2)

for d = 5 the charge conjugation matrix is anti-symmetric. one can now dene the scalar
product of two spinors by

  =   =   = .

(a.3)

the vector space of 4  4 matrices with only lower indices is spanned by 16 matrices,
which can conveniently be chosen to be i) the anti-symmetric charge conjugation matrix c,
ii) the 5 anti-symmetric matrices ( c a) and iii) the 10 symmetric matrices ( c sab) [36]. the
symmetry properties of the latter two follow directly from

b calculation of the killing spinor

in this appendix we shall calculate the matrix (x), which relates lorentz and so(4, 1)
spinors with each other. it will turn out that the lorentz spinor derived from the so(d+1, 1)
spinor  automatically is a killing spinor.

according to equation (32)  is an so(4, 1) spinor. however, a spinor eld (x) conven-
tionally is a lorentz spinor, i.e. it transforms as a spinor under rotations of the local lorentz
frame. hence, we introduce a matrix (x) and demand that the product (x)(x) be a
scalar with respect to symmetry transformations. the matrix (x) can be calculated using
the knowledge of the transformation laws under the so(4, 1) symmetries. thus,

(cid:16)(x)(x)(cid:17) =  (x)

 (x)

(x)  x (cid:0)(x)

(x)(cid:1)

(b.1)

where   and x are given by equations (32) and (9), respectively, and

 = xd +

as the parameters ai, bi,  and ij in x are independent, equation (b.1) yields the following
system of equations for :

s(pi) + i = 0,
s(d) + x = 0,
s(ki)  2xsi +(cid:0)2xix  x2i(cid:1)  = 0,
s(lij)  sij + (xij  xji)  = 0.

(b.2)

the solution of equations (b.2) is not unique, but any solution will suce. a solution of
equations (b.2) is

(x) =

x0

(1 + 0)

2x0

(1  0) +

xi

i(1  0).

it is also useful to know the inverse 1, which is easily found to be

1(x) =

2x0

(1 + 0)

(1  0) +

i(1  0).

(b.3)

(b.4)

consider the spinor (), which by construction is a lorentz spinor. since  = 1 ,

one nds

(1 ) = (c 1)(),

(b.5)

where c 1 is the inverse of the charge conjugation matrix c for lorentz spinors. equation
(b.5) yields c = t c, which, together with equation (b.3), leads to c =  c.

finally, one can check explicitly from the expression (b.3) that

d() =

(),

(b.6)

which shows that (x) = 1(x) is a killing spinor.
