abstract

we consider chiral gauge theories dened over a xed four-dimensional space-time manifold with
cartesian product structure, e.g. the product of minkowskian 3-space and a circle. for a simple
set-up, we calculate the eective gauge eld action obtained from integrating out the chiral
fermions, while maintaining gauge invariance. due to a combination of infrared and ultraviolet
eects, there appears a cpt-odd term in the eective gauge eld action. the cpt anomaly
could occur in chiral gauge theories which are relevant to elementary particle physics, provided
the space-time manifold has the appropriate topology.

1 introduction

the cpt theorem is one of the most important results in local relativistic quantum
eld theory [1, 2, 3]. the theorem states that the combined operation (cpt) of charge
conjugation (c), parity reection (p) and time reversal (t) is an invariance of this class
of theories, even if some of the separate invariances do not hold. any cpt violation
is, therefore, believed to require fundamentally dierent physics, e.g. quantum gravity
[4, 5] or strings [6]. it may, then, come as a surprise that a particular class of relativistic
quantum eld theories (specically, chiral gauge theories) has given an indication of cpt
violation [7].

the theories considered in ref.

[7] are chiral non-abelian gauge theories, with one
space direction singled-out by the prescribed four-dimensional space-time manifold m.
an example would be su(3) yang-mills theory [8] with a single triplet of left-handed weyl
fermions [9], dened over the euclidean manifold m = ir3  s 1, which is the cartesian
product of euclidean 3-space and a circle. the perturbative chiral gauge anomalies [10,
11, 12, 13] of this theory can be cancelled by the introduction of an octet of elementary
pseudo-scalar elds with the standard gauged wess-zumino term in the action [14, 15].
remarkably, there remains a non-perturbative su(3) gauge anomaly [16], which is similar
to, but not the same as, the witten su(2) gauge anomaly [17]. in this case, however,
there exists a local counterterm which restores su(3) gauge invariance, but at the price
of lorentz non-invariance and cpt violation [7]. in other words, the chiral non-abelian
gauge anomaly is transmuted into a cpt anomaly. (the situation is analogous to that
of certain three-dimensional non-abelian gauge theories with massless fermions, where
gauge invariance is restored at the price of p- and t-violation and the non-abelian gauge
anomaly is transmuted into the so-called parity anomaly [18, 19, 20, 21].)

the particular counterterm presented in ref. [7] is the space-time integral of a chern-
simons density [22] involving three of the four gauge potentials. (the precise denition
will be given later on.) such a term violates local lorentz invariance. physically, this
would show up, to rst order, as a direction-dependent rotation of the linear polarization
of a plane wave of gauge elds traveling in vacuo [23]. moreover, the integrand of this
counterterm is cpt-odd, whereas the yang-mills action density is cpt-even.

we have obtained some heuristic arguments of why the counterterm must violate
lorentz and cpt invariance, but the uniqueness of the counterterm has not been estab-
lished. if, on the other hand, the chiral non-abelian gauge anomaly is really as discussed
above, then the eective gauge eld action due to the chiral fermions, formulated and
regularized in a gauge invariant manner, must also exhibit some sign of cpt violation
(and lorentz non-invariance). it is the goal of the present paper to establish this cpt
violation. maintaining chiral gauge invariance, we will nd for space-time manifolds with
cartesian product structure a cpt-violating term in the eective gauge eld action which
is precisely equal to the counterterm presented in ref. [7]. this cpt-violating term does

1

not appear in vector-like gauge theories, but can appear in any anomaly-free chiral gauge
theory.

the outline of this paper is as follows. in section 2, we give the set-up of the problem
and establish our notation. in section 3, we choose some simple background gauge poten-
tials and nd a chern-simons-like term in the eective gauge eld action. the calculation
applies to both abelian and non-abelian chiral gauge groups. in section 4, we show that
the chern-simons-like term found violates cpt. in other words, these particular chiral
gauge eld theories have a cpt anomaly if gauge invariance is maintained. in section
5, we exhibit a class of chiral gauge theories which necessarily have the cpt anomaly
(the so-called standard model of elementary particle physics can be embedded in some of
them). in addition, we present some remarks on how the cpt theorem is circumvented
and discuss two possible applications of the cpt anomaly.

2 set-up

for deniteness, we take space-time to be the at euclidean manifold

m = ir3  s 1 ,

(2.1)

with coordinates xm  ir3 and x4  s 1. throughout this paper, latin indices k, l, m,
etc. run over the coordinate labels 1, 2, 3, and greek indices , , , etc. over 1, 2, 3, 4.
repeated coordinate (and internal) indices are summed over. natural units with h = c
= 1 are used and the length of the circle in the 4-direction is denoted by l.

we will rst consider non-abelian chiral gauge theories with a single irreducible rep-
resentation of massless left-handed fermions. specically, we take the standard chiral
yang-mills theory [8, 9] with gauge group g = so(10) and left-handed weyl fermions in
the complex representation r l = 16. (this particular model may have some relevance
for elementary particle physics phenomenology, as part of a so-called grand-unied theory,
cf. refs. [24, 25]). the fermionic eld is then li(x), with spinor index  = 1, 2, and
group index i = 1, . . . , 16. the gauge potentials are a(x)  e aa
(x) t a, a = 1, . . . ,
45, with e the gauge coupling constant and t a the anti-hermitian generators of the lie
group so(10) in the representation chosen, normalized by tr (t at b) =  1

2 ab.

in this paper, we are interested in the eective gauge eld action obtained from inte-
grating out the chiral fermions, while maintaining gauge invariance. formally, we have
from the weyl fermions

exp {w[a ]} = z d

l dl expni wh

l, l, aio ,

for the euclidean action

(2.2)

(2.3)

with 
  (i~, 1 ) dened in terms of the 2  2 pauli matrices m and the 2  2 identity
matrix 1 . the chiral so(10) gauge theory is anomaly free [12, 13, 16, 17] and the eective
gauge eld action is invariant under local gauge transformations,

 w [ g (a + d) g1 ] =  w [a ] ,

g(x)  g ,

(2.4)

with d the exterior derivative for dierential forms.

if the chiral gauge theory considered is not anomaly free (for example, the theory
mentioned in the introduction, with g = su(3) and r l = 3), then the theory has to be
modied in order to make it gauge invariant. one way to restore gauge invariance is by
averaging over the gauge orbits,

exp { [a ]}  z dh expn  w [ h (a + d) h1 ]o .

(2.5)

the interpretation of the resulting theory with the variables h(x)  g is not entirely clear,
though [26]. another way to restore gauge invariance is by introducing further fermions,
which cancel the chiral anomalies of the original fermions [13]. in section 5, we will discuss
some of these theories with reducible fermion representation. all of these complications
are, however, not necessary for the anomaly-free chiral gauge theory considered here,
which has gauge group g = so(10) and fermion representation r l = 16.

at this point, there is no need to be specic about the regularization of the eective
gauge eld action  w [a ]. perhaps the regularization is best done by the introduction of
a space-time lattice cut-o, which (temporarily?) sacrices lorentz invariance but keeps
the gauge and chiral invariances. (see refs.
[27, 28] and references therein.) this last
point, though, is important, since we intend to look for symmetry violations being forced
upon us by maintaining exact gauge invariance in a theory with genuine chiral fermions.

3 calculation

as discussed in the introduction, our goal is to establish the presence of a cpt-violating
term in the eective gauge eld action. the strategy is to simplify the calculation as much
as possible. we, therefore, take the case of x4-independent so(10) gauge potentials, with
the one gauge potential corresponding to the special direction (x4  s 1 for the euclidean
manifold m = ir3  s 1) vanishing altogether,

am(~x, x4) = am(~x) , a4(~x, x4) = 0 .

(3.1)

also, the gauge potentials considered vanish on the boundary of a ball b3 embedded in
ir3, and outside of it,

am(~x) = 0

for

|~x|  r ,

(3.2)

3

with r a xed radius which can be taken to innity at the end of the calculation.

the left-handed fermionic elds in the spinor representation 16 of so(10) can be ex-

panded as follows

l(~x, x4) =


l(~x, x4) =





xn=
xn=

e+2inx4/l n(~x) ,

e2inx4/l 

n(~x) ,

and the weyl action (2.3) for the gauge potentials (3.1) becomes

i w =



xn= zir3

d3x l 

n (cid:16) m (m + am)  2n/l(cid:17) n .

redening the two (independent) spinor elds

n(~x)  i l n(~x) , 

n(~x)  

n(~x) ,

the action reads

i w =





xn= zir3
i 3h
xn=



n, n, ai .

d3x 

n (cid:16) i m(m + am) + 2in/l(cid:17) n

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

we have thus obtained an innite set of three-dimensional euclidean dirac elds n(~x)
with masses 2n/l, all of which interact with the same three-dimensional gauge potentials
am(~x).
(all this is, of course, reminiscent of kaluza-klein theory, which reduces ve
space-time dimensions to four. see ref. [29] and references therein.)

for the special background potentials (3.1), the eective action (2.2) factorizes to

expnw[ a ]o 



yn=(cid:18) z d

n dn expni 3h

n, n, aio (cid:19) ,

(3.7)

with i 3 as dened in (3.6). each factor in (3.7) can be regularized separately by the
introduction of appropriate three-dimensional pauli-villars elds [30, 31].3 this pauli-
villars regularization preserves the residual local gauge invariance

n  u(g) n ,

am  g(cid:16) am + m(cid:17) g1 ,

3these three-dimensional regulator elds introduce a breaking of lorentz invariance in the four-
dimensional context. this breaking will show up later as a nite remnant in the eective gauge eld
action. for the moment, it is an open question whether or not the same happens for the lattice regular-
ization mentioned in the last paragraph of section 2.

g(~x)  g ,

(3.8)

with u the appropriate unitary representation for the fermions and g(~x) = 1 for |~x| 
r. even though this is not the full gauge invariance (2.4) of the theory, it turns out to
be sucient for our purpose. furthermore, the infrared divergences in the n = 0 factor of
(3.7) can be regularized by imposing antiperiodic boundary conditions for the dirac (and
pauli-villars) elds on the surface of the ball b3, where the gauge potentials (3.2) vanish.

for our calculation, it is sucient to introduce for each (anticommuting) eld n(~x)
with mass mn  2n/l a single (commuting) pauli-villars eld n(~x) with mass n 
mn + sign(n) |n|, where |n| is taken to be positive for n 6= 0. formally, this gives for
(3.7) the following product:

k + (ml + l)2 ! ,

(3.9)

in terms of the real eigenvalues k of the massless dirac operator d 3[ a ]   i m (m +
am). the factors in (3.7) with n =  l, for l > 0, thus combine to give a real contribution
to the eective gauge eld action w[a]. moreover, it is clear that the spectral ow
[18, 19] of the full three-dimensional dirac operator can occur only in the n = 0 factor
(there is a mass-gap for n 6= 0), and that the non-abelian gauge anomaly, which shows
up in the imaginary part of w[a], resides there.

the imaginary part of the eective gauge eld action for massless three-dimensional
dirac fermions, with pauli-villars regularization to maintain gauge invariance, has already
been calculated [18, 19]. revisiting the perturbative calculation, we nd for non-abelian
gauge groups

the sign ambiguity in (3.10) traces back to the parity-violating pauli-villars mass 0
used to regularize the ultraviolet divergences of the three-dimensional feynman diagrams.
(here, parity violation is meant in the three-dimensional sense.) the  sign in (3.10)
comes, in fact, from a factor 0/|0| out of the momentum integrals. the triangle dia-
gram, for example, gives in the limit |0|

it is crucial that the infrared divergences of the three-dimensional feynman diagrams
without pauli-villars elds are not regularized by the introduction of a small dirac mass
0, which would again violate parity invariance, but that they are kept under control by
the antiperiodic boundary conditions imposed on the fermions (turning the momentum
integrals into sums).

the essential conditions for the derivation of (3.10) are the requirement of gauge in-
variance (3.8) and the control of infrared divergences in the n = 0 factor of (3.7). for
non-abelian gauge groups, there is, in addition to the term (3.10) obtained in pertur-
bation theory, also a non-local term in am(~x) which restores the full three-dimensional
gauge invariance (3.8), not just its innitesimal version. this non-local term vanishes,
however, for gauge potentials am(~x) suciently close to zero. see refs.
[19, 21] and
references therein.

the integral in (3.10) can be extended over the whole of 3-space, because the gauge
potentials am vanish outside the ball b3. since the gauge potentials am are also x4-
independent, the expression (3.10) can trivially be written as a four-dimensional integral

with parameter a = 0 for the non-abelian gauge groups considered up till now. the
three-dimensional calculation for abelian gauge potentials gives essentially the same result
[18, 20], with the factor  in (3.10) replaced by 2 and the parameter a in (3.13) set equal
to 1.

the chern-simons-like term (3.13), which comes from a combination of infrared (n = 0)
and ultraviolet (|0|  ) eects, is the main result of this paper. the result was
derived for the particular chiral gauge theory with gauge group g = so(10) and fermion
representation r l = 16, but holds for arbitrary (non-)abelian gauge group and arbitrary
non-singlet irreducible fermion representation, as long as the fermion representation is
normalized appropriately and the complete theory is free of chiral gauge anomalies (see
section 5). this completes the calculations of this paper. in the last two sections, we will
take a closer look at the result.

4 cpt violation

for the special gauge potentials (3.1), (3.2) and the euclidean space-time manifold m =
ir3 s 1, we have found in the previous section the emergence of a chern-simons-like term
(3.13) in the eective gauge eld action. the calculation, which relies on earlier results
for the three-dimensional parity anomaly, applies to both abelian and non-abelian gauge
groups, provided the chiral gauge anomalies cancel in the complete theory (see section
5).

the eective action term (3.13) can be generalized for arbitrary gauge potentials to the

following local expression:

d3x z l

dx4 (1 + a) 

l

 cs(a1(~x, x4), a2(~x, x4), a3(~x, x4)) , (4.1)

with an integer parameter a = 0, 1, for non-abelian and abelian gauge groups, re-
spectively, and the chern-simons density cs as dened in (3.11). eq. (4.1), for non-
abelian gauge groups, is precisely equal to the counterterm presented in ref [7]. the
eective action term (4.1) has the important property of invariance under innitesimal
four-dimensional gauge transformations.4 as mentioned in section 3, there is, for non-
abelian gauge groups, also a non-local term in the eective gauge eld action which re-
stores invariance under nite four-dimensional gauge transformations, but this non-local
term vanishes for gauge potentials a(x) suciently close to zero.

the chern-simons density cs in the eective action term (4.1) involves only three
of the four gauge potentials a(x) and three of the six components of the eld strength
tensor a(x)  a  a + [ a , a ]. this makes the eective gauge eld action
manifestly lorentz non-invariant. physically, this would, for example, lead to anisotropic
propagation of the gauge boson elds [23]. note that the terms (4.1) applied to the gauge
groups su(3), su(2), and u(1), with undetermined coecients replacing (1+a) /l, have
also been considered in a standard-model extension with lorentz violation [32]. the non-
invariance of these terms under certain large gauge transformations [7, 20] suggests that
either these coecients must be zero or that additional non-local terms restoring gauge
invariance must be included in the theory. as discussed in the preceding paragraph,
the eective action calculation of the present paper chooses the second alternative, with
non-local terms restoring gauge invariance.

we are not able to determine the presence of (4.1) in the eective gauge eld action
rigorously,5 but for our purpose the result (3.13) suces. the appropriate cpt transfor-
mation [1, 31] for an anti-hermitian gauge potential is, namely,

a(x)  at

 (x) ,

(4.2)

with the sux t indicating the transpose of the matrix. using (4.2) one can readily
check that the yang-mills action density tr (aa) is cpt-even and that the integrand
of the chern-simons-like term (3.13), or eq. (4.1) for that matter, is cpt-odd. (the
over-all factor i in (3.13), or (4.1), is absent for space-time manifolds with minkowskian

replaced by,

4this property would not hold if the particular chern-simons density cs as given by (4.1) were
for example, cs(a1(~x), a2(~x), a3(~x)), with the averaged gauge potentials am(~x) 
0 dx4 am(~x, x4). of course, such an action term using the averaged gauge potentials am would

not be local either.

signature and need not be complex conjugated.) this establishes the cpt anomaly for
gauge theories with chiral fermions in an arbitrary non-singlet irreducible representation
(provided the chiral gauge anomalies cancel in the complete theory) and euclidean space-
time manifold m = ir3  s 1.

the abelian chern-simons density has no cubic term and the abelian version of (4.1) is
odd under both cpt and t, provided x4 corresponds to a space coordinate after the wick
rotation from euclidean to minkowskian signature. the t and cpt violation would, for
example, show up in the propagation of the circular polarization modes of these abelian
gauge elds [23].

5 discussion

the eective gauge eld action for certain chiral gauge theories dened over a xed four-
dimensional euclidean space-time manifold m with product structure ir3  s 1 has been
found to contain a cpt-violating term if gauge invariance is maintained. for the special
gauge potentials (3.1), this cpt-violating term is given by (3.13), which can be generalized
to (4.1) for arbitrary gauge potentials. essentially the same result holds for other space-
time manifolds m, as long as at least one compact space dimension can be factored out.
an example would be the at minkowski-like manifold m = ir  s 1  s 1  s 1, with
time t  ir and compact 3-space, which would have three terms of the form (4.1) in the
eective gauge eld action.

the calculation of the cpt-violating term in section 3 was performed for a single ir-
reducible representation of left-handed weyl fermions. the particular theory considered,
with gauge group g = so(10) and fermion representation r l = 16, is free of chiral gauge
anomalies [12, 13, 16, 17]. it is, of course, possible to have more than one non-singlet irre-
ducible fermion representation for the left-handed fermions, provided the chiral anomalies

cancel. the reducible fermion representation is then r l = pf rf , with f running over 1,

. . . , nf . vector-like gauge theories with, for example, a single irreducible representation r
have r l = r + r and corresponding three-dimensional pauli-villars masses 0r and 0r,
where r denotes the conjugate representation of r. four-dimensional parity invariance
requires that 0r and 0r have opposite signs, so that the cpt anomaly (4.1) cancels.

chiral gauge theories with r l = pf rf may, or may not, have a cpt-violating term

(4.1) left over in the eective gauge eld action, depending on the relative signs of the
corresponding pauli-villars masses 0f .6

for a chiral gauge theory with an odd number nf of equal

irreducible left-handed
fermion representations, there necessarily appears a cpt-violating term proportional to

6attention must be paid to the normalization of the irreducible representations rf . also, the situation
can be complicated further by having more three-dimensional pauli-villars elds than the ones used in
section 3. the factor  i in (3.10), (3.13), and (4.1), would then be replaced by (2 k + 1) i, for k  zz.
see ref. [21] for further discussion.

(4.1) in the eective gauge eld action. (the reason is that the sum of an odd number of

odd numbers, pf (2 kf + 1) for kf  zz, is odd, whereas zero is even.) an example would

be the chiral so(10) gauge theory with reducible fermion representation r l = 16 + 16
+ 16, which necessarily has a cpt-violating term proportional to (4.1) for the so(10)
gauge elds in the eective action. as is well known, this so(10) model contains the
su(3)  su(2)  u(1) standard model [25, 31] with 3 families of 15 left-handed weyl
fermions, together with 3 singlets of weyl fermions (the conjugates of the right-handed
neutrinos). the standard model has thus a cpt-violating term proportional to (4.1) for
the hypercharge u(1) gauge elds in the eective action, together with similar terms for
the weak su(2) and color su(3) gauge elds, as long as the space-time manifold has a
cartesian product structure and the standard model is embedded in this particular chiral
so(10) gauge theory.7 the so(10) embedding condition for the standard model guaran-
tees the presence of these cpt-violating terms, otherwise there may, or may not, appear
such terms, depending on the regularization scheme chosen.

having established for certain chiral gauge theories the necessary presence of a cpt-
violating term in the gauge-invariant eective action, the question is what happened to
the cpt theorem? it appears that the cpt theorem is circumvented by a break-down of
local lorentz invariance at the quantum level. (see also the remark in footnote 3.) more
specically, the second-quantized vacuum seems to play a role in connecting the global
space-time structure to the local physics. this can be explained as follows.

for non-abelian chiral gauge groups, there is the extra condition of gauge invariance in
these quantum eld theories which are potentially aicted by the non-perturbative chiral
gauge anomaly discovered earlier [16]. this non-perturbative chiral gauge anomaly de-
pends on the global space-time structure in a lorentz non-invariant way (one direction be-
ing singled-out by the so-called z-string conguration responsible for the gauge anomaly).
if the theory has indeed this z-string global gauge anomaly, then the restoration of gauge
invariance obviously requires interactions which are themselves lorentz non-invariant [7].
but, even if the theory does not have a net z-string global gauge anomaly, there still
occurs the spectral ow which treats one space dimension dierently from the others [16].
this implies that the second-quantized vacuum state changes under the corresponding
gauge transformations. imposing gauge invariance then leads to lorentz non-invariance
of the theory. in both cases, the invariance under the proper orthochronous lorentz group
is lost and the cpt theorem [1] no longer applies. there is then the possibility of having
a non-abelian cpt-odd term (4.1) in the eective gauge eld action.

for abelian chiral gauge groups, non-zero magnetic ux from monopoles seems to play
a role similar to that of the gauge anomaly for non-abelian gauge groups, as discussed for
the three-dimensional case in ref. [20]. for the four-dimensional case, this set-up breaks
lorentz invariance (just as the z-string does for the non-abelian gauge anomaly) and the

7it is not clear to what extent the 33 remaining gauge bosons from so(10) need to be physical, but

they could always be given large masses by the higgs mechanism [24, 25].

cpt theorem no longer applies, with the possibility of having an abelian cpt-odd term
(4.1) in the eective gauge eld action.

for both abelian and non-abelian chiral gauge groups, it remains to be seen whether
or not the gauge invariant, but cpt-violating, theory is consistent (with, for example,
microcausality and positivity of the energy, cf. ref. [32]). if not, the theory could perhaps
be interpreted as part of a more fundamental theory, possibly involving gravitation.

in this paper, we have primarily been concerned with the mechanism of the cpt
anomaly, not potential applications. let us, however, mention two possibilities. first,
there may be the optical activity [23] discussed in the introduction, where the linear
polarization of a plane wave of gauge elds gets rotated in vacuo (in our case, through
the quantum eects of the chiral fermions). as mentioned above, the eect could happen
for the photon eld of the standard model, as long as the space-time manifold has a
cartesian product structure. the laboratory measurement of this optical activity of the
vacuum could, in principle, provide information about the global structure and size of
the universe. more realistically, the mass scale for the cpt-violating term (4.1) is of the
order of

with g either equal to the u(1) gauge coupling constant g 1 or to the su(2) gauge coupling
constant g 2, depending on which gauge eld contributes most to the photon [31], and l
the range of the compact space coordinate. this mass is, of course, very small on the scale
of the known elementary particles (the present universe being very large), but, remarkably,
it is only a factor 100 below the current experimental limit of  1042 gev obtained from
observations on distant radio galaxies, see refs.
[23, 33] and references therein. (the
laboratory has now been expanded to a signicant part of the visible universe.) a de-
dicated observation program to map the linear polarization in a large number of distant
radio sources, or future spacecraft missions to measure the polarization of the cosmic
microwave background, can perhaps reach the sensitivity level set by (5.1).

second, the cpt anomaly may have been important in the very early universe.

in
the present paper, we have considered a xed space-time manifold with given topology.
with gravity, space-time becomes dynamic. for an inverse circumference 1/l(t) and
typical scattering energies of the order of the gravity scale (planck mass), the cpt-
violating eects of eq. (4.1) become relatively unsuppressed compared to gravity, that is
suppressed by the square of the gauge coupling constant only. of course, the fundamental
theory of gravitation remains to be determined if there is indeed lorentz non-invariance
in certain inertial frames. still, it is conceivable that the cpt anomaly plays a role in
dening a fundamental arrow of time [4, 5], as an eect coming from the interplay of
chiral fermions, gauge eld interactions and the topology of space-time.
