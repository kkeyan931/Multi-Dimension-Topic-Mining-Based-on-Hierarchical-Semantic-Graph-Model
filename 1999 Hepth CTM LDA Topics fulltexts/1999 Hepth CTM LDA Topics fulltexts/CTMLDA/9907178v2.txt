(non-gravitational) theory obtained by studying string theory on a singular calabi-yau

1. introduction

in [1] it was proposed that vacua of string theory which asymptote at weak coupling

to linear dilaton backgrounds are holographic  string theory in such vacua is dual to a

theory without gravity in a lower dimension. the dual theory is in general not a local

qft.

the only example discussed in detail in [1] was string theory in the near-horizon

geometry of n s5-branes [2], which was argued to be dual to the non-local theory that

governs the dynamics of n s5-branes at vanishing string coupling [3] (see also [4,5]). it

was further noted in [1] that a rich set of linear dilaton vacua is provided by the non-

critical superstring construction of [6]. the problem of identifying the corresponding

non-gravitational spacetime theory was (in general) left open in [1].

the main purpose of this note is to ll this gap and propose dual descriptions for a
large class of non-critical superstring models in d spacetime dimensions1. we will argue

that the dual theory is obtained by studying string theory on

ird1,1  x 2n ,

2n = 10  d ,

(1.1)

where x 2n is a singular calabi-yau manifold. sending gs  0 at xed ls gives rise as
in [3] to a d dimensional theory without gravity describing the dynamics of modes living
near the singularity on x 2n. this theory is dual to string theory in a background which
approaches at weak coupling ird1,1  ir  n , where ir is the real line along which the
dilaton changes linearly, and n is related to x 2n in a way described below.

in two dimensions, the construction involves string theory on ir1,1  x 8, where x 8 is
a singular cy fourfold. adding fundamental strings at the singularity in x 8 and owing

to the infrared leads to a two dimensional cft which is dual via the ads/cft correspon-

dence [7] to an n = 2 supersymmetric ads3 vacuum of the sort recently discussed in [8,9]

following [10].

in four dimensions, special cases of the construction correspond to the theory on an
n s5-brane with worldvolume ir3,1  , where  is a riemann surface; these examples
might be of interest for describing qcd via branes [11,12].

the plan of this paper is the following. we start in section 2 with a review of the non-

critical superstring construction of [6]. we discuss the symmetry structure of these string

1 we will consider the cases d = 2, 4, 6.

vacua and construct some observables which belong to short representations of spacetime

supersymmetry.

in section 3 we dene the dual theories (1.1) and study some of their properties. we

propose the duality and perform a few simple checks of its validity. we also point out the

similarity of our proposal to the duality between large n matrix quantum mechanics in

the double scaling limit and 1 + 1 dimensional string theory in a linear dilaton background

[13].

in section 4 we discuss in turn two, four and six dimensional examples of our con-

struction. we make contact with recent work on string theory on ads3, and with theories

on branes which are relevant for solving strongly coupled gauge theories. we also discuss

the resolution of strong coupling singularities of non-critical superstrings.

some of the technical details are contained in an appendix.

2. non-critical superstrings

consider superstring propagation on

ird1,1  ir  n ,

(2.1)

where n is a manifold whose properties will be specied below. the real line ir is
parametrized by . the dilaton  is linear in ,

 = 

q
2

 .

(2.2)

the string coupling gs  e goes to zero as    and diverges as   . in regions
where gs is large, the perturbative denition of the theory is not useful. to fully dene

string theory in the background (2.1), (2.2), one must either eliminate the strong coupling

region, or provide a denition of the theory at strong coupling.

in the rest of this section we summarize some properties of the worldsheet description

of the vacuum (2.1); this description is reliable in regions where the string coupling is

small. the linear dilaton (2.2) implies that the worldsheet stress-tensor and central charge

of  are

t(z) = 

1

2 (cid:2)(z)2 + q2

z (cid:3) ,

c =1 + 3q2 .

(2.3)

2

the worldsheet superpartner of  is ; the superconformal current is

tf = z + qz .

(2.4)

consistency of fermionic string propagation requires the worldsheet theory on n to be an
n = 1 scft with central charge cn = 3(n  1
2  q2), where n is given in (1.1). we will
also assume that n is compact and non-singular, so that the worldsheet scft on n is
unitary and has a discrete spectrum of scaling dimensions.

the construction of [6] requires that the worldsheet scft on n have the following

additional properties:

(a) an ane u (1) symmetry with supercurrent

u(1) + j u(1) .

(2.5)

(b) the coset n /u (1) must have an n = 2 superconformal symmetry with central charge

cn /u(1) = 3(n  1  q2) .

(2.6)

if both of these conditions hold, one can construct a type ii string vacuum with (at least)
2 d

2 +1 supercharges as follows. it is convenient to write the ane current (2.5) as

j u(1) = iy ,

(2.7)

where y is a canonically normalized scalar: y (z)y (w)   log(z  w). the n = 2
superconformal algebra on n /u (1) contains a u (1)r current j
cn /u(1)

normalized as

n /u(1)

(2.8)

which can be expressed in terms of a canonically normalized scalar z as

j

n /u(1)
r

= ir cn /u(1)

z  iaz , a  pn  1  q2 .

(2.9)

it is also convenient to bosonize the worldsheet fermions , u(1) in terms of a scalar
eld h: h = u(1). the spacetime supercharges are given by [6]

q+

 =i dz e 
 =i dz e

(2.10)

where  is the scalar eld arising in the bosonized ,  superghost system of the fermionic
string, and s, s  are spinors of so(d 1, 1) [14]. for d = 2 mod 4, s, s  are isomorphic
it is not dicult to check that the
spinors, while for d = 0 mod 4 they are distinct.

supercharges (2.10) are brst invariant and mutually local on the worldsheet (and thus
physical), and that they form the spacetime superalgebra ( = 0, 1,    , d  1)

{q+, q} = p .

(2.11)

all the other anticommutators vanish. in (2.11) p is the momentum along ird1,1 and 
are the corresponding dirac matrices. the supercharges (2.10) carry charge q/2 under
the u (1) symmetry (2.7), which is thus an r-symmetry in spacetime. it is customary to
normalize the r-charge so that the supercharges have r = 1. thus we dene

r = i

2

q i y .

(2.12)

in a type ii string, there are also supercharges q that arise in a similar fashion from
the other worldsheet chirality. for d = 2 mod 4, q+ and q transform in isomorphic
spinor representations of so(d 1, 1). if furthermore q and q transform as isomorphic
spinors, the theory has chiral supersymmetry in spacetime; if q and q transform as

dierent spinors, the spacetime supersymmetry is non-chiral. this is analogous to the

choice of iia or iib strings in ten dimensions. the full r-charge for the type ii case is
r + r, where r is the antiholomorphic analog of (2.12).

observables in linear dilaton theories correspond to non-normalizable vertex operators
whose wavefunctions diverge in the weak coupling region    [15]. we next discuss
a few examples. consider an n = 1 superconformal primary in the cft on n which is
primary with charge q under the u (1)r symmetry (2.7), and whose projection in n /u (1),
v , is primary under the full n = 2 worldsheet superconformal algebra. such an operator

can be written as

eiqy v .

(2.13)

we denote the scaling dimension of v by v and its u (1)r charge (under (2.9)) by qv .
unitarity of the n = 2 scft on n /u (1) implies that

v  |qv |

2

,

(2.14)

with equality when v is a chiral operator in the worldsheet theory on n /u (1). one can
form a physical observable out of (2.13) as follows:

e ei~k~x+iqy +v ,

(2.15)

where ~k is the momentum along ird1,1 and  is the liouville dressing. the mass-shell
condition and gso projection (mutual locality of (2.15) with (2.10)) lead to the following

physical state constraints:

2|~k|2 +
qv  qq  2z + 1 .

( + q) + v =

(2.16)

non-normalizability of the wavefunction as    implies that (2.15) must satisfy2

  

q
2

.

(2.17)

one can think of (2.15) as a fermionic string tachyon3; because of the chiral gso

projection it is of course never tachyonic [6].

another set of observables corresponds to gravitons, whose (1, 1) picture vertex

operators have the form:

e  ei~k~x+iqy +v ,

(2.18)

where  are worldsheet fermions on ird1,1,  is the polarization, and the physical state
conditions are4

( + q) + v = 0 ,

qv  qq  2z .

as in critical string theory, there is an innite tower of observables generalizing (2.15),

(2.18); we will not discuss them here.

chiral operators, that belong to short representations of spacetime supersymmetry,

are of special interest. such operators can be obtained by taking v to be a chiral operator

on the worldsheet, for which the inequality (2.14) is saturated (we will take qv to be non-
negative, and v = qv /2), and setting the momentum along ird1,1 to zero. consider

2 for  = q/2 the non-normalizable solution is exp(q/2).
3 it is a tachyon if v is a function on n /u (1). in general, (2.15) corresponds to an excited

state of the string.

4 in addition, there are transversality conditions on  which we will not specify.

5

rst the tachyon (2.15). one can solve the constraints (2.16) by setting  = q, qv 
qq = 1. it can be shown that the resulting operator belongs to a short representation of

spacetime supersymmetry. the r-charge (2.12) of a chiral tachyon operator (2.15) is

rv =

2q
q

=

2(qv  1)

q2

.

(2.20)

note that the constraint (2.17) applied to these chiral operators implies5 that qv  1 >
q2/2 or

(2.21)

qv +

q2
2  1 > 0 .

for q2 > 2 this constraint is automatically satised, since by assumption qv  0, while
for q2 < 2 it implies that some of the chiral operators on the worldsheet do not give rise

to chiral operators in spacetime.

the last statement should be qualied somewhat. first, note that the chiral operators

just constructed are top components of chiral superelds in spacetime. one way of seeing
that is the following. in the (1, 1) picture, the operator (2.15) with  = q and ~k = 0
has the form

e eq(+iy )v ;

(2.22)

eq(+iy )v is the bottom component of a worldsheet chiral supereld with scaling dimension

(1/2, 1/2). the (0, 0) picture vertex operator is the top component of this chiral super-

eld. such operators can be added to the worldsheet lagrangian without breaking (2, 2)

superconformal symmetry [16], and therefore also spacetime supersymmetry.

what is the spacetime interpretation of adding the operator (2.22) to the worldsheet

lagrangian? according to [1], the operator (2.15) corresponds to an o shell observable
o(~x) in the dual, non-gravitational theory6. the ~k = 0 mode of (2.15), given by (2.22),
corresponds to r dd~xo(~x), and adding it to the worldsheet lagrangian corresponds in the
dual theory to adding r dd~xo(~x) to the spacetime action. the fact that doing that does

not break supersymmetry implies that o(~x) is the top component of a chiral supereld.

5 in the case  = q/2 one does not nd a chiral operator because of the insertion of  in

front of the exponential (see footnote 2).

6 we are speaking loosely here. the dual theory probably does not have local observables.
it does have observables labeled by arbitrary d dimensional momenta such as (2.15), (2.18), but

there may be subtleties in fourier transforming to real space (see [17,18] for further discussion).

6

the bottom component of this supereld, vbottom, is killed by half of the supercharges
1

 . acting on vbottom with the remaining half of the supercharges, the 2

in (2.10), q+

(2.23)

note that it always satises rbottom  2(qv 1)

q2

+ 1. the constraint (2.21) implies that

therefore, what we have found before is that chiral worldsheet operators which do not

satisfy (2.21) do not give rise to observables of the form (2.15) which are top components

of chiral spacetime superelds. instead, they give rise to bottom components of antichiral

spacetime superelds. indeed, returning to (2.15), another solution to the physical state
conditions (2.16) with ~k = 0 is  = q  q, q = (qv  1)/q. since q has the same value
as before, the r-charge of the corresponding spacetime operator,

e e(q+q)+iqy v ,

is again given by (2.20). the condition (2.17) for non-normalizability of (2.24) is

qv +

q2
2  1 < 0 ,

(2.24)

(2.25)

the opposite of (2.21). the r-charge (2.20) is negative denite in the regime (2.25), which

is simply the statement that the corresponding operator is the bottom component of an

antichiral spacetime supereld.

the top components of spacetime superelds (2.22), (2.24) play an important role

in the theory. as discussed in [6,1], due to the linear dilaton (2.2) the string coupling
diverges as   . there are dierent known mechanisms for regulating this strong
coupling divergence. one that was used in [6], and will play a role below, is to add to
the worldsheet lagrangian an operator of the form (2.22) with q/2 < q < 0. this sets
a scale for uctuations of . for q < 0 the vertex operator (2.22) grows as   
(the wavefunction, which diers from the vertex operator by a factor of gs, is always
supported at   ). thus, it prevents the system from running to the strong coupling
region   . vertex operators which grow as    can be thought of as relevant
operators in linear dilaton backgrounds. ref. [6] used the operator (2.22) with v = 1, the

n = 2 cosmological constant of n = 2 liouville theory, to set the scale. this operator

7

exists only for q2 > 2 (2.21). for q2 < 2 one may try to use a relevant worldsheet chiral
operator with 1 > qv > 1  q2

2 , if one exists.

alternatively, one may use the top component of an antichiral supereld associated

with (2.24). however, in this case there is the following subtlety. one nice property of

(2.22) is that if the operator v is the bottom component of a relevant supereld in the
worldsheet scft on n /u (1) (i.e. qv < 1), the dressed operator (2.22) is relevant in
spacetime (i.e. q < 0), and vice versa. for the antichiral operators (2.24), the relation is

more complicated. for such operators

 = q  q =

1  qv  q2

q

.

they are relevant in spacetime (i.e. have  < 0) if

q2
2

1 

> qv > 1  q2

(2.26)

(2.27)

(the rst inequality is (2.25)). as mentioned above, for q2 > 2 (2.27) has no solutions
with qv  0. for 2 > q2 > 1 all operators (2.24) which satisfy (2.25) are relevant in
spacetime (as well as on the worldsheet). for q2 < 1, operators with qv < 1  q2 are
relevant on the worldsheet but irrelevant in spacetime.

comments:

(1) our discussion of the relevance in spacetime concerned the operators (2.24), which

are bottom components of spacetime superelds. since the spacetime supercharges

do not change the  dependence of the wavefunctions, the same analysis holds for the

top components, which are the operators one would actually add to the worldsheet

lagrangian.

(2) equation (2.26) has the strange property that the more relevant the operator v is

on the worldsheet, the less relevant the corresponding operator (2.24) is in spacetime.

we do not understand this behavior.

(3) a similar analysis can be performed for gravitons (2.18). chiral operators correspond

to  = q = qv /q. the corresponding r-charge is

rv =

2qv
q2

.

(2.28)

to recapitulate, the procedure outlined above leads to a non-critical superstring theory in
2 +1 supercharges. the theory is not conformal, and the arguments of

d dimensions with 2

d

8

[1] suggest that it is holographically related to a (perhaps non-local) d dimensional theory

without gravity.

in the next section we will propose a candidate for the theory without gravity which
is related by the duality of [1] to the string vacua described above. we will specialize7 to a
class of backgrounds (2.1) for which the worldsheet cft on n is a product of the s1 (2.5)
and a landau-ginzburg (lg) n = 2 scft of n + 1 chiral superelds za, a = 1,    , n + 1,
with superpotential

where f is a quasi-homogenous polynomial with weight one under za  ra za, i.e.

w (za) = f (za) ,

f (raza) = f (za) ,   c ,

(2.29)

(2.30)

for some set of positive weights ra. here and below we take f to be transverse, i.e. the
only point at which all derivatives za f vanish is the origin, za = 0.

in applications, the worldsheet cft on n is in general not a direct product of s1
and the lg model (2.29). often, one can reach a point in moduli space where the two are

decoupled, and we will assume that we are at such a point in the analysis below. it is easy

to generalize to situations where this is not the case.

the worldsheet central charge cw corresponding to (2.29) is

1

cw =

n+1

xa=1

(1  2ra) = n + 1  2xa

ra .

it is useful to dene

in terms of which

r

cw = 3(n  1  2r) .

comparing (2.33) to (2.6) we see that

q2 = 2r .

(2.31)

(2.32)

(2.33)

(2.34)

in particular, r must be positive in this construction.

7 it is probably possible to generalize our discussion to the most general compact manifold n

satisfying the constraints described above. this is left for future work.

9

chiral operators are constructed as in the general discussion above. the worldsheet
chiral operators v are in this case polynomials8 in za, ai(za), which have weights ri under
za  ra za. their worldsheet r-charges qv are equal to ri. as discussed above, one can
construct chiral operators in spacetime out of the ai by dressing them in dierent ways.
the dressing (2.15) gives rise to the chiral operator

e eq(+iy )ai ,

where q = (ri  1)/q; the r-charge (2.20) is

ri =

ri  1
r

.

(2.35)

(2.36)

as in the general discussion, for r < 1 not all homogenous polynomials ai give rise by
using (2.35) to top components of chiral superelds in the spacetime theory. the constraint

(2.21) implies that only those with

ri + r  1 > 0

(2.37)

give rise to such operators. the rest of the ai give bottom components of antichiral
superelds.

similarly, (2.18) gives rise to a chiral operator with r-charge ri/r (see (2.28)).

3. the dual theory

3.1. the dynamics near a singularity

consider type ii string theory on the manifold ird1,1  x 2n, where x 2n is a cy
n-fold. if x 2n is smooth, the theory becomes free in the limit gs  0. if however x 2n
contains an isolated singular point, y0, one expects in general to nd in this limit a theory
with a scale ls describing modes localized in the vicinity of y0. to study the dynamics near
the singularity, it is sucient to consider the part of the original compact manifold which
is close to y0, and to replace x 2n by an appropriate non-compact manifold x 2n with the
same singularity. the non-compactness of x 2n also allows one to consider singularities
that cannot be embedded in a compact cy manifold x 2n.

8 ai are arbitrary quasi-homogenous polynomials, dened modulo the equations of motion,

za f (za) = 0.

10

a well-known example with d = 6 is obtained by taking x 2n to be a k3 manifold
with an ade singularity. in the vicinity of the singular point, the k3 can be replaced by
an appropriate non-compact ale space. in the limit gs  0 bulk string theory decouples,
and one is left with a non-local theory without gravity with a scale ls [3]9. while only
ade singularities of some xed nite order can be embedded in a compact k3, the non-

compactness of an ale space allows one to consider all ade singularities.

we next list a few properties of these decoupled theories. we focus on the special case

of quasi-homogenous hypersurface singularities (see [23] for a recent discussion), although

it is probably possible to generalize the discussion to other cases. thus, we take the non-
compact cy manifold x 2n describing the vicinity of the singularity to be the hypersurface
f (z1,    , zn+1) = 0 in cn+1, where f is a polynomial which transforms as f  f under

za  ra za ,

(3.1)

as in (2.30). the point za = 0 is a singular point in x 2n and one expects to nd a
decoupled theory living in its vicinity in the limit gs  0. isometries of x 2n give rise to
symmetries of this theory. in particular, the hypersurface f (za) = 0 has a u (1) symmetry
which acts as (3.1) with || = 1. the holomorphic n-form  on x 2n,

 =

dz1  . . .  dzn

f/zn+1

,

(3.2)

has charge r = pa ra  1 under this symmetry. if r 6= 0, this u (1) symmetry is an r-
symmetry. indeed, since one can write  in terms of a covariantly constant spinor  on x 2n
as i1in = ti1in , the r-charge of the spacetime supercharges is 1/2 that of , i.e.
r/2. moreover, for any hypersurface singularity which occurs at a nite distance in cy
moduli space, r must be positive [23]. since we are interested primarily in singularities
that occur at a nite distance, we will restrict to the case r > 0 below.

the singular hypersurface f (za) = 0 can be deformed to

f (za) +xi

tiai(za) = 0 ,

(3.3)

where ai(za) are quasi-homogenous polynomials with weight ri. in the decoupled theory
near the singularity, ti correspond to couplings of top components of chiral superelds.

9 in fact, [3] considered the decoupling limit gs  0 in string vacua containing coincident

n s5-branes, which are related to ale spaces by t-duality [19,20,21] (see also [22]).

11

from (3.3) we see that the u (1)r charge of ti is 1 ri. the corresponding operator in the
spacetime theory, which we will also denote by ai, thus has charge ri  1. if we normalize
the r-charge so that the supercharges have charge 1, the charge of ai becomes

2(ri  1)

r

.

(3.4)

not all couplings ti can be turned on in this theory. by requiring that the kinetic energy
for ti diverge as za  , so that ti correspond to non-uctuating couplings, [23] found
that only modes that satisfy (2.37) exist in this theory.

3.2. the proposed duality

we propose that the non-gravitational theory describing the dynamics of string theory
on ird1,1  x 2n in the limit gs  0, where x 2n is a non-compact cy n-fold with an
isolated singular point y0, is dual to string theory on ird1,1  ir  n , where n is the
manifold consisting of all points in x 2n at a xed distance from the singular point y0
10.

for the case of hypersurface singularities f (za) = 0 discussed above, the manifold
n can be thought of as n = x 2n/ir+ where ir+ acts on za as (3.1) with   ir+.
this quotient has a residual u (1) action (3.1) with || = 1 which is the u (1)r symmetry
discussed above. n /u (1)  x 2n/c is the n1 complex dimensional hypersurface f (za) =
0 in the n dimensional weighted projective space w cp n

r1,...,rn+1 .

is the manifold n described above a good background for string propagation? as
discussed in section 2, for this to be the case the non-linear sigma-model on n /u (1)
must be (2, 2) superconformal. one way to think about this issue is to embed this non-

linear sigma model in a gauged linear sigma-model following [24]. one studies a (2, 2)
supersymmetric u (1) gauge theory with matter elds za (a = 1,    , n + 1) with charges
ra and an additional eld p with charge 1. the gauge invariant superpotential is taken
to be

w = p f (za) .

(3.5)

since the gauge group is abelian, one can add to the lagrangian a fayet-iliopoulos d-

term, r. classically, when r is large and positive the low energy dynamics of the linear
sigma model corresponds to the non-linear sigma-model on n /u (1), and r can be thought
10 more precisely, as we will see below, the string background involves the worldsheet cft to

which the sigma model on n ows in the ir.

12

of as the size of the space (a kahler modulus). when r is large and negative one nds a
lg model11 with w = f [24].

quantum mechanically, the behavior of the theory depends on the sum of the gauge

charges of the matter elds [24]. when this sum vanishes, the quantum picture is closely

related to the classical one: r remains a modulus in the quantum theory (i.e. it is truly
marginal), and changing this modulus between  and  interpolates between lg theory
and the non-linear sigma-model. thus, in this case both are conformal, and provide

dierent descriptions of a single moduli space of cfts.

when the sum of the charges is non-zero, there are logarithmic corrections to r at one

loop. thus, there is a -function for r and it ows as we change the scale. when the sum

of the charges is positive, r decreases as we go to longer distances, and vice-versa. the

detailed rg ows in this case have not been analyzed, to our knowledge.

in our case, the sum of the gauge charges is r = pa ra  1 and, as we saw before,
it is positive. thus, one expects the kahler modulus r of the hypersurface n /u (1) to
decrease with increasing scale, and presumably go to r =  at long distances. it is then
natural to expect that the infrared xed point of the non-linear sigma-model on n /u (1)
is the infrared limit of the lg theory with superpotential w = f discussed in section 2

(2.29) (we will denote it below by lg(w = f )). therefore, the duality proposed in the
beginning of this subsection involves in this case the background ird1,1  ir n , where
n is roughly s1  lg(w = f ). as mentioned before, the product here may not be direct,
i.e. there may be a correlation between the quantum numbers of operators in s1 and in

lg(w = f ).

the duality proposed here is very reminiscent of the old matrix model [13]. there,
one considers quantum mechanics of n  n hermitian matrices in a potential v (m ) in
the large n limit. the lagrangian is

l = tr(cid:18) 1

2

m 2  v (m )(cid:19) .

(3.6)

for generic v the dynamics depends sensitively on the detailed structure of v . however,

one can ne tune the couplings in v and approach a codimension one surface in coupling

space along which the dynamics described by (3.6) is singular. the physics near this

11 more precisely, this is an orbifold of the above lg model, which here is implemented by the

gso projection.

13

singularity is universal (i.e. independent of the detailed structure of v ), and for the purpose

of studying it one can replace v by an inverted harmonic oscillator potential.

in the double scaling limit n is taken to innity while approaching the singular surface

in coupling space, keeping a dimensionful parameter which measures the distance from

the singularity xed. this limit leads to a non-trivial theory. green functions of u (n )

invariant observables have non-trivial 1/n expansions and one can attempt to study non-

perturbative eects in 1/n as well. as described in [13], these green functions have an

alternative description as s-matrix elements in a 1 + 1 dimensional string theory of a scalar

eld and the liouville eld . the 1/n expansion in the double scaled matrix model is

equivalent to the genus expansion of this string theory. the dilaton is linear in , and the

dimensionful parameter which measures the distance (in coupling space) of (3.6) from the

singularity becomes the worldsheet cosmological constant.

our construction is very similar. string theory on ird1,1  x 2n is the analog of
the matrix qm (3.6).
in particular, it contains a lot of non-universal information.
approaching a point in cy moduli space where x 2n develops a singularity is analogous
to tuning the couplings in the potential v to the singular surface. replacing x 2n by x 2n

is the analog of replacing a general v near the critical surface by the inverted harmonic
oscillator potential. the limit gs  0 in string theory on ird1,1  x 2n is the analog of the
limit n   in the matrix model. finally, the non-critical superstring on ird1,1irn
(2.1) is the analog of 1 + 1 dimensional string theory with a linear dilaton.

the analog of turning on the worldsheet cosmological constant in our case should be
taking the limit gs  0 for a slightly resolved singularity, as in (3.3). indeed, we will see
below that in some cases one can deform the singularity from f (za) = 0 to f (za) = ,

and  becomes the non-critical superstring cosmological constant discussed in [6], which

prevents the system from running to strong coupling.

we next list a few simple checks of the proposed duality:

(1) the symmetry structure seems to agree. both models have 2

d

2 +1 supercharges and a

u (1)r symmetry.

(2) the parameter r dened by (2.32) plays an important role in both models, and must
in string theory on ird1,1  ir  s1  lg(w = f ) this is
be positive in both.
due to (2.34), while in ird1,1  x 2n it is due (for example) to the requirement that
the singularity be at a nite distance in moduli space of cy manifolds [23]. in both
theories the physics changes at r = 1 (q2 = 2).

14

(3) agreement of the chiral rings: we saw that deformations ai of the polynomial f (3.3)
give rise to chiral superelds whose top components have r-charge 2(ri  1)/r. in
the theory near the singularity on x 2n the r-charge is given by (3.4), while in the
(2.36)12. furthermore, in both approaches it was

linear dilaton vacuum it is eq.

found that only deformations that satisfy (2.37) are allowed. in both descriptions,

the origin of this constraint is the requirement that the corresponding coupling be
non-normalizable as   .

4. some special cases

4.1. two dimensional models (d = 2)

in this case, the duality proposed in the previous section relates the following models

with four supercharges in 1 + 1 dimensions:

(1) type ii string theory on

ir1,1  ir  s1  lg(w = f ) ,

(4.1)

where the lg superpotential is w = f (z1,    , z5).

(2) type ii string theory on ir1,1  x 8 in the limit gs  0, where x 8 is the singular cy

fourfold f (z1,    , z5) = 0.

for type iia, models (1) and (2) have (2, 2) supersymmetry in 1 + 1 dimensions. for iib

they have chiral (4, 0) supersymmetry.

in some cases, one can think of theory (2) as a theory on an n s5-brane, making the

connection to [3,1] more apparent. for example, if we take

f (z1,    , z5) = h(z1, z2, z3) + z2

4 + z2
5 ,

(4.2)

where h(z1, z2, z3) describes an ade singularity or a deformation thereof, theory (2) above
can be thought of as the decoupled theory on a curved n s5-brane whose worldvolume is
ir1,1  l4, where l4 is the hypersurface h(z1, z2, z3) = 0 in c3 [23]. this follows13 from a
straightforward generalization of the arguments of [19]. because of the usual chirality ip

12 the r-charge given in (2.36) appears to be too small by a factor of two. the total r-charge
receives a contribution from the other worldsheet chirality. the operators (2.35) are left-right

symmetric; hence, the total r-charge found in section 2 is 2(ri  1)/r, in agreement with (3.4).

13 we thank k. hori and h. ooguri for pointing this out to us.

15

between vebranes and singular geometries (which is essentially due to t-duality), theories

(1) and (2) in type iia are related to n s5-branes in iib, and vice versa.

in theory (2), one can add p fundamental strings at the singular point in x 8, za = 0.
in type iia this does not break any further supersymmetry, while in iib it breaks (4, 0)

supersymmetry to (2, 0). in the infrared, the resulting theory will generically approach

a non-trivial (2, 2) or (2, 0) superconformal xed point. it is natural to expect that the
description of this xed point in the dual theory (1) is obtained by replacing ir1,1  ir
in (4.1) by ads3, and studying string theory on

ads3  s1  lg .

(4.3)

this seems to be consistent with recent work on the ads/cft correspondence for branes

at singularities [25,26,27,28,7].

the class of vacua (4.3) was recently discussed in [8,9] who showed that the spacetime

theory indeed has n = 2 superconformal symmetry. the spacetime central charge of these

vacua is [10,29,30]

cspacetime = 6kp ,

(4.4)

where k is the radius of curvature of ads3, or equivalently the level of the sl(2) current

algebra on the worldsheet of the string, and p the number of strings. equation (4.4) is

valid for all k and to leading order in 1/p.

by comparing the worldsheet central charge of the linear dilaton vacuum (2.3) to that

of ads3, one nds that k is related to the parameters q, r as follows:

1
k

=

q2
2

= r .

(4.5)

in sections 2,3 we saw that the physics of non-critical superstrings depends on whether

r is larger or smaller than one. it is interesting to note that string theory on ads3 also

undergoes a kind of phase transition at the point k = r = 1. as discussed in [31] (see also
[30]), string theory on ads3 has a set of excitations corresponding to long strings living at

the boundary of ads3. the energy gap for the system to emit one of these strings is nite,
and it goes to zero as k  1. excitations of long strings form a continuum above the gap.
a related fact is that these long strings become critical at k = 1. for k > 1 their string

coupling grows as one approaches the boundary of ads3, while for k < 1 it goes to zero

there [31].

16

it would be interesting to understand better the relation between the phase transitions

observed in the linear dilaton, singular cy and ads3 systems.

the analysis of excitations performed for the linear dilaton vacuum in section 2 can

be repeated for ads3. for example, the analogs of the observables (2.15) in this case are

e eiqy v h ,

(4.6)

where h is a primary of sl(2) in the spin j = h  1 representation; its spacetime scaling
dimension is h (see [30] for a more detailed discussion). the physical state constraints in

this case are

h(h  1)

1
q2 
2
qv  qq  2z + 1 .

+ v =

k

1
2

,

(4.7)

chiral operators under the spacetime n = 2 superconformal algebra have scaling dimension
h equal to one half their r-charge14 (2.12). thus we set

plugging in (4.7) we nd

h = |q|
q

= |q|r k

2

.

h
k

+ v =

.

taking v to be a chiral operator with v = qv /2 as before, we nd that

h =

k
2

(1  qv ) .

(4.8)

(4.9)

(4.10)

the second equation in (4.7) together with (4.8) then implies that q is negative, and
h = q/q. thus, the operator we found is a bottom component of an antichiral supereld.
in string theory on ads3 only operators h with h > 1/2 exist15. imposing this in (4.10)
leads to the constraint on charges

qv +

1
k  1 < 0 ,

(4.11)

14 as shown in [8,9], (2.12) is the zero mode of the spacetime u (1) current that is part of the

spacetime n = 2 superconformal algebra.

15 the scaling dimension of h and 1h is h(h  1)/k. h with h > 1/2 is physical, while
the other solution is related to it by an integral transform [32], whose convergence requires that

h > 1/2. an alternative way to see that only h > 1/2 gives rise to non-normalizable observables

is to study the behavior of the wavefunction h at the boundary of ads3, as done in [30].

17

which is nothing but the constraint (2.25) found for the corresponding operators in the

linear dilaton background.

to nd analogs of (2.22) in ads3, we require that the bottom component of the

spacetime supereld whose top component corresponds to (4.6) be chiral; this implies

1
2

h 

=

plugging in (4.7) leads to

h = 1 +

k
2

(qv  1) .

(4.12)

(4.13)

this is the dimension of the top component of the supereld. the dimension of the bottom

component (which corresponds to a rr vertex operator) is

hbottom =

1
2

+

k
2

(qv  1) ,

and the constraint that in (4.13) h > 1/2, or equivalently that hbottom > 0,

qv +

1
k  1 > 0 ,

(4.14)

(4.15)

is the same as the constraint (2.21) satised by (2.22).

therefore, we see that there is a nice correspondence between the spectrum of oper-

ators in the non-conformal linear dilaton background (4.1), and its conformal low energy

limit (4.3). in fact, as we discuss in the appendix, one can construct string backgrounds
which interpolate between a linear dilaton vacuum for    and ads3 for   ,
which makes this correspondence natural.

we conclude this subsection with an example. take

f (z1,    , z5) = zn

3 + z2

4 + z2
5 ,

1 + z2

2 + z2

(4.16)

which corresponds to an an1 singularity in (4.2). the weights ra are: r1 = 1/n, r2 =
r3 = r4 = r5 = 1/2. hence, r (2.32) is given by

r = 1 +

1
n

=

n + 1

n

.

(4.17)

note that in this case r is always bigger than one, so the subtleties of r < 1 discussed
in sections 2,3 are never encountered. the spacetime central charge (4.4) is

cspacetime = 6(1 

1

n + 1

)p .

18

(4.18)

the chiral operators ai (3.3) corresponding to resolutions of the singularity are ai = zi
1,
i = 0, 1, 2,    , n  2. their u (1)r charges are qai = i/n. plugging into (4.14) we nd
chiral operators with spacetime scaling dimensions

hi =

i + 1

2(n + 1)

,

i = 0, 1,    , n  2 .

(4.19)

this spectrum looks like that corresponding to an n = 2 minimal model with superpoten-
tial n+1. the central charge (4.18) is also suggestive of that. indeed, if we could trust

(4.18) for p = 1 (which is far from obvious), it would be natural to expect that in the

spacetime scft with central charge

cspacetime = 6(1 

1

n + 1

) = (cid:20)3 

6

n + 1(cid:21) + 3 ,

(4.20)

the contribution in square brackets comes from an n = 2 minimal model with the above

superpotential. for large p, (4.18) might describe a (deformation of a) symmetric product

of such minimal models, each coupled to a c = 3 system.

it would be interesting to

understand to what extent this is true, and what is the role of the c = 3 piece of the

spacetime cft.

a system closely related to ours was recently discussed in [23], who however set p to

zero and instead turned on some discrete rr backgrounds that are dicult to analyze in

our formalism. interestingly, in the simplest case it was found in [23] that the spacetime
scft corresponding to (4.16) is an n = 2 minimal model with superpotential n+1

and the result (4.19) for the dimensions of chiral operators was obtained as well. this is

encouraging, since our analysis is reliable at large p, while that of [23] works for small p;

it would be interesting to understand the relation between the two.

returning to the linear dilaton vacuum with p = 0, the example (4.16) allows us

to demonstrate another point that was briey mentioned above. in the non-critical su-
perstring construction, the string coupling diverges as   .
n s5-brane discussed in [1] the strong coupling singularity is avoided in a way that can-

in the theory of the

not be understood in string perturbation theory. thus, the linear dilaton description has

limited utility; e.g. it cannot be used for computing correlation functions.

in our case, the situation is the following.

if we are studying the singular theory,
i.e. take x 8 to be the manifold f (z1,    , z5) = 0, where f is given by (4.16), the dual
description again involves an innite throat with innite coupling down the throat, and
perturbatively nothing stops the theory from running to   . the singularity is again

19

avoided non-perturbatively. however, we can resolve the singularity f = 0 to f = , by

turning on the operator a0 = 1 in (3.3). in the non-critical superstring this corresponds

to adding to the worldsheet lagrangian the operator (2.35) with ai = 1. this is precisely
the operator used in [6] to cut o the strong coupling singularity at   . after the
resolution, string perturbation theory is well dened, and can be used reliably to calculate

correlation functions.

as discussed in section 3, all this is very reminiscent of the old matrix model [13].

the case of the unresolved singularity f = 0 corresponds to vanishing cosmological con-

stant in liouville theory (or, equivalently, vanishing condensate of the tachyon eld in

1 + 1 dimensional string theory), which is a singular limit, at least perturbatively. the re-

solved system f =  corresponds to nite cosmological constant and much of the intuition
developed in 1 + 1 dimensional string theory is applicable here16.

note also that for p 6= 0, using the result (4.19) for the dimensions of chiral operators,
we see that a0 = 1 corresponds to an operator with scaling dimension h0 = 1
2(n+1) in the
low energy spacetime cft. thus, the spacetime superpotential n+1 is deformed for nite
 to w = n+1 +, which indeed completely resolves the n-fold singularity at  = 0. this

is consistent with the fact that the non-critical superstring with nite n = 2 cosmological

constant does not appear to describe a non-trivial spacetime cft in the infrared.

one can also study rg ows in the boundary theory, by adding relevant deformations

to f , as in (3.3). this leads to a picture like that of [33]. the general relevant perturbation

of the worldsheet superpotential (4.16) is

f (z1,    , z5) = zn

1 +  +

n2

xi=1

izi

1 + z2

5 ;

(4.21)

 sets the scale, and as in [13] it can be scaled to one. the i can then be thought of as

dimensionful couplings that ow with the scale. the ow can be considered either as a

function of  or as a function of . for large , or equivalently large , the i are eectively
small and the theory approaches the one with i = 0. for   , or equivalently   0,
the i grow and the system generically splits into a set of decoupled vacua with n = 2 in

(4.16). by tuning the i one can reach a large collection of multicritical points (see [33]

for a more detailed discussion).

16 of course, unlike [13], one does not expect the full string theory in non-critical superstring

vacua to be exactly solvable.

20

4.2. four dimensional models (d = 4)

the duality of section 3 relates in this case the following n = 2 supersymmetric

theories in 3 + 1 dimensions: type ii string theory on

ir3,1  ir  s1  lg(w = f (z1,    , z4))

and type ii string theory on

ir3,1  x 6

in the limit gs  0. x 6 is the singular cy manifold f (z1,    , z4) = 0.

a simple example is

f = z2

1 + z2

2 + z2

3 + z2
4 ,

(4.22)

(4.23)

(4.24)

for which x 6 is the conifold [34].

r = 1 in this case, and the lg factor in (4.22)

degenerates.

more generally, if

f (z1,    , z4) = h(z1, z2) + z2

3 + z2
4 ,

(4.25)

we can think of the theory on (4.23) as the worldvolume theory on an n s5-brane wrapped

around the riemann surface h(z1, z2) = 0 [35]. such vebranes are relevant for describing
n = 2 sym theories using branes [11,12].

for example, to study n s5-branes wrapped around the seiberg-witten curve at an

argyres-douglas point [36,37,38], one can choose h in (4.25) to describe an ade singu-

larity

(4.26)




for d = 4, n = 3 (1.1), and plugging in (2.33) gives cw = 6(1  r). since cw  0, this
implies that r  1. therefore, in these examples one typically encounters the obstructions
discussed in sections 2,3 to turning on various perturbations that resolve the singularities.

for the an1 singularity (4.26) r = 1

1 (i =
n , give rise to deformations of the singularity only when (2.37)

2 . perturbations of the form zi

n + 1

0, 1,    , n  2), with ri = i
holds, i.e. for

i >

n
2  1 .

(4.27)

therefore, an an1 singularity cannot be completely resolved.

21

a possible explanation of (4.27) in the vebrane theory is the following. at low energy,
the theory of the n s5-brane wrapped around the riemann surface h(z1, z2) = 0 ows to
a four dimensional n = 2 scft [36,37,38]. such theories have a global u (1)r  su (2)r
symmetry. dimensions of chiral operators are related to the u (1)r charge r and su (2)r
spin i via

d = 2i +

.

(4.28)

r
2

i + 2
n + 2

if the u (1)r symmetry which becomes part of the n = 2 superconformal algebra in the
ir can be identied at high energies, one can use (4.28) to determine the dimensions of

chiral operators.

in our case, the high energy theory has a u (1)r symmetry r + r (2.12), and it is
natural to expect this symmetry to become the u (1)r part of the global symmetry of the
ir scft. the deformations zi
1 discussed above have i = 0, hence their scaling dimensions
in the low energy scft are di = 1
n and
q2 = 2r = n+2
n ) we nd that the dimension of the bottom component of the supereld
zi
1 is

2 (ri + ri) = ri. using (2.23) (with qzi

= ri = i

1

di = 2

(4.29)
all scaling dimensions in a unitary four dimensional cft satisfy d  1. imposing this
requirement on (4.29) leads to (4.27) (for i = n
2 1, di = 1 and the corresponding operator
is a decoupled free eld).

i = 0, 1,    , n  2 .

,

as explained in section 2, operators zi

1 which do not satisfy (4.27) give rise via (2.24)
to bottom components of antichiral superelds. since q2 = 2r satises 1 < q2 < 2,
these superelds are relevant. their top components can be added to the worldsheet

lagrangian to eliminate the strong coupling singularity, however, they do not correspond
to new deformations of h (4.26). one can show17 that the top component of the antichiral
supereld whose bottom component is (2.24) with v = zi
1 is the complex conjugate of (2.22)
with v = zn2i

.

1

a similar analysis can be performed for the d, e series curves in (4.26). equation

(4.29) takes in general the form

di = 2

ei + 1
h + 2

,

(4.30)

where h is the dual coxeter number of the corresponding algebra and ei are its dynkin
exponents [36,37,38].

17 more generally, for d = 4 one can show that the worldsheet chiral ring of lg(w = f ) splits
into two components of equal size: operators that satisfy (2.37) and those that do not. the two
groups are related by spectral ow. this implies that the size of the spacetime chiral ring is half
of what one might naively expect.

22

4.3. six dimensional models (d = 6)

in this case, the duality of section 3 relates type ii string theory on

ir5,1  ir  s1  lg(w = f (z1, z2, z3))

and type ii string theory on

ir5,1  x 4

(4.31)

(4.32)

in the limit gs  0. x 4 is the singular manifold f (z1, z2, z3) = 0. the models (4.31)
and (4.32) have sixteen real supercharges. in the type iia theory they form a non-chiral

(1, 1) supersymmetry algebra in 5 + 1 dimensions, while in type iib one nds chiral (2, 0)

supersymmetry.

the worldsheet central charge of the lg model in (4.31) is (2.33)

cw = 3  6r .

(4.33)

for positive r this central charge is smaller than three. all unitary n = 2 scfts with
central charge c < 3 have been classied. they correspond to n = 2 minimal models and

are in one to one correspondence with ade singularities. one way of describing them is

as infrared xed points of lg models with superpotential

f (z1, z2, z3) = h(z1, z2) + z2

3 ,

(4.34)

where h(z1, z2) is given in eq. (4.26). the manifold x 4 (4.32) f (z1, z2, z3) = 0 is an ale
space corresponding to the appropriate ade singularity.

in this case our proposal reduces to that of [1], where it was argued that the decoupled

theory on ir5,1  ale is holographically related to string theory on

ir5,1  ir  s3 .

(4.35)

at rst sight this appears to be dierent from the background (4.31), but the two are in

fact related as follows.

the worldsheet cft on s3 is described by an su (2) wzw model associated with the
ade singularity corresponding to x 4. the n = 2 minimal models lg(w = f ) in (4.31)

can be described as the coset scfts su (2)/u (1). one can decompose su (2) wzw
theory under u (1)  su (2)/u (1) [39]. the gso projection xes the radius of the u (1)

23

and acts as an orbifold on u (1)  su (2)/u (1); this orbifold is equivalent by t duality to
su (2) wzw cft [40], in agreement with (4.35).

the perturbations zi

1 are relevant on the worldsheet but none of them are relevant in
spacetime. indeed, since q2 = 2r = 2/n, the condition (2.27) implies that qzi
= i/n >
1  (2/n), or i > n  2, outside the range of available perturbations. thus, we recover the
conclusion of [2,1] that in this case there are no relevant deformations that can be turned
on that eliminate the strong coupling singularity at  =  perturbatively.

1

it should be mentioned for completeness that there is in fact a known way to eliminate

the strong coupling singularity both in (4.31), and more generally in all vacua of the form
ird1,1  ir  s1 n /u (1). ir s1 is an innite cylinder; the dilaton grows as one goes
down the cylinder. one can eliminate the strong coupling region by changing the topology

of the cylinder to the semi-innite cigar, which can be described by cft on sl(2)/u (1)

[41].

the string coupling on the cigar is bounded and, in principle, one should be able to

study the theory using worldsheet methods. since observables are exponentially supported

far from the tip of the cigar, where the space looks like a cylinder, much of our discussion

above applies to this geometry. to compute correlation functions it is important to take

into account scattering from the tip of the cigar. this can be done using results on cft

on euclidean ads3 (the coset sl(2, c)/su (2)) and coset cft techniques.

for example, string theory on

sl(2)
u (1) 

su (2)
u (1)  ir5,1

(4.36)

is a vacuum with sixteen supercharges which looks asymptotically like (4.31), however,
unlike (4.31), it should be a weakly coupled theory18. according to [42], (4.36) is related

to rotating n s5-branes.

18 the symmetry structure of this vacuum is discussed in appendix b of [10].

note added: string propagation in the near-horizon geometry of cy manifolds with

hypersurface singularities was also studied in [43,19]. the relation of our work to these

papers is discussed in [44].

appendix a. interpolating between linear dilaton and ads3 vacua

in the text we mentioned the fact that the two dimensional linear dilaton ir1,1  ir
and ads3 vacua are closely related. we also mentioned that there are solutions which

interpolate between the two.

in this appendix we construct such solutions. while the

construction is general, we present it for the special case of vacua of the form

m3  s3  t 4 ,

(a.1)

where m3 interpolates between ir1,1  ir for    and ads3 for   . we will
rst describe the solution in supergravity, and then the corresponding exact worldsheet

cft.

consider a conguration of k n s5-branes wrapped on a four-torus of volume vl4
s,
parametrized by the coordinates xi, i = 1, 2, 3, 4. in the remaining non-compact dimensions

the vebranes look like k strings whose worldsheet is the (, ) plane. one can add to this

conguration p fundamental strings parallel to the vebranes (i.e. extended in (, ) as

well). the metric, dilaton and n s b eld for this conguration of branes, with the p

strings smeared over the four-torus, are [2,45,46]:

ds2 = f 1

(a.3)

at weak coupling the vebranes are much heavier than the strings and thus they give rise
to a larger distortion of the geometry around them (i.e. typically r1  r5). therefore, it
makes sense to study an intermediate region in the background (a.2) where one is in the

near-horizon geometry of the vebranes but not necessarily of the strings. as is clear from
(a.3), this is the region r  r5. in this limit, the geometry has the form (a.1), where the
three dimensional manifold m3 is described by:

f1  1 (a.3) and m3 looks like at space with a linear dilaton, ir1,1ir. for r  r1 one
is in the near-horizon geometry of both the strings and the vebranes and m3 becomes
the familiar ads3 solution:

3/r2

(a.6)

therefore, (a.1) interpolates between the linear dilaton and ads3 vacua.

db = 2ik3 = d(cid:2)ike2d  d(cid:3) .

while the above discussion took place in supergravity, one can show that the back-

ground (a.4) in fact gives rise to an exact solution of the (classical) string equations of

motion, i.e. to a worldsheet cft with the right properties. this cft can be constructed

as a perturbation of cft on ads3. we next briey review that construction.

cft on ads3 has an sl(2)  sl(2) current algebra. one of the null holomorphic
currents, j, and its (anti-holomorphic) complex conjugate, j, can be written semiclassically
as

j  e2 ,

j  e2  .

26

(a.7)

the operator j j is exactly marginal in cft on ads3. adding this perturbation to the
ads3 background with a nite coecient, along the lines of [47,48], gives rise to a one
parameter family of sigma models with lagrangian [49]

1

2 (cid:18)k  +

k

gr(2){log[e2(1 + e2)1] + const} .

(a.8)

for  = 1/k the sigma model (a.8) is identical to the background (a.4),(a.5). thus, the
background m3 corresponding to (a.4) is an exact cft with c = 3 + 6/k.
