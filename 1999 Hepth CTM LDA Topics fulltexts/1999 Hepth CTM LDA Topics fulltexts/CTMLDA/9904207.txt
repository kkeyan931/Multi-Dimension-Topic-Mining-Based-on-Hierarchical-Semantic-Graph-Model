(b) (a) (c) (d) d-brane d-brane figure 2: open strings living coincident d-brane anti-d-brane pair. although clarity displayed brane anti-brane spatially separated, shall analyse case coincide. next shall review properties coincident d-brane d-brane pair shown fig.2. follows: 5 spectrum open strings living world-volume contains four dierent sectors. four sectors labelled 2 2 chan paton (cp) factors: (b) : (d) : (cid:18) 1 0 0 0(cid:19) (cid:18) 0 1 0 0(cid:19) . (a) : (c) : 0 0 (cid:18) 0 1(cid:19) , (cid:18) 0 0 1 0(cid:19) , (2.1) gso projection: physical states sectors (a) (b) (1)f = 1 whereas sectors (c) (d) (1)f = 1. f denotes world-sheet fermion number carried state. use convention (1)f eigenvalue neveu-schwarz (ns) sector ground state 1. gso projection rule follows observation closed string exchange interaction d-brane d-brane pair d-branes sign nsns sector closed string exchange opposite sign rr sector closed string exchange. open string channel corresponds replacing gso projection operator 1+(1)f strings. dd strings 1(1)f 2 2 since ns sector ground state (1)f = 1, survives gso projection sectors (c) (d) gives tachyonic excitations with m2 = (1/2) . (2.2) since tachyon comes two dierent sectors complex scalar eld. although individually d-brane well d-brane invariant half space-time supersymmetry transformations, combined system breaks supersymmetries. shall study action (1)fl coincident d-brane d-brane system, fl denotes contribution space-time fermion number left-moving sector string world-sheet. (1)fl known exact symmetry type iia type iib string theories. acting closed string hilbert space, changes sign states left-moving ramond sector, change anything else. thus trivial action world-sheet elds. denition follows space-time elds originating ramond-ramond (rr) sector world-sheet 6 change sign (1)fl. since d-branes charged rr eld, follows (1)fl must take d-brane d-brane. thus single d-brane single d-brane invariant (1)fl, coincident d-brane d-brane system invariant (1)fl. hence makes sense study action (1)fl open strings living system, shall now. begin observation since (1)fl action world-sheet elds, need study action cp factors.2 since (1)fl exchanges d-brane d-brane, acts cp matrix 1(1)1 , 1 = (cid:18) 0 1 1 0(cid:19) . (2.3) (2.4) shows states cp factors 1 even (1)fl, whereas cp factors 3 i2 odd. (we could replace 1 2 (2.3), amounts change convention.) 2.2 non-bps d-branes type ii string theories ready dene non-bps d-2p-brane type iib string theory{$9812031$}. done following steps listed below. start d-2p d-2p-brane pair type iia string theory take orbifold conguration (1)fl. bulk, modding iia (1)fl gives iib. acting open strings living d- d-brane world-volume, (1)fl projection keeps states cp factors 1 throws states cp factors 3 i2. denes non-bps d-2p-brane type iib string theory. order see describes single object rather pair objects, simply note projection degree freedom separating two branes reside sector 2we shall focus attention ns-sector states, similar analysis done separately r-sector states. 7 cp factor 3. since states cp sector 3 projected out, lose degree freedom separating brane antibrane pair away other. similarly, starting d-(2p + 1)-brane d-(2p + 1)-brane pair iib, modding (1)fl, dene non-bps (2p + 1)-brane iia. thus type iib string theory contains bps d-branes odd dimension non-bps d-branes even dimension, whereas type iia string theory contains bps d-branes even dimension non-bps d-branes odd dimension. let us list properties non-bps d-2p-brane type iib string theory. (similar results also hold non-bps d-(2p + 1)-brane type iia string theory.) properties follow denition, properties coincident brane- antibrane pair reviewed earlier. excitations world-volume open strings dirichlet boundary condition (9 2p) transverse directions, neumann boundary condition 2p + 1 tangential directions (including time). open strings carry chan paton factors 1. physical states cp factor (1)f = 1 physical states cp factor 1 (1)f = 1. (note f denotes world-sheet fermion number.) ns sector ground state carrying cp factor 1 (1)f = 1 hence physical. thus tachyonic mode m2 = 1 2 . since tachyon comes one sector, real scalar eld. tension non-bps d-2p-brane type iib string theory given by: (2)2p(2/g) , (2.5) (2.6) g denotes coupling constant string theory. property derived taking account eect modding (1)fl, fact original brane-antibrane system (1)fl modding tension equal (2)2p(2/g) . 8 (2.7) similarly, tension non-bps d-(2p + 1)-brane type iia string theory given (2)(2p+1)(2/g) . (2.8) one also derive spectrum open strings one end non-bps brane end bps brane, shall discuss here. 2.3 bps d-branes non-bps d-branes let us consider eect modding non-bps d-2p-brane iib (1)fl, (1)fl denotes corresponding symmetry type iib string theory{$9812031$}. bulk, modding type iib string theory (1)fl gives us back type iia string theory. question shall interested is: happens d-2p-brane modding? question makes sense non-bps d-brane carry rr charge hence invariant action (1)fl. order answer question need study action (1)fl open string states living d-2p-brane. (1)fl act world-sheet elds, acts cp factors. thus need nd action (1)fl cp factors. done help following observations:3 graviton open string cp factor figure 3: disk amplitude two point function graviton translation mode d-brane. 3for deniteness shall focus attention ns sector states, similar analysis also carried r sector states. 9 non-zero two point function graviton gm closed string sector translation modes x d-2p-brane originating cp sector form: gmx , (2.9) denotes direction transverse brane , denote directions tangential brane. coupling follows expanding dirac-born- infeld action brane world-volume around conguration brane space-time background. also seen computing disk amplitude graviton vertex operator inserted center disk, tachyon vertex operator inserted boundary disk, shown fig.3.4 since graviton even (1)fl, shows states cp factor must also even (1)fl. rr field open string cp factor 1 figure 4: disk amplitude two point function tachyon rr sector 2p-form gauge eld. dotted line denotes (1)fl cut extending rr vertex operator disk boundary. non-zero two point function rr-sector 2p-form gauge eld a(2p) closed string sector tachyonic mode d-2p-brane originating 4this mean physical on-shell scalar particle brane nite transition probability graviton state bulk. disallowed due various kinematic reasons. however, existence coupling (2.9) still deduced evaluation disk amplitude region unphysical (complex) external momenta; done e.g. deducing yang-mills three gauge boson vertex three string amplitude{$9805019$}. 10 cp sector 1 form: z a(2p) dt . (2.10) seen computing disk amplitude rr-sector gauge eld vertex operator inserted center disk, tachyon vertex operator inserted boundary, shown fig.4.5 fact amplitude non- zero may seem surprising, tachyon vertex operator carries cp factor 1, seems cp factor inserted boundary disk. however, since rr sector states type iib string theory appear twisted sector regard type iib string theory type iia string theory modded (1)fl, cut extending rr sector vertex operator center way boundary disk. point cut hits boundary need insert extra factor 1, since (1)fl action cp factors correspond conjugation 1. gives total two factors 1 disk boundary makes amplitude non-vanishing. follows since rr-sector elds odd (1)fl, states cp factor 1 also odd (1)fl. net result analysis states cp factor (1)fl even states cp factor 1 (1)fl odd. thus modding (1)fl, states cp factor survive projection. already seen before, gso projection requires states even (1)f . thus spectrum identical open strings living bps d-2p-brane iia, conclude non-bps d-2p-brane type iib string theory, modded (1)fl, gives bps d-2p-brane type iia string theory.6 results section summarized fig.5. also similar relation iia iib (2p) (2p + 1). 5again, before, actual transition massless rr sector state tachyon absent due kinematic reasons. 6note stage cannot determine whether resulting brane d-brane d-brane, carry spectrum open string. reection fact orbifolding procedure two-fold ambiguity, could end either d-brane d-brane following steps. 11 d-2p - anti-d-2p pair iia d-2p iib d-2p iia figure 5: relationship bps non-bps d-branes type ii string theories. horizontal arrow represents eect modding theory (1)fl. 3 stable non-bps d-branes type ii orbifolds orientifolds although constructed non-bps d-branes type iia/iib string theory last section, unstable due presence tachyonic mode. shall discuss section 4, tachyon condenses minimum, conguration indistinguishible vacuum{$9805170$}. thus natural ask: use d-brane? section shall show although unstable type iia/iib string theory, may get stable non-bps d-branes certain orbifolds/orientifolds iia/iib tachyonic mode projected operation. shall illustrate two examples. 3.1 type d-particle let us consider following construction: start non-bps d0-brane (d-particle) type iib dened last section. mod conguration world-sheet parity transformation . result described non-bps d-particle type string theory, since bulk type iib string theory modded gives type string theory. crucial question is: d-particle stable? equivalently may ask: tachyonic mode type iib d-particle odd ? answer question follows eq.(2.10) p = 0, i.e. two point function tachyonic mode 12 d-particle world-volume rr sector scalar eld type iib string theory non- vanishing. since eld known odd , conclude tachyonic mode d-particle also odd . thus projected type string theory. words, type d-particle stable{$9809111$}! spectrum open strings type d-particle also includes open strings one end d-particle end one 32 nine branes present type string theory. ramond sector states sector shown give rise 32 massless fermionic zero modes living d0-brane. quantization zero modes gives rise ground state transforms spinor representation type gauge group so(32). also gives additional explanation stability d-particle. since perturbative states type string theory scalar conjugacy class so(32), since spinor state cannot decay states scalar conjugacy class, d-particle prevented decaying perturbative string states due charge conservation. consider two coincident d-particles type string theory, also possible tachyonic modes coming open strings two ends two dierent d- particles. turns projection remove tachyonic modes sectors, two coincident d-particles describe unstable system. consistent observation two particles spinor representation so(32) combine annihilate perturbative string states, conservation law preventing process. existence type d-particle also relevant testing conjectured duality type heterotic string theory. so(32) heterotic string theory contains states perturbative spectrum transform spinor representation so(32). states massive, non-bps. lightest state belonging spinor representation so(32) stable values coupling, cannot decay anything else. thus states must also exist strong coupling limit so(32) heterotic string theory, nothing weakly coupled type string theory. type d-particles provide explicit realization states. instructive compare mass formulae so(32) spinor states two extreme ranges coupling constant. shall use variables heterotic string theory express mass formula two ends. small heterotic coupling 13 gh, perturbative mass formula heterotic string theory holds: qth (a0 + a1 g2 h + a2 g4 h + . . .) , (3.1) th heterotic string tension, ai numerical coecients. a0 computed tree level heterotic string theory, whereas computed m-loop order. large heterotic coupling use description state type d-particle compute mass. saw earlier, mass order ti/gi, ti gi string tension coupling constant respectively type string theory. using standard relationship heterotic type variables{$9805019$} ti = th g1 h , gi = g1 h , see large gh mass state proportional to: qth(gh)1/2 . (3.2) (3.3) interesting see perturbation expansion (3.1) contains information large gh behaviour given (3.3). 3.2 d-branes wrapped non-supersymmetric cycles k3 orb- ifold section shall discuss another example tachyonic mode non-bps d-brane projected orbifolding operation{$9812031$}. proceed follows: start non-bps d-string type iia string theory wrapped circle along x9 radius r9 placed xi = 0 1 8. compactify three directions x6, x7, x8. mod theory z2 transformation i4 changes sign x6, . . . x9: (3.4) (x6, x7, x8, x9) (x6,x7,x8,x9) . i4 : bulk gives type iia string theory orbifold k3. shall analyze fate tachyon eld d-string orbifold theory. since d-string lies along x9, tachyon eld world-steet function x9 time t. 14 considering two point function tachyon rr sector gauge eld, one show z2 transformation i4, expand (x9, t) fourier mode as: (x9, t) (x9, t) . (x9, t) = xn tn(t)einx9/r9 , tn(t) tn(t) . i4: thus t0 projected out. n 6= 0 combination tn tn survives projection i4. since eective mass2 tn tn given m2 n = (n2/r2 9) (1/2) , see tachyon spectrum 2 . r9 (3.5) (3.6) (3.7) (3.8) (3.9) also possible tachyonic modes open string states stretched original d-string image translation along x6, x7 x8. demanding tachyonic modes sectors also get7 r8 1 2 , r7 1 2 , r6 1 2 . (3.10) net result analysis stable non-bps state type iia string theory 4/i4 range parameters described (3.9), (3.10). next question would be: interpretation state? many ways answer question; shall explain studying physics critical radius r9 = 2. fact one show potential radius t1 massless modes. 7these relations found eq.(3.9) t-duality transformation. 15 9 x =0 d0 9 x = 9 r d0 figure 6: d0- d0 brane conguration obtained marginal deformation non- bps d-string wrapped along x9.
