i. introduction

the born-infeld action was rst proposed by born and infeld [1] as a nite limiting eld

modication of the classical maxwell theory of electromagnetism. it was later generalized

by dirac [2] as an extensible model of electrons, with a profound assumption that dierent

avors, e.g., muon, correspond to membrane excitations coupled to the born-infeld action.

while successive eorts trying to put through a fully quantized version of this classical

theory [3] only receive their revival after d-brane [4] and matrix model [5] [6] revolutions,

the dynamical properties of this theory were largely unexplored. with the advent of d-

brane technology in string theory, the dirac-born-infeld lagrangian has been identied

as the low energy eective theory describing the interactions of massless excitations in the

brane world [7]. in view of this progress, many research papers have focused on the symmetry

properties, e.g., string duality, and qualitative behaviors of d-branes within special kinematic

regions and parameter space. nevertheless, detailed dynamical solutions of this theory

remain illusive. given that the solitonic nature of d-branes in string theory is established

semiclassically, it is prudent to study exact solutions of the classical theory, namely, the

dirac-born-infeld equation, as a rst approximation. hopefully, with either supersymmetry

constraints and/or small quantum corrections, which protect classical analysis from quantum

uctuations, we can uncover certain nonperturbative aspects of string dynamics with these

solutions.

in this paper, i shall focus on a particular class of exact solutions to the dirac-born-

infeld equation, which generalizes previous work by barbashov and chernikov [8] [9] on

the wave solutions to the born-infeld theory. these solutions describe scatterings among

localized wave packets propagating along d-string in a two-dimensional plane under the

inuence of constant background elds, including both a second rank antisymmetric tensor

b and a u(1) gauge eld strength tensor fij. in addition to the study of time evolution

for these scattering events, i also examine the connections between phase shifts and total

energy momentum of the d-string.

2

part of the motivation leads to the present study is tied to the recent discussion on

various connections between dirac-born-infeld theory and uid dynamics [10] [11]. while

the original derivation by barbashov and chernikov is based on geometrical arguments, i

opt for an analytical approach by solving partial dierential equations. in this regard, the

nature of wave solutions is studied purely within a classical eld theoretical context.

this paper is organized as follows: basic properties of the dirac-born-infeld theory,

together with several special solutions are reviewed in sec.

ii. then we solve the dirac-

born-infeld equation with constant background elds of the d-string in sec. iii. after some

discussions about the scattering event and the physical interpretation of phase shifts, we

give summary and conclusion in sec. iv.

ii. basic properties of the dirac-born-infeld equation with

constant background fields

a. general background of the dbi theory

the dirac-born-infeld (dbi) lagrangian for a dp-brane is given by

l = q(1)p det[ g + b + f ]ij,

i, j = 0, 1, ..., p,

where

gij 

x 
xi

x 
xj

g(x),

,  = 0, 1, ....., 9,

is the induced metric on the brane world-volume, and

bij 

x 
xi

x 
xj

b(x),

,  = 0, 1, ....., 9,

(1)

(2)

(3)

describes the interaction of the dp-brane with the antisymmetric tensor eld b(x), which

is generated from the close string spectrum. finally,

fij(x) 

aj
xi 

ai
xj

,

3

i, j = 0, 1, ....., p,

(4)

is a u(1) abelian eld strength tensor, which arises from the open string modes ai on the

dp-brane [12] [13],

a(x)  ai(x) dxi.

(5)

one special feature associated with the dbi action is that it is invariant under general

coordinate transformations,

x
i = x

i(x0, x1, ....., xp),

i = 0, 1, ....., p,

with

such that

dx

j =   x

xk! dxk  jjk dxk,

j

ai = a

j  x

xi!  j t
ija
j,

j

l =  {x0, x1, ...., xp}

1, ...., x

0, x

{x

p}!l  s  = z dp+1x l = z dp+1xj 1 l = z dp+1x l = s.

(6)

(7)

(8)

consequently, the equation of motion associated with the dbi action is reparametrization

invariant.

on the other hand, there are two gauge transformations which leave the dbi lagrangian

invariant,

(i)

ai = i, b = 0

(ii) ai =   x 

 f  = f , b  = b;
xi ! , b =      b  + f  = b + f .

(9)

(10)

in view of these symmetries, not all components of b and fij are independent, and physical

quantities should depend only on the gauge invariant combination b + f .

b. dbi equation for the d-string

in this paper, we shall focus on a special case, where a d-1 brane (or d-string) is moving

within a two-dimensional plane of the nine-dimensional space. that is, we choose the world-

sheet coordinates of the d-string to be

4

x0 = x0 = t,

x1 = x1 = x,

and the prole of the d-string is described by

x2 = x2(x1, x0)  (x, t),
x3 = x4 = ..... = x9 = 0.

in a at space-time metric

g(x) = diag (1, 1, 1, ....., 1),

an expansion of the determinant inside the dbi lagrangian, eq.(1), gives

l = q(1  b2

3)  (1 + b2

1)2

t  2b1b2tx + (1  b2

2)2

x + 2b1b3t + 2b2b3x,

where we have introduced the external eld variables

b1  b12,

b2  b20,

b3  b01 + f01.

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

we shall assume that bi are constants and one can verify that the lagrangian eq.(15) is

invariant under gauge transformations eqs.(9) (10).

if we perform a wick rotation,

t = i,

b1 = ib1,

then the lagrangian becomes

l = q(1  b2

3) + (1  b2

1)2

  2b1b2 x + (1  b2

2)2

x + 2b1b3 + 2b2b3x.

(17)

(18)

from this form, we observe a discrete symmetry associated with the dbi lagrangian of the

d-string in the presence of background elds,

 it  x,

ib1  b2.

(19)

the euler-lagrange equation for the dirac-born-infeld action in the presence of constant

background elds bi for the d-string is given by a second order nonlinear partial dierential

equation,

c. special cases of the dbi equation with constant background elds

before we solve the partial dierential equation for d-string, let us make some simple

observations: if b1 = b2 = 0 and b2

3 < 1, the dbi lagrangian simplies,

l = q(1  b2

x = q1  b2

with

(21)

(22)

consequently, for d-string, a constant u(1) eld strength tensor f01, or, more generally, the

gauge invariant combination, b3  b01 + f01, only contributes to a rescaling of the string
tension and does not aect the dynamics.

on the other hand, b1 = b2 = 0 and b2

3 = 1 constitutes a singular case:

l = q2

t + 2
x.

this lagrangian gives rise to the bateman equation

2
t xx  2xtxt + 2

xtt = 0,

and the general solution is given by

f ()t + g()x =const,

(23)

(24)

(25)

where f and g are two arbitrary functions. see [11] for more discussion on this problem.

finally, let us emphasize the importance of a nonzero b3 in this problem. if b3 = 0, the

dbi lagrangian for d-string reduces to

6

l = q1  (1 + b2

we can transform the dbi lagrangian with b3 = 0 into the nambu-goto form,

l = q1  2

.

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

(30)

consequently, the solutions of dbi equation with b3 = 0 can be generated from solutions

of the nambu-goto equation,

(1  2

x)tt = 0,

with

(x, t) = ( (x, t), (x, t)).

(31)

(32)

d. traveling wave solutions of the dbi equation

since we shall be concerned with wave solutions, it is of interest to check if the dbi

equation in 1 + 1 dimension supports traveling waves. for this purpose, we take a trial

solution (x, t) = f (x  v t) and substitute it into the dbi equation eq.(20). after some
algebra, we get a quadratic equation for v,

several special cases are of interest for later discussions:

2. b2 = 0

3. b1 = b2

(37)

(38)

notice that only the rst case |b3| < 1 satises causality constraint ||,||  1. in
view of this, we shall limit our discussion below with |bi| < 1.

4. b1 = b2

this case amounts to a parity transformation of the above solutions,   ,   .
the constant velocities ,  imply a linear dispersion relation w(k)  const.k for plane
wave solution (t, x; k) = a(k)ei(kxw(k)t) and the fact that the wave frequency w(k) is
independent of the wave amplitude a(k), which presumably are consequences of general
covariance of the dbi equation, distinguish this theory from other integrable systems, e.g.,

kdv equation and nonlinear schroedinger equation [14].

8

iii. scattering wave solutions to the dirac-born-infeld

equation with constant background fields

in this section, i shall follow the approach by [14] in obtaining the wave solutions of dbi

equation.

a. introduce wave-front coordinates and change of variables

in the usual solution of the linear wave equation,

tt  c2xx = 0,

we dene light-cone coordinates

  x  c t,

  x + c t,

and the wave equation, in terms of the light-cone variables, is

 = 0.

this transformed equation can be integrated and the solutions

(x, t) = f () + g() = f (x  c t) + g(x + c t)

correspond to two non-interacting traveling waves with constant velocities c,c.

we can generalize this method by dening the wave-front coordinates,

  x   t,

  x   t,

together with the inverse relations

x =

  
  

,

t =

  
  

,

(39)

(40)

(41)

(42)

(43)

(44)

where  and  are traveling wave velocities of the dbi equations, eq.(34).

for later convenience, it is useful to reduce the partial dierential equation eq.(20) into

a rst order form, and we introduce

9

u   




= u(, ),

v   




= v(, ).

(45)

with these denitions, the original dbi equation eq.(20) is then transformed into a

coupled system of non-linear rst order p.d.e.s,

u = v,

(integrable condition)

(pv  v2)u + (a + 2uv  pu + qv)u  (qu + u2)v = 0,

(46)

(47)

b. use of hodograph transformation

due to the general covariant property of the dbi lagrangian, one can not transform the

nonlinearity away by performing a coordinate transformation. therefore, we introduce the

hodograph transformation [14] to attack this problem. the general idea of the hodograph

transformation is to exchange the roles of independent variables (, ) and dependent vari-

ables (u, v) in the p.d.e. such that it is possible to obtain linearized equations. in the case

of two independent variables, through the use of chain rules, we have

1 = u

0 = v



u|v = u
u|v = v







u + u
u + v

0 = u

1 = v



v|u = u

(48)

(49)

one can reverse the matrix equation and replace the eld variables u, u, v, and v in terms

of u, v, u, v,

.

(50)

after applying the hodograph transformation to eq.(46), we obtain a linear system of

coupled p.d.e.s,

(integrable condition)

v = u
(qu + u2)u + (a + 2uv  pu + qv)v  (pv  v2)v = 0

(51)

or, equivalently, two linear second order p.d.e.s,

(qu + u2)uu + (a + 2uv  pu + qv)uv + (pv + v2)vv + (q + 2u)u + (p + 2v)v = 0, (52)
(qu + u2)uu + (a + 2uv  pu + qv)uv + (pv + v2)vv + (q + 2u)u + (p + 2v)v = 0. (53)

these equations are then subject to the standard treatment for a solution of hyperbolic

dierential equations.

c. solutions of characteristic equations

to solve the linear p.d.e. eq.(51), we rst need to identify the characteristics of the

hyperbolic systems and change to characteristic variables in order to obtain decoupled wave

equations. the equations which characteristic curves satisfy are extracted from the quadratic

part of the linear p.d.e.. namely,

(qu + u2)dv2  (a + 2uv  pu + qv)dvdu + (v2  pv)du2 = 0,

   du

dv!

=

(a + 2uv  pu + qv) q(a + 2uv  pu + qv)2  4(u2 + qu)(v2  pv)

2(v2  pv)

these characteristic curves are exactly integrable and the solutions are given by

2(u  r2v) = (q + pr2) +q(q + pr2)2 + 4ar2,
2(v  s2u) = (p + qs2) +q(p + qs2)2 + 4as2,

11

(54)

.

(55)

(56)

(57)

where r, s are characteristic variables, which come as integration constants along the char-

acteristic curves eq.(55).

the dening equations given above allow us to generate relations between various deriva-

tives, e.g.,

h(r, s)f1(r),

r
v

= rh(r, s)f1(r),

s
u

= sh(r, s)f2(s),

s
v

=

1
s

h(r, s)f2(s), (58)

r

=

r

where

f1(r)  q(q + pr2)2 + 4ar2,
g(r, s)  p2r2 + q2s2 + (pq + 2a)(1 + r2s2),

f2(s)  q(p + qs2)2 + 4as2,
1  r2s2
g + f1f2

h(r, s) 

.

(59)

rewrite the rst order p.d.e. eq.(51) in terms of the characteristic variables (u, v) 

(r, s), (u, v)  (r, s), we have

r + r2r = 0,

s2s + s = 0.

these equations imply two decoupled wave equations,

rs = rs = 0,

and the solutions are

s2g(s)ds,

(r, s) = f (r) z s
(r, s) = g(s) +z r0

s0

r2f (r)dr,

r

(60)

(61)

(62)

where f (r) and g(s) are arbitrary functions and they are only well-dened up to constants,

which are specied by the choices of s0 and r0.

given these decoupled wave solutions, we can derive the original wave solution in terms

of the characteristic variables, (x, t)  (, )  (u, v)  (r, s),

1

r = r + r = (u  r2v)f (r) =

d. scattering wave solutions in the space-time representation

after various transformations, we arrive at a solution in terms of the characteristic

variables  = (r, s), eq.(65). to study the time evolution and identify physical observables,

we need to re-express the wave solution in terms of space-time variables. first of all, we

dene the shape variables,

  f (r)  r = f 1(),

  g(s)  s = g1(),

and replace the functions f (r), g(s) by

1() 
2()

2 z (cid:20)f1 qf 2

1  4ar2(cid:21) d,

(66)

(67)

(68)

in terms of the shape variables ,  and the new functions 1, 2, the wave solution can be

written in a decoupled form,

 = 1() + 2().

(69)

we can now relate the space-time variables (x, t) to the shape variables (, ), using

eqs.(43) (62) (66),

x   t =  =  z

(73)

solving the inverse relations to determine the functional form of shape variables in terms

(74)

e. d-string proles as scattering events

the space-time representation of wave solutions to the dbi equation, eq.(74), strongly

suggests an interpretation for the time evolution of d-string motion as a scattering event.

for instance, if we identify two localized functions 1, 2 as interacting wave packets, and

assume that they are nonzero only within nite intervals,

1() 6= 0, 2    0;

2() 6= 0,

0    2,

(75)

then one can interpret the wave solution eq.(74) at t  + as a scattered nal state with
phase shifts

d,

(76)

which originates from two incident waves with constant velocities 1(x t) and 2(x t)
at t  .

to see this, examing the long time behavior of eqs.(70) (71), we nd that as long as

localized wave packets are well-behaved (meaning the integrals in eqs.(70) (71) are nite for

any value of  and ), both  and  have to diverge,

t  +    ,

  +

( > 0,  < 0).

(77)

therefore, the transformation rules between ,  and x, t simplies in the t  + limit,
and the nal state wave solution converges to

(x, t  +) = 1(x   t + 1) + 2(x   t  2).

(78)

on the other hand, we see from eq.(72) that  must be less than  for sucient large

negative time t = t0, and before that moment there is no overlap between two wave packets

14

1, 2 due to constraint eq.(75). therefore, we can write the initial state wave solution as

a sum of two independent incident wave packets,

(x, t  ) = 1(x   t) + 2(x   t).

(79)

to summarize, our general solutions show that the scattering event only induces phase

shifts on incoming wave packets and both the wave velocities and the wave proles are

retained after the scattering. while there is no qualitative dierence (except for the singu-

lar cases which are ignored in this study) between the dbi theory with nonzero constant

background elds and the zero eld case for the string dynamics, our solutions give explicit

dependences of wave velocities and phase shifts on the external eld parameters. finally, let

us comment that it is possible to verify these descriptive pictures by choosing a particular

form of 1, 2 and solve for the whole scattering event.

f. scattering phase shifts and the energy momentum of d-string

it is interesting to notice that the phase shift of each scattering wave is entirely induced

by the wave prole of the incident company, eq.(76). as the scattering solutions demon-

strate certain solitonic behaviors, we are curious to know if one can apply any physical

interpretation to these phase shifts.

indeed, barbashov and chernikov have pointed out

that the phase shifts of scattering waves can be related to the energies (or momenta) of the

incoming companies in the case of pure nambu-goto theory. given the analytic expressions

of the phase shifts in terms of the incoming wave proles and constant background elds,

we wish to examine if these connections persist with nonzero backgrounds.

however, a complete solution is beyond our ability and i can only illustrate the physical

meaning of the phase shifts 1, 2 in several special cases. for this purpose, we change the

denition of the dbi lagrangian to

l0  q1  b2

iv. summary and conclusion

in this work, i discuss the scattering wave solutions of the dirac-born-infeld equation in

the presence of constant background elds. using the hodograph transformation and various

change of variables, we are able to reduce the dbi equation into a system of linear partial

dierential equations and obtain exact wave solutions propagating along a d-string. under

suitable conditions, the wave solutions we derived can be interpreted as scattering events

for localized wave packets. our solutions show that the eect of constant background elds

only change the traveling velocities of the incoming waves from the speed of light and the

nal result of the scattering is to induce phase shifts on outgoing waves without modifying

their wave proles. the phase shifts of scattering waves can be related to the energies and

momenta of individual wave packets in the presence of constant background elds. finally,

we give explicit relations between phase shifts and energy-momentum of d-string for several

special cases of background eld parameters.

this work is supported by nsc of taiwan for the research project of investigations of

some non-perturbative phenomena in physics under the budget number nsc 88-2112-m-

002-001-y. i was beneted from many discussions with pei-ming ho, miao li and yeong-

chuan kao.
