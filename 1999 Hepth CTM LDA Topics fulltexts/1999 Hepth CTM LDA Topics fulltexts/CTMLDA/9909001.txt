thus patched together metric automatically solution einsteins equations everywhere except core intersection. global solution exist brane-brane interaction must produce specic contribution tension intersection region, needed match global decit angle. thus still appears one ne tuning nondynamical parameter (or remnant supersymmetry) required. perhaps better understanding brane interactions shed

extra-dimensional metric somehow cleverly avoid usual problems adjustment mechanisms {$9510209$}. since eective four dimensional newtons constant typically depends extra dimensional metric, perhaps higher dimensional conguration found apparent low energy contri- butions four dimensional cosmological constant (e.g. qcd phase transition) actually renormalize newtons constant. conguration described
