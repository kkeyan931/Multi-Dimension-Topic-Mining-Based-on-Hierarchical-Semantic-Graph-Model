# Multi-Dimension-Topic-Mining-Based-on-Hierarchical-Semantic-Graph-Model

Topic mining of scientiﬁc literature can accurately capture the contextual structure of a topic, 
track research hotspots within a ﬁeld, and improve the availability of information about the literature. 
This paper introduces a multi-dimensional topic mining method based on a hierarchical semantic graph 
model. The main innovations include 
        (1) the hierarchical extraction of feature terms and construction of a corresponding semantic graph and
        (2) multi-dimensional topic mining based on graph segmentation and 
            structure analysis. The process of semantic graph construction is based primarily on hierarchical feature 
            term extraction, which can effectively reveal the hierarchical structural distribution of feature terms within 
            documents. Our graph model also takes into account the complementarity of content- and context-related 
            feature terms in documents while avoiding the loss of textual information. In addition, the multi-dimensional 
            features of the topic can be mined effectively via an in-depth analysis of the constructed graph, resulting in 
            a quantitative visualization of the many-to-many association between the topic and feature terms. A variety 
            of experiments on existing document datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to outperform 
            state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efﬁcacy.
